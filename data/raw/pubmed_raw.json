    "title": "Mastering rare event analysis: subsample-size determination in Cox and logistic regressions.",
    "abstract": "In the realm of contemporary data analysis, the use of massive datasets has taken on heightened significance, albeit often entailing considerable demands on computational time and memory. While a multitude of existing works offer optimal subsampling methods for conducting analyses on subsamples with minimized efficiency loss, they notably lack tools for judiciously selecting the subsample size. To bridge this gap, our work introduces tools designed for choosing the subsample size. We focus on three settings: the Cox regression model for survival data with rare events, and logistic regression for both balanced and imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we present a new optimal subsampling procedure tailored to logistic regression with imbalanced data. The efficacy of these tools and procedures is demonstrated through an extensive simulation study and meticulous analyses of two sizable datasets: survival analysis of UK Biobank colorectal cancer data with about 350 million rows and logistic regression of linked birth and infant death data with about 28 million observations.",

    "title": "The cost and cost trajectory of genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for Indigenous children with suspected rare diseases.",
    "abstract": "Indigenous peoples are underrepresented in reference genome libraries. Consequently, rare disease diagnosis may require bespoke bioinformatics analyses of genome sequences. Establishing diagnostic cost is crucial to support policy development for equitable rare disease diagnosis. We estimated the cost and cost trajectory of diagnostic genome sequencing and bioinformatics for Indigenous participants with suspected rare diseases. We conducted a micro-costing study of Indigenous children and their families receiving genome sequencing through Canada's Silent Genomes Project. Invoice data informed the costs of genome sequencing. We conducted a time-and-motion study for bioinformatics analyses, including labor, computing, and data storage costs. With standard bioinformatics, costs ranged from C$3,645 (SD: 455) for singletons to C$7,402 (SD: 566) for trios. With advanced, bespoke bioinformatics, costs ranged from C$5,344 (SD: 634) for singletons to C$9,760 (SD: 822) for trios. Genome sequencing was a primary cost driver, but sequencing costs decreased by 61% over four years. Bioinformatics costs ranged from 21.3% to 58.3% of total costs. The time required for bioinformatics ranged from 71 hours to 215 hours for standard and advanced analyses, respectively. Genome sequencing costs decreased over time. Bioinformatics is a significant cost driver, particularly for bespoke analyses arising from non-representative reference libraries.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a genetically diverse group of Mendelian disorders characterized by length-dependent axonal degeneration. Microtubule dysfunction is a known mechanism in HSP that impairs axonal dynamics. TBCB encodes Tubulin folding co-factor B (TBCB), which, along with TBCE, regulates αβ-heterodimer dynamics and neuronal axonal growth. Here, we describe a new form of complicated HSP caused by a founder variant in TBCB. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.589T>A p.(Tyr197Asn) variant in TBCB in a cohort of ten individuals assembled through genematching tools. Protein function was assessed using Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue ALF1, and a CRISPR-Cas9-generated homologous mutant in Drosophila melanogaster. TBCB expression and localization were examined in fibroblasts using western blot and immunofluorescence. Participants displayed late childhood onset spastic paraparesis, global developmental delay and autism spectrum. TBCB protein levels were reduced in affected fibroblasts. The ALF1 mutant in yeast increased benomyl sensitivity, resembling a loss-of-function phenotype. In Drosophila melanogaster, the homologous mutant led to reduced survival and impaired climbing ability. We describe a novel neurodevelopmental disorder with spastic paraparesis and a high carrier rate in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Our results indicate that TBCB has a vital role in CNS development and potentially in axonal function in humans.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide and claims roughly 700,000 lives each year; nearly 50% of global HCC fatalities occur in China. To conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis identifying predictors of sorafenib efficacy in combination with thermal ablation for HCC treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to October 2024, reviewing 720 identified studies. From these, 19 studies were selected that included a total of 3,341 participants with HCC at baseline. The meta-analysis examined the effects of sorafenib in combination with physical thermal ablation, using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Analyses were performed using two-sided methods and either fixed-effect or random-effects models, depending on the level of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis revealed that combining physical thermal ablation with sorafenib significantly improved outcomes in HCC patients: Overall survival (OS) was more than doubled (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.55-2.67; p < 0.001), recurrence rates were significantly reduced (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.39-0.98; p = 0.04), and overall treatment efficacy was markedly higher (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.61-3.96; p < 0.001) compared with thermal ablation alone. In individuals with HCC, physical thermal ablation and sorafenib had significantly higher OS, lower recurrence rates, and high overall efficacy compared to physical thermal ablation. To validate this discovery, more research is needed, and caution must be implemented when interacting with its values.",

    "abstract": "MiRNAs play crucial roles in cell proliferation, metabolism, and signal transduction, and have been established as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment for many years. Traditional methods for detecting miRNAs have several drawbacks, including poor sensitivity, time-consuming processes, and laborious steps. We have combined nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) with DNAzyme to develop a single-tube detection platform for highly sensitive and rapid detection of miRNA-21. The target miRNA activates NEAR to produce many single-stranded DNAs, which hybridize to another DNA strand in the system to form a cleavage-active magnesium ion-dependent DNAzyme. When magnesium ions are present in the system, DNAzyme degrades the FQ reporter to generate a fluorescent signal to achieve highly sensitive and rapid detection of miRNA. This assay enables highly sensitive detection of miRNAs with a detection limit of 1.91 pM. The assay is a one-tube reaction, and miRNA detection can be completed in approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. These results indicate that this biosensor has a broad application prospect in cancer diagnosis and treatment based on miRNA detection.",

Herein, we designed two cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes with moderate zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) affinity, capable of re-distributing the endogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm and vesicles to mitochondria as indicated by ICP-MS measurement, thus inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondria-targeted Ir2 also displayed better immunoregulation activity than lysosome-targeted Ir1, capable of triggering GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis <i>via</i> caspase-1 dependent pathway and down-regulating PD-L1 levels in cancer cells. In macrophages, Ir2 also re-distributed intracellular zinc effectively, leading to an increased zinc level in mitochondria and promoting the M0-to-M1 polarization of macrophages. The antitumor efficacy and immunoregulation activity were also verified <i>in vivo</i>. This work suggested that the modulation of endogenous zinc homeostasis both in cancer cells and immune cells would be a promising strategy for activating anti-tumour immunity, and provided new clues for designing novel metallodrugs for cancer chemo-immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis frequently occurs in patients with prostate cancer, however, a consensus has not been reached regarding bone scan image analysis. We aimed to analyse various bone scan imaging features of metastatic prostate cancer and to assess their impact on prognosis. One thousand five hundred sixty-three paired sets of bone scan images (anterior and posterior) were obtained from patients with metastatic prostate cancer at Seoul National University Hospital. U-Net architecture was used for the segmentation of metastatic bone lesions. Imaging features describing the overall metastatic burden (n = 18) and largest metastatic burden (n = 32) were extracted using computer vision techniques. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional risk model were used to analyse the prognostic impact of each feature. The correlation coefficient between the actual number of lesions and that predicted by the deep learning model was 0.87, indicating a strong correlation. Multivariate Cox regression showed that metastasis intensity difference (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; <i>P</i> = 0.002) and the largest metastasis percentage (HR, 0.62; <i>P</i> = 0.038) were independently associated with disease progression and were even more strongly associated with the number of metastases (current standard). The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that a higher total metastasis ratio (<i>P</i> < 0.001), a lower total metastasis intensity difference (<i>P</i> = 0.030), a lower largest metastatic lesion percentage (<i>P</i> < 0.001), higher compactness (<i>P</i> = 0.028), and lower eccentricity (<i>P</i> = 0.070) were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Although the number of bone metastases is a standardised prognostic factor, additional consideration of morphological or intensity-related novel features may be useful to more accurately predict the prognosis of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "We describe the immunophenotyping and genetic analysis of HIV-uninfected apparently immunocompetent adults presenting with disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococci are environmentally ubiquitous fungi that may cause disseminated infection including meningitis. Cryptococcosis occurs predominantly in immunocompromised hosts and most commonly in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In apparently immunocompetent patients, cryptococcal disease is rare, often diagnosed later and associated with higher mortality. The immunologic work-up and management of this patient group is challenging and poorly studied. Between 2015-2021, eight apparently immunocompetent adults at the time of diagnosis with cryptococcosis underwent extensive diagnostic immunological work-up including T-/B-cell subsets, immunoglobulins, T-cell proliferation and phenotyping, serum-specific antibody responses, mannose binding lectin, measurement of selected cytokines, anti-cytokine autoantibodies and targeted genetic next-generation sequencing. The production of interleukin (IL)-17 following phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was significantly reduced in all eight patients with cryptococcosis compared to healthy controls (median IL-17 concentration in whole blood stimulation assay 88.1pg/mL in patients; 452.1pg/mL in controls, p=0.0047). In 5/5 patients tested, the percentage of CD4+ T-cells positive for IL-17, including memory CD4+CD45RO+ IL-17+ T-cells, after stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) was significantly reduced (<=0.4% cells). Reduced IgM+ memory B-cells were noted in 4/5 tested. 4/8 patients were found to have CD4 lymphopaenia. One patient with Cryptococcus gattii infection had autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). No underlying genetic causes were identified. Patients had several immunological risk factors, but reduced IL-17 production was a striking feature across the cohort - a phenotype that may facilitate tailored immunotherapeutic approaches.Graphical Abstract.",

However, the excessively wide bandgap of inorganic sonosensitizers and the easy recombination of electron-hole pairs limit the yield of ROS of sonosensitizers. Herein, for the first time, we report carbon dot (CD)-sensitized hollow Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8-<i>x</i></sub> as a novel inorganic sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic tumor therapy. The presence of sulfur vacancies endows Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> with excellent sonodynamic and chemodynamic activities.

In this study, we propose a nanoplatform (CuS@GOx@ES) that integrates chemodynamic therapy (CDT), starvation therapy (ST), photothermal therapy (PTT), and copper-induced toxicity for enhanced cancer treatment. CuS nanoparticles, with their large surface area, are ideal for CDT, while glucose oxidase (GOx) depletes tumor glucose for ST and catalyzes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production for a Fenton-like reaction. The glucose depletion generates gluconic acid, which accelerates CuS degradation and Cu<sup>2+</sup> release, enhancing both CDT and copper-induced toxicity. CuS also exhibits excellent photothermal properties and enhances PTT under 808 nm NIR irradiation. The increased temperature further amplifies the effects of CDT and copper-induced toxicity. Additionally, CuS serves as an exogenous source of copper, releasing Cu<sup>2+</sup> into the tumor microenvironment (TME), where it binds to the copper ion carrier ES for targeted delivery to tumor cells, inducing copper-induced toxicity and tumor cell death. The CuS@GOx@ES nanoplatform effectively combines CDT, PTT, ST, and copper-induced toxicity, creating a synergistic effect where the treatments enhance each other to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Reliable data on optimal fluid management in the perioperative period for patients with advanced ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery is limited. These patients often present with malignant ascites and are prone to significant fluid shifts perioperatively. For this reason, our objective was to define clinical targets for optimal fluid balance and determine whether initial ascites should be included in fluid-loss calculations by examining the association between perioperative fluid balance and major postoperative complications. This prospective, observational study conducted in a centralized and public healthcare system setting in Sweden between 2020 and 2023 included patients with advanced ovarian cancer, > 18 years of age, scheduled for upfront cytoreductive surgery, an ASA physical status I-III with no speech/language issues. The primary outcome was major postoperative complication within 30 days of surgery. The measurements of fluid input and output, cut-offs for fluid balance, perioperative time, and postoperative complications were defined a priori. The association between fluid balance and major postoperative complications was assessed by multivariable regression, adjusted for predefined covariates, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Of 175 enrolled patients, 162 were included in the final analysis. In the adjusted analysis, there was a significant association between fluid balance of 1750-2700 mL, OR 3.40 (95% CI 1.06-10.9; p = 0.04) and > 2700 mL, OR 3.91 (95% CI 1.33-11.5; p = 0.01) and major postoperative complications. When including initial ascites as fluid loss, a balance of > 2700 mL was associated with major postoperative complications, OR 2.59 (95% CI 1.01-6.66, p = 0.047). An optimal target for perioperative fluid balance to decrease the odds of major postoperative complications is suggested to be < 1750 mL. If initial ascites is included as loss in the calculation of balance, the optimal target of fluid balance is suggested to be < 2700 mL. These results provide practical clinical reference values that may assist anesthesiologists and surgical teams in optimizing perioperative fluid management in advanced ovarian cancer. This secondary analysis of a trial ovarian cancer operative cohort assessed the relation of the estimated fluid balance over the operative day 24 h to major postoperative complications. The findings showed that the groups where the fluid balance was in the categories higher and also most positive had higher odds for having a major complication compared to the group with lowest fluid balance. Ascities fluid was an issue in this cohort, which was managed in the analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04065009.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) systematically orchestrate multiple biological processes via gene regulation in various organisms. Conventionally, miRNAs bind to untranslated regions of mRNAs to modulate gene silencing in the cytoplasm. Recent studies have revealed that a subset of miRNAs located in the nucleus can efficiently activate gene transcription by targeting enhancers, named as Nuclear Activating miRNAs (NamiRNAs). The fundamental principle of this regulatory pattern is that NamiRNAs as \"wedges\" open double strands of genomic DNA and provide the prerequisite for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Specifically, NamiRNAs bind to their target enhancers and form the hybrids of miRNAs and single-stranded DNA, which are recognized by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to maintain the single-stranded state. Meanwhile, AGO2 protects these miRNA-DNA hybrids from RNase H-mediated degradation to maintain their stability. Additionally, NamiRNAs induce H3K27ac enrichment at target enhancers and put them into an active state conducive to gene activation. Notably, similar to NamiRNAs, Human Identical Sequences as exogenous small RNAs as critical pathogenic factors for RNA viruses, facilitate infectious disease progression. Collectively, this review systematically elucidates the theory of NamiRNA-Enhancer-mediated Gene Activation in combination with corresponding evidence, summarizes the functions and challenges of NamiRNAs, and discusses their potential in fundamental research and clinical applications.",

Effective first-line targeted therapies are crucial for improving outcomes, particularly when combined with second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies. This study examined the effects of first-line cetuximab+FOLFIRI versus bevacizumab+FOLFIRI, followed by second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, on survival among patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC without primary tumor resection (PTR). A retrospective analysis of Taiwanese data (2013-2019) included patients with KRAS wild-type unresectable mCRC who received first-line cetuximab+FOLFIRI or bevacizumab+FOLFIRI, followed by second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Survival outcomes-overall survival (OS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD)-were compared between these regimens using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for potential confounders, followed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to account for clinical and biological variables. In patients without PTR, first-line cetuximab+FOLFIRI with second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved OS from the start dates of first- and second-line treatment compared to first-line bevacizumab+FOLFIRI with second-line oxaliplatin-based therapy, yielding adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.78) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42-0.73), respectively.

A survey was conducted among 77 members of the Korean Society of Coloproctology and 25 members of the Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The survey assessed decision-making regarding additional surgery after endoscopic resection for high-risk T1 colorectal cancer according to various predicted LNM rates (3%, 10%, and 27%) and tumor locations (anal verge [AV] 2, 7, and 25 cm). Additionally, participants provided feedback regarding the reliability, usefulness, and potential adoptability of the prediction model in patient counseling. Of the 2,314 surveys distributed, 102 responses were analyzed. A trend was observed in which tumors located closer to the anus and associated with a lower predicted risk of LNM were less likely to lead respondents to opt for surgery (e.g., AV 2 cm and 3% of predicted LNM risk, 21.6% opt for surgery vs. AV 25 cm and 27% of predicted LNM risk, 98.0% opt for surgery).

The purpose of this study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of a VTE prophylaxis program using the Caprini score in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal cancer surgery with the ERAS protocol. This retrospective cross-sectional study included 1,043 colorectal cancer patients requiring surgery from January 2017 to December 2019, divided into a control group (≤75 years) and an elderly group (>75 years), with 827 and 216 patients, respectively. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE; secondary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications, particularly bleeding. The incidence of VTE was 1.5% in the control group and 3.7% in the elderly group (P=0.061). Five patients (0.5%) experienced symptomatic VTE, and the Caprini score for all VTE patients was ≤8 points; thus, only mechanical prophylaxis was used. In the multivariable logistic regression, the Caprini score (P=0.024) and cancer stage (P=0.004) were selected. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the Caprini score and TNM staging were 1.758 (1.078-2.867) and 6.152 (2.045-26.510), respectively. When the ERAS protocol was used for patients with colorectal cancer as perioperative care, the VTE risk was lower than that estimated by the Caprini score. Given that age is a recognized risk factor for major bleeding, criteria for the use of anticoagulation to prevent VTE, particularly in elderly patients, should be carefully evaluated, considering both the bleeding risks and the potential benefits of pharmacologic prophylaxis.

The liver is a commonly damaged organ during sepsis and also an important organ for releasing acute response proteins. However, whether pyroptosis occurs and the function of GSDMD in hepatocytes remains unclear. It is surprising to find that hepatocyte-specific GSDMD knockout (GSDMD<sup>hep-/-</sup>) mice have significantly reduced survival rates, markedly elevated systemic inflammation, and increased inflammation in the peritoneal cavity and lungs, suggesting that the absence of GSDMD in hepatocytes promotes systemic inflammatory responses. Serum proteomic analysis shows that anti-inflammatory factors such as VEGF-B and Gremlin-1 are significantly reduced in GSDMD<sup>hep-/-</sup> mice. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments combined with a constructed full-length GSDMD and a mutant GSDMD plasmid (GSDMD-c.D276A) that cannot be cleaved, VEGF-B and Gremlin-1 are verified to be released from hepatocytes through the pore-forming activity of GSDMD, thus inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors by macrophages. More importantly, hepatocyte-specific replenishment of full-length GSDMD can reverse the exacerbated inflammatory response in GSDMD<sup>hep-/-</sup> mice. These findings together establish that hepatic GSDMD plays a key protective role in sepsis by promoting the release of anti-inflammatory factors through pore formation in hepatocytes.",

However, the extent of changes in coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores postradiation and the influencing factors remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated studies investigating changes in CAC scores following breast cancer radiation therapy. Data abstraction was independently performed by two unblinded reviewers using structured collection forms, with no divergences in data collection. The nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scoring system assessed methodological quality. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Among eight studies (1972 patients), radiation doses ranged from 47 to 60 Grays. The overall rate of CAC score increase or new appearance postradiation was 25.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21.3-30.8%]. The rate was significantly higher after left-sided radiation at 32.3% (95% CI, 25.7-39.6%) compared to 16.1% (95% CI, 5.8-37.3%) for right-sided radiation. CAC score development occurs in approximately one-quarter of breast cancer patients after radiation therapy, with a significantly higher risk following left-sided radiation. These findings underscore the need for tailored monitoring strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks in this population.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and the Western Pacific, is regulated by type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, in which STAT2 is critical. However, STAT2's exact role in JEV-mediated IFN evasion remains unclear. Existing murine models of JEV infection predominantly employ high viral titers to induce encephalitis and primarily use immunocompetent or IFN receptor-deficient mice, limiting their utility for studying JEV's IFN evasion mechanisms. To address this, we developed a humanized STAT2 mouse model (NCG-hSTAT2+/+) and infected it with 10³ PFU of JEV-p3. These mice exhibited severe encephalitis resembling clinical human infections, characterized by elevated viral loads, and increased proinflammatory cytokines. Especially, it presents typical neurological symptoms, such as activated astrocytes and distinct neuropathological changes. This suggests that NCG-hSTAT2+/+ mice exhibit higher susceptibility to JEV and more severe neurological symptoms, which is consistent with that observed in clinical patients exhibited. This model significantly advances the study of JEV pathogenesis, therapeutic evaluation, and understanding of human STAT2's role in neuroinvasion and immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) nanoparticles are widely used to transport therapeutic agents to cancer sites and rapidly release them owing to their rapid biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of these DMOS nanoparticles as nanocarriers is limited, and their applications remain relatively simple. In this study, Fe<sup>3+</sup>-doped dendritic mesoporous organosilica (Fe-DMOS) nanoparticles are designed as a new type of ferroptosis inducer and are combined with sodium hyaluronate-modified calcium peroxide to form TME-responsive nanocomposites. The nanocomposites can effectively generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction between the released Fe<sup>3+</sup> and self-compensated hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial injury caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload further promotes this process. Both Fe<sup>3+</sup> and disulfide bonds can induce glutathione depletion, thus downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 and triggering lethal levels of lipid peroxidation products, further facilitating ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the ferroptosis-mediated process of immunogenic cell death promotes a long-term antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis of tumor cells with the assistance of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1). Fe-DMOS nanoparticles are synthesized with ferroptosis-inducing capabilities and established TME-responsive nanocomposites combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor to effectively improve tumor immunotherapy.",

In this work, a targeted phosphorescent nanoprobe is prepared based on a pyrene/benzophenone (PyBP) guest-host system and further functionalized it with folic acid and cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide for enhanced tumor specificity. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) xenograft models, this dual-ligand nanoprobe can help achieve a four-fivefold increase in the tumor signal over the background. Notably, the previously unexplored relationship between tumor stiffness and RTP emission is studied. Mechanical and histological analyses confirmed increased stiffness in OSCC tissues. By modulating the rigidity of tumor phantoms and treating the xenografts with collagenase, a direct correlation is revealed between tumor stiffness and phosphorescence intensity. This study suggests the effectiveness of dual targeting in improving tumor visualization using guest-host-doped RTP nanoprobes. The findings demonstrate that the biomechanical features of the tumor microenvironment enhance phosphorescence emission, highlighting tumor stiffness as a natural amplifier for RTP imaging.",

Descriptive statistics were conducted to analyze the frequency of types of claims. Relevant infant and toddler products available in New Zealand supermarkets were identified through a packaged food database of products collected in 2023. Two hundred and ten products were identified: 167 infant and 43 toddler products. On average, there were 7.5 unique claims per product (range 3-15), with composition and nutrition claims being the most common (mean 4.0 per product), followed by marketing (3.3) and health claims (0.2). Composition and nutrition claims relating to the absence of ingredients generally perceived to be harmful (i.e. 'free from' claims) were prevalent on 97% of products and most commonly referred to flavors (on 72% of products) and colors (71%).

    "abstract": "Melanoma presents as an increasingly prevalent and intricate skin cancer, characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment that features various mutations and the activation of melanogenesis pathways. Dynamic changes within this microenvironment, including increased ROS levels, acidity, and enzyme expression, specifically upregulation of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and MMP2, amongst other enzymes, further contribute to its complexity. Despite advancements in melanoma treatment and FDA approval of therapies targeting specific pathways and employing immune checkpoint inhibitors, challenges persist in melanoma treatment, particularly in optimizing drug delivery and navigating the intricate tumor microenvironment. Recent research has increasingly focused on integrating biomaterials into melanoma treatment, yielding promising results. These biomaterials find application in melanoma diagnosis, treatment, and imaging. Studies have sparked interest in uncovering the therapeutic potential of stimuli-responsive biomaterials. pH-responsive systems offer the prospect of targeted drug release in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, light- and temperature-responsive materials offer spatiotemporal control, aiding melanoma death processes such as necroptosis, apoptosis, and necrosis. Biomaterials responsive to ROS and enzymes address the intricacies of melanoma biology, enhancing treatment specificity. Additionally, multiple stimuli-responsive platforms present a holistic approach for heightened therapeutic efficacy. This review navigates the intricate terrain of melanoma treatment, addressing current therapy limitations and envisioning a future where functionalized biomaterials are pivotal in more effective and targeted interventions. We evaluate multifaceted approaches harnessing distinct biological, physical, and chemical stimuli, and their synergistic combinations to enhance drug delivery precision and other mechanisms in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Earlier we showed that JMJD6 interacted with HOTAIR promoter (-123 to -103 bp, termed JIR) and for maximal induction, an additional (-216 to -123 bp) region was required. In silico prediction and ENCODE data from MCF7 cells showed YBX1 peaks in this region (YIR). Publicly available mass spectrometry data of proteins following JMJD6 immunoprecipitation identified YBX1 as an interacting partner. In this study, we validate JMJD6-YBX1 interaction in breast cancer cell lines using co-immunoprecipitation assays with recombinant, endogenous and in vitro synthesized proteins. Domain mapping using deletion constructs revealed that A/P domain of YBX1 interacted with JMJC domain of JMJD6. These proteins also positively regulated each other's expression in breast cancer cell lines. Further, YBX1 augmented luciferase activity of HOTAIR promoter constructs, pHP216 and pHP123, in MCF7, Vec and JMJD6 overexpressing (JOE) cells. siRNA mediated depletion, mutation of YIR region or knocking out YBX1 (YKO cells) diminished luciferase activity. ChIP and ChIP-re-ChIP assays verified co-occupancy of both proteins in the HOTAIR promoter region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed complex formation with YIR and JIR probes. Mutation of YIR region and YKO resulted in loss of complex formation with both probes. Taken together these data imply that YBX1 is crucial for physically recruiting JMJD6 to HOTAIR promoter. Their interaction and positive feed forward loop perpetuated by JMJD6 and YBX1 inter-regulation culminates in HOTAIR induction, which in turn, is known to drive tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for imaging lipids, proteins, <i>N</i>-glycans, metabolites, and drugs in situ. A key step in MALDI MSI is matrix deposition, which must balance the extraction of molecules from the surface of the tissue without inducing excessive analyte delocalization. Further, MALDI MSI spatial resolution is limited by the size of the matrix crystals formed during matrix deposition. Minimizing crystal size is paramount to obtaining detailed images and refined data. Sublimation has been shown to be a reliable method of depositing matrix while minimizing crystal size. Since sublimation does not use any solvents to deposit the matrix, it is also theorized to minimize analyte delocalization. However, these same solvents are thought to aid in analyte extraction, which may limit detection by sublimation. In this study, we compared crystal size, analyte delocalization, and signal intensity differences when using a commercial automatic pneumatic sprayer and a sublimator for lipid imaging analyses. We tested three matrices: α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) on mouse brain, heart, and kidney. Our results revealed that crystal size depended upon the matrix and whether the crystals formed on or off tissue. Our data also showed that only a subset of the lipid spectrum was susceptible to increased delocalization from spraying and decreased signal intensity from sublimation.",

However, most of these transporters cause harm to healthy cells as well, limiting their applicability in real biological systems. Here, we report a pyrrole-linked benzimidazolyl-hydrazone that self-assembles to form a nanochannel assembly across the lipid bilayer, enabling the selective translocation of HCl, a system rarely reported in the literature. The channel shows an extraordinarily high HCl transport activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> value as low as 0.016 mol%, relative to lipid. We demonstrate solid-state evidence that compound 1 self-assembles in the presence of HCl to produce organized arrays that include chloride-filled and water-filled channels. The formation of a stable HCl channel across the lipid bilayer membrane was verified through electrophysiological experiments, detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. When tested in cellular systems, the compound showed pronounced toxicity toward cancerous cell lines while remaining relatively nontoxic to cell lines of non-cancerous origin. Interestingly, compound 1 was also found to inhibit the growth and proliferation of MCF-7-derived 3D spheroids with higher efficiency when compared to the commercially available anticancer drug─doxorubicin (DOX).",

Current clinical trials are evaluating ADCs as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., durvalumab, tislelizumab) and intravesical therapies, aiming to refine dosing regimens and maximize therapeutic efficacy. The findings underscore the potential of ADCs to revolutionize NMIBC management by providing novel bladder-sparing strategies in patients traditionally limited by BCG failure.

Finding gastric cancer biomarkers is essential to comprehending its pathophysiology and creating novel targeted treatments. Following the acquisition and processing of the gastric cancer sample, the single-cell RNA sequencing data, monocyte subpopulation characterization, and cell type identification were performed. Key gene modules linked to gastric-cancer-related monocytes were identified using high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Machine-learning diagnostic models were created utilizing the discovered gastric-cancer-related monocyte-related genes (GCRMORGs). A prognostic model was developed with the uridine phosphatase 1 (UPP1)-related risk scores and verified in separate cohorts, and multiple immunological analyses were performed. Finally, using various experimental assays, we thoroughly investigated the function of the UPP1 gene in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer samples showed a distinct immune milieu topography with an abundance of monocytes. Eventually, 32 GCRMORGs were identified. Diagnostic models demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in differentiating between patients with gastric cancer and the control group. The prognostic model showed significant predictive value for gastric cancer patients' survival. At the same time, we have confirmed from experimental perspectives that a poor prognosis for patients is indicated by a high expression of UPP1 in gastric cancer tissue. Important monocyte subpopulations associated with gastric cancer samples were detected in our investigation. The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer can be predicted using a predictive model based on 32 GCRMORGs.

We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of MYC expression in breast cancer among adolescents and young adults. MYC expression in 42 adolescents and young adults and 110 older adults were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical c-myc expression was higher in adolescents and young adults group compared to older adults, without MYC gene amplification. In older adults, c-myc expression was associated with more aggressive features. Adolescents and young adults group showed higher c-myc expression even in tumors with less aggressive features, such as estrogen receptor positive, low Ki-67 labeling index, and early clinical stage, than older adults. RNA sequencing revealed higher expression of cholecystokinin B receptor and lower expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2 family member B4 in c-myc positive tumors of adolescents and young adults group. The preference of positive cases for both c-myc and cholecystokinin B receptor was significantly higher in adolescents and young adults group.

Here, we present a pluripotent-stem-cell-based 3D ectodermal organoid model that faithfully recapitulates early ectodermal patterning of future central nervous system, epidermis and cranial and trunk NC, as well as a diverse selection of NC derivatives -offering a comprehensive platform to study neurocristopathies from early induction of pluripotent-like stem cells at the neural plate border to differentiated cells. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion of ∼fifty genes, many of which play broad roles during embryogenesis. While DGS is traditionally considered to originate from all germ layers, its clinical manifestations-including craniofacial anomalies, cardiac outflow tract defects, thymic hypoplasia and thyroid dysfunction-are consistent with tissues requiring NC contributions. This raises the question why DGS mainly manifest in organs of NC origin? Using patient-derived iPSCs, we show that DGS organoids display reduced pluripotency gene expression and impaired maintenance of ectodermal stem cells, leading to defective NC specification, posteriorization of cranial NC, and failure to form cartilage. We identify a small subset of genes within the DGS deletion as potential drivers of these early NC defects. Consequently, impaired NC cells are further affected during cranial and vagal mesenchyme maturation, likely worsened by hemizygosity of additional DGS genes that individually, without the initial NC defect, are insufficient to cause the disease.

RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis has been widely used to study gene expressions underlying mosquito life traits such as development, reproduction, immunity, metabolism, and behavior. While it is widely appreciated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed ubiquitously in transcriptomes across metazoans, lncRNAs remain relatively underexplored in <i>An. gambiae</i>, including their identity, expression profiles, and biological functions. The lncRNA genes were poorly annotated in the current reference of the PEST genome of <i>An. gambiae</i>. In this study, a set of publicly available RNA-seq datasets was leveraged to identify lncRNAs across diverse contexts, including whole mosquitoes, mosquito cells or tissues including hemocytes, midguts, and salivary glands, as well as under different physiological conditions including sugar-feeding, blood-feeding, bacterial challenges, and <i>Plasmodium</i> infections. A Transcript Discovery module implemented in CLC genomics workbench was used to identify lncRNAs from selected published RNA-seq datasets. Across this pool of transcriptomes, 2684 unique lncRNA genes, comprising 4082 transcripts, were identified. Following their identification, these lncRNA genes were integrated into the mosquito transcriptome annotation, which was then used as a reference to analyze both mRNAs and lncRNAs for transcriptional dynamics in different conditions. Unsurprisingly and similar to what has been reported for mRNAs, lncRNAs exhibited context-dependent expression patterns. Co-expression networks constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted the interconnections among lncRNAs and mRNAs, which provides potential functional networks in which these lncRNAs are involved. Furthermore, we identified polysome-associated lncRNAs within polysome-captured transcripts, suggesting the involvement of lncRNAs in translation regulation and coding capacity for micropeptides. The analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset unveiled a correlation of transcriptional activities between lncRNAs and observed epigenetic signatures. Overall, our study demonstrated that lncRNAs are transcribed alongside mRNAs in various biological contexts. The genome-wide annotation of lncRNA genes and integration into the PEST reference genome enables the co-analysis of mRNA and lncRNA simultaneously, which will enhance our understanding of their functions, shedding light on their regulatory roles in <i>An. gambiae</i> biology.",

It is estimated that between 20% and 30% of the global population suffer from some form of non-cancer chronic pain. Around 80% of surgical patients report postoperative acute pain, with less than 50% achieving adequate pain control. Despite these statistics, the management of pain still remains a significant challenge for clinicians, with many patients experiencing poorly controlled pain or adverse effects related to analgesic medication. This literature review outlines current pain management strategies, focusing on non-oral postoperative pain therapies, including injectable drug delivery systems (such as in situ forming implants, micro- and nano-based formulations) and implantable drug delivery systems. Emphasis is placed on solid implantable devices designed for sustained drug delivery, which can offer more efficient localized drug delivery at the pain site. While pharmacological treatments, including oral opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are commonly used, implantable controlled release systems are emerging as more effective alternatives.

Among these, wildfire-related PM is particularly harmful due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, triggering more oxidative and inflammatory response, and contribute to the onset and exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies show that short-term exposure to wildfire smoke has been associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and pneumonia, resulting in increased mortality and healthcare utilization. Long-term exposure may contribute to the development and progression of COPD and is potentially associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and mortality. These findings highlight the serious threat it poses to both individual and public health, contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, and associated socio-economic costs. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent research on the respiratory health effects associated with wildfire smoke exposure. By presenting these findings, this review aims to inform healthcare professionals and public health policymakers, facilitating evidence-based strategies for clinical care, public health education, and disaster preparedness in the light of growing threat posed by wildfires.",

    "abstract": "Diradical-Pt<sup>II</sup> complexes with <i>o</i>-phenylenediamine ligands exhibit intense near-infrared (NIR) absorption, making them applicable as photothermal agents for cancer imaging and therapy. However, their NIR-absorbing properties can be deactivated by ligand exchange with cellular substances such as glutathione (GSH). To improve the kinetic stability of diradical-Pt<sup>II</sup> complexes, we synthesized two novel tetradentate ligands, 4,4'-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(azanediyl))bis(3-aminobenzenesulfonate) (EABS) and 4,4'-(propane-1,3-diylbis(azanediyl))bis(3-aminobenzenesulfonate) (PABS), in which two 3,4-diaminobenzenesulfonate (DABS) units are connected by an ethylene or propylene linker, respectively. Contrary to the expectation that the resulting chelate ring will enhance stability, [Pt(EABS)]<sup>2-</sup> readily released its linker to form [Pt(DABS)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> owing to its bent and twisted coordination structure. In contrast, [Pt(PABS)]<sup>2-</sup> was stable owing to its less distorted structure and exhibited an intense absorption peak at 723 nm (8.7 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) in aqueous solution. Kinetic analysis of the ligand exchange reaction with GSH showed that the half-life of [Pt(PABS)]<sup>2-</sup> under intracellular conditions ([GSH] = 1.0 × 10<sup>-2</sup> M) is 27 h, approximately 1300 and 16 000 times longer than those of [Pt(DABS)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> (72 s) and [Pt(EABS)]<sup>2-</sup> (5.9 s), respectively. Thus, the linker chain length significantly influences molecular structure and kinetic stability against GSH, with the propylene linker effectively enhancing the stability of diradical-Pt<sup>II</sup> complexes. Additionally, ligand oxidation gradually extinguished the NIR absorption of aqueous [Pt(PABS)]<sup>2-</sup>, which would prevent unpredictable photothermal damage to healthy tissues after treatment. The ligand design of [Pt(PABS)]<sup>2-</sup> is expected to enable efficient imaging and therapy for cancer with minimal side effects.",

    "abstract": "This MRI-based study investigates factors influencing and predictors of margin status in neoadjuvant therapy followed by patients with breast-conserving surgery (NAT-BCS) and evaluates associated locoregional/distant control outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 117 consecutive patients with breast cancer (BC) who underwent NAT-BCS between June 2014 and June 2024. All patients received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations both before and after NAT. Univariate analysis identified factors influencing surgical margin status as molecular subtype (with HER2+ showing the lowest positive rate, followed sequentially by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), Luminal B HER2+, Luminal A, and Luminal B HER2-), nonmass enhancement (NME) on pre-NAT MRI, axillary lymph node metastasis, post-NAT MRI shrinkage pattern, postoperative pathological complete response (pCR) status, pN status, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI); however, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only LVI independently affected margin status, and NME on pre-NAT MRI independently predicted margin status, with 106 patients ultimately undergoing BCS, exhibiting a locoregional recurrence (LRR) rate of 1.9% (2/106) and a distant metastasis (DM) rate of 2.8% (3/106). The presence of NME on pre-NAT MRI could be a predictor for margin status, possibly informing surgical strategy formulation. Concurrently, LVI might represent a distinct determinant influencing margin outcomes. NAT-BCS therapy has achieved favorable local-regional and distant control outcomes.",

The well-established Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) national model improves palliative care quality. This study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators perceived by healthcare providers to integrating the PCOC model in a Chinese hospital-based palliative care unit. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured focus group and individual interviews. A rapid deductive analysis approach was selected for data analysis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework was used to guide the study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Eighteen healthcare professionals participated in this study, four focus group interviews and five individual interviews were completed. Barriers to the PCOC integration included clinical application and workload concerns (patients in terminal stage, patients' dialects, workload concerns, and staff shortages); attitudinal barriers (negative attitudes toward PCOC); psychological barriers (numbness to their work) and barriers related to knowledge and self-efficacy (lack of knowledge, capacity, and self-efficacy in palliative care). Facilitators included adapting the program to local contexts, ongoing education and feedback, effective PCOC data use, a supportive work and clinical environment and staff's perceived advantages of the model across clinical, research and process domains. The successful integration of the PCOC program hinges on local adaptation, improved data utilization, education, and IT support. In regions with less developed palliative care, enhancing professionals' knowledge and self-efficacy is crucial. Incorporating assessment and clinical response protocols into technology can accelerate palliative care development and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) is a rare, autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in NR2F1, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, optic nerve anomalies, and autism spectrum disorder. Most pathogenic variants cluster within the highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) or ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR2F1 and are associated with variable clinical severity, suggesting a genotype-phenotype correlation. While previous mouse models have provided important insights, comprehensive behavioral characterization remains limited. Here, we present two novel BBSOAS mouse models harboring patient-specific variants in the DBD (Nr2f1+/R139L) and LBD (Nr2f1+/E397*), alongside the established Nr2f1+/- model. We analyzed both brain morphology and behavior to further expand the murine phenotype and investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation. We demonstrate that these models recapitulate key aspects of the BBSOAS phenotype, including deficits in cognition, social communication, and motor function, and that the presence and severity of behavioral abnormalities are dependent on variant type. Our findings provide new evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation associated with domain-specific NR2F1 variants and establish a robust platform for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "Iron, as an essential element, plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper functioning of all living organisms. While the appropriate level of iron for the optimal functioning of organisms cannot be disregarded, an excessive amount of this element can be detrimental and give rise to various issues. Nonetheless, the condition of iron accumulation is exceedingly uncommon in the majority of individuals due to the presence of biological autoregulation systems. However, in certain genetic disorders, such as β - thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, and others, the nature of the diseases or treatment procedures can lead to an overload of iron. Furthermore, numerous studies have substantiated the role of iron in exacerbating conditions in some non-iron-dependent disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, malaria, and microbial infections. For the past few decades, iron-chelating agents have been employed to enhance the quality of life for patients with iron accumulation conditions. This review attempts to express the importance of natural and artificial iron chelating agents, as well as the necessity of their extraction, production, and use in vital situations. It also provides a brief overview of the paths pursued by researchers in these fields to introduce suitable compounds as practical iron scavengers for entry into the pharmaceutical market.",

This study aimed to identify prognostic factors that can help make informed decisions regarding surgical resection in elderly patients with BM. We retrospectively included elderly patients (65 years or older) with newly diagnosed BM who underwent surgery. We conducted survival analyses and Cox regression analyses to identify potential independent predictors of poor survival. A total of 124 elderly patients with BM undergoing surgical resection were enrolled. In the multivariate analysis, male sex (HR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.22-3.13), ECM (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.82-4.85), BM in eloquent locations (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64), KPS deterioration (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.20-3.10), and mFI-5 equal to or greater than 2 (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.12-3.95) were associated with poor overall survival. Conversely, receiving systemic treatment after the diagnosis of BM showed a significant overall survival benefit (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28-0.70).

This report explored the precise role of USP28 on OSI resistance in NSCLC and identified a functional downstream effector. OSI-resistant H1975 cells (H1975/OSI) were established by long-term OSI exposure. USP28 and SIRT1 expression levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays included cell viability, colony formation, EdU incorporation, apoptosis analysis, and glycolysis assays. The interaction between USP28 and SIRT1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay and SIRT1 protein stability analysis. In vivo validation was performed using H1975/OSI xenograft models. USP28 and SIRT1 were upregulated in H1975/OSI cells and OSI-resistant NSCLC tissues. USP28 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation and glycolysis, suppressed apoptosis, and conferred OSI resistance in H1975 cells, while its depletion exerted opposite effects in H1975/OSI cells. Mechanistically, USP28 stabilized SIRT1 by deubiquitination. SIRT1 knockdown attenuated the effects of USP28 overexpression, while SIRT1 restoration reversed the phenotype alterations upon USP28 depletion. In vivo, USP28 depletion sensitized H1975/OSI xenografts to OSI treatment. Our study indicates that USP28 promotes OSI resistance in NSCLC by deubiquitinating SIRT1. Targeting the USP28/SIRT1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach to overcome OSI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

However, most published studies have used case-control designs, leading to selection bias. This study aimed to investigate the causal association between ESCC and GA using a nationwide cohort. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on consecutive participants who underwent endoscopy at 17 health check-up institutes in Japan between 2013 and 2017, with at least one follow-up endoscopy by December 2022. GA was evaluated endoscopically and classified into atrophy-free, closed-type, and open-type GA. The association between ESCC incidence and GA was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Among 33,461 participants, 17,398 (52.0%), 8257 (24.7%), and 7804 (23.3%) were classified into atrophy-free, closed-type GA, and open-type GA, respectively. Seventy-seven ESCCs were identified during a median 6-year follow-up period. The incidence of ESCC was 24 cases (0.024%/year) in the atrophy-free group, 15 cases (0.031%/year) in the closed-type GA group, and 38 cases (0.089%/year) in the open-type GA group, with a significantly higher incidence observed in the open-type GA group (p < 0.001). After adjusting for established risk factors (e.g., age, sex, drinking, and smoking), open-type GA, but not closed-type GA, was an independent risk factor for ESCC (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.58-4.69). This Japanese nationwide cohort study provides new evidence suggesting a causal association between extensive GA and the subsequent development of ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Oral delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics for cancer therapy encounters major challenges, such as gastrointestinal acidity, enzymatic degradation, mucus barriers, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. To address these challenges, this study engineers virus-like nanoparticles encapsulating siCENPN nucleic acid complexes and irradiated tumor cells (ITC), further coated with zwitterionic bacterial cellulose derivatives (PB-BC-BY). This innovative formulation demonstrates enhanced mucus penetration, improves stability in gastrointestinal environments, and effective inhibition of P-gp-mediated efflux. The nanoparticles effectively deliver siRNA into tumor cells, resulting in marked downregulation of CENPN expression and strong autophagy induction. The autophagic tumor cells and ITCs subsequently stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to secrete anti-tumor cytokines, thereby triggering an immune response. In vivo experiments confirm that orally administered nanoparticles successfully traverse the gastrointestinal barrier, enter systemic circulation, target tumors, and significantly inhibit tumor growth. Enhanced activation of dendritic cells, along with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Th1 cells in the tumor microenvironment, further confirms effective immune activation. Moreover, this treatment induces strong immune memory, prolonges survival, and provides substantial protection against tumor recurrence. This study presents a novel oral delivery strategy for nucleic acid therapeutics, offering an effective approach by simultaneously inducing tumor cell autophagy and promoting a robust immune-mediated anti-cancer response.",

In this investigation, we characterized SHR-2005, a second-generation CD40 agonistic mAb, as a potential candidate for cancer immune therapy. Our results showed that SHR-2005 possessed high affinity in binding to both human and rhesus CD40 and could effectively compete with CD40L for CD40 binding. Notably, SHR-2005 was engineered to exert a strong affinity for human FcγRIIb, consistent with its observed Fc receptor-dependent agonistic activity. Treatment with SHR-2005 led to robust activation of the CD40 signaling pathway and subsequent immune response. The murine surrogate SHR-2005-mIgG1 exhibited potent inhibition of tumor growth in the MC38 allograft model and showed enhanced antitumor efficacy in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, intravesical instillation of SHR-2005-mIgG1 also increased the populations of dendritic cells (DC), CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells in bladder tissue. No obvious abnormality except for a reversible local irritation was observed via intravesical instillation. Notably, SHR-2005 induced significantly lower IL-6 secretion than the APX005M analogue in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, the CD40 agonistic antibody SHR-2005 was highly reliant on FcγR for agonistic activation and exhibited promising potential for clinical development as monotherapy or in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of solid tumors. Based on promising efficacy and tolerance in preclinical studies, SHR-2005 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase I clinical trial for the intravesical treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are known to enhance the activity of enzymes, but such findings remain largely empirical, lacking predictive design principles. Here, the first high-throughput platform for the discovery of surface-engineered nanoparticles (SENs) that modulate enzyme function is introduced. Guided by the hypothesis that surface ligands are primary drivers of activity enhancement, a library of 194 gold- and palladium-based SENs functionalized with diverse peptide ligands is synthesized. These SENs are screened against three model enzymes: cytochrome c, lactoperoxidase (LPO), and lipase. Multiple SENs substantially increased enzymatic activity, with the most effective achieving ≈19-fold increase. The resulting dataset enabled the training of a machine learning model that identified key ligand features associated with high-performing SENs, establishing a predictive framework for designing activity-enhancing NPs. Mechanistic studies confirm that the ligand shell plays a dominant role in driving enhancement, suggesting that effective ligands identified via this approach can be readily transferred across NP platforms. To demonstrate functional relevance, it is shown that an optimized SEN/LPO pair outperforms LPO in inhibiting the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria and disrupting biofilm formation. Collectively, this work offers a scalable and generalizable method to map and harness nanoscale structure-function relationships at biointerfaces, with applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and beyond.",

These were withdrawn a median of 0.3 (IQR, 0.3-0.6) years after announcement of negative results. Two drugs had almost no payments after negative result announcement. Among other 4, average monthly payments in the year preceding announcement of negative results to the period between results and market withdrawal went from $138 to $183 for vinCRIStine sulfate, $12,317 to $4,606 for Panobinostat, $152,417 to $119,066 for belantamab mafodotin, and $23,139 to $13,588 for umbralisib. While payments for oncology drugs with accelerated approvals mostly decreased, industry promotion continued for certain drugs after confirmatory studies failed until drugs were withdrawn from market.",

    "abstract": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a safe and widely used technique for diagnosing mediastinal/hilar lesions. Recent studies showed that combining EBUS-TBNA with cryobiopsy (EBUS-transbronchial mediastinal cryobiopsy, EBUS-TMC) or forceps biopsy (EBUS-intranodal forceps biopsy, EBUS-IFB) enhances diagnostic accuracy by obtaining larger tissue samples. However, limited data is comparing the efficacy of EBUS-TMC and EBUS-IFB. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of these biopsy techniques in diagnosing mediastinal and hilar lesions. Patients with mediastinal/hilar lesions who underwent EBUS-TBNA and mediastinal biopsy from November 2022 to March 2024 were enrolled. Following needle aspiration, cryobiopsy and forceps biopsies were performed. The primary endpoint was diagnostic accuracy. A total of 219 mediastinal/hilar lesions were evaluated in 183 patients. EBUS-TMC demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than EBUS-IFB (95.4% vs. 84.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Subgroup analysis also showed superior yield rates for EBUS-TMC (96.1% vs. 89.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.027 in all malignancies; 96.1% vs. 86.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.042 in malignancies for re-biopsy; 95.2% vs. 76.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.040 in non-lung cancer malignancies; 93.8% vs. 73.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.002 in benign processes).

Adding EBUS-IFB did not improve accuracy when EBUS-TMC was already used with EBUS-TBNA. No severe complications leading to death or disability were observed. EBUS-TMC is an effective diagnostic and auxiliary method for mediastinal/hilar lesions, enhancing yield rates and tissue acquisition.",

    "title": "Navigating Liver Cancer with Mouse Models: A Comprehensive Overview of HCC Experimental Systems.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary hepatic malignancy and is globally the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic interventions, HCC prognosis remains poor due to asymptomatic progression, frequent recurrence, and inadequate treatment responsiveness. The development of HCC is closely linked to chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infections, alcoholic liver disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). To better understand hepatocarcinogenesis and support therapeutic development, a range of animal models have been established. Among these animal models, mice are extensively utilized because of their genetic manipulability, physiological resemblance to humans, and relatively short experimental timelines. The most well-established protocol for analyzing the onset and progression of HCC is the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model. Additionally, carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced HCC models, DEN+CCl₄ combination HCC models, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease HCC mouse models (STAM™), alcohol-associated HCC models, hydrodynamics-based transfection (HBT) systems, and orthotopic HCC transplantation approaches also provide distinct advantages for exploring specific elements of HCC pathophysiology. Unfortunately, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of human HCC, no single animal model can accurately recapitulate the disease. Therefore, careful selection or combination of appropriate mouse models for specific research objectives is crucial to enhance the translational value of preclinical studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mouse models currently employed in HCC research, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Such understanding and application of these HCC models are essential for advancing mechanistic insights and fostering the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "High-Z materials enhance radiation dose deposition primarily through strong photoelectric absorption. Leveraging this property, nanoparticles based on high-Z content materials can be utilized as nanoscale radiosensitizers to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. Notably, gold nanoparticles (Au: gold, AuNPs) have been intensively investigated due to their excellent radiosensitizing effect and straightforward synthesis process. However, without additional modifications, they suffer from unfavorable biodistribution and inefficient tumor targeting, which limit their efficacy as radiosensitizers. Herein, we developed ultrasmall AuNPs encapsulated in PEGylated liposome (PEG: polyethylene glycol, Au-Lipo) and optimized their PEGylated lipid composition to improve their performance as radiosensitizers. Au-Lipo formulation was synthesized and optimized to exhibit good stability and cellular uptake <i>in vitro</i>. Au-Lipo demonstrated a dose enhancement factor at 2 Gy (DEF<sub>2Gy</sub>) of 2.56 which tends to have higher value compared to the commercial AuNPs, AuroVist. Furthermore, Au-Lipo showed substantial tumor uptake in positron emission tomography with significantly improved tumor therapeutic efficacy compared to radiotherapy alone in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (<i>P</i> = 0.035). These results suggest that Au-Lipo is a promising radiosensitizing agent, offering systemic injectability, enhanced tumor-targeting efficiency, and significant therapeutic potential for improving radiotherapy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a distinct molecular subtype of gastric cancer with EBV latency infection. EBV microRNAs, especially rightward transcript (BART) microRNAs, play key roles in the tumor growth of EBVaGC. However, the effects of EBV-miR-BART19-3p in EBVaGC remain largely unknown. EBV-miR-BART19-3p was detected by qRT-PCR in EBER in situ hybridization positive gastric carcinoma tissues. CCK8, Colony formation, EdU and Flow cytometry were conducted in gastric cancer cells with overexpression and knockdown of EBV-miR-BART19-3p compared to the negative control, respectively. Tumor xenografts were conducted in vivo. GADD45B was screened by RNA sequencing and dual-luciferase reporter assays implemented with transfecting EBV-miR-BART19-3p antagomir. Proteins were confirmed by Western blotting. EBV-miR-BART19-3p was highly expressed in EBVaGC and promoted the proliferation of EBV-associated gastric cancer cells in vitro and accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of EBV-miR-BART19-3p induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in AGS EBV cells. Molecularly, EBV-miR-BART19-3p directly targets the 3'-UTR of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducing protein Beta (GADD45B) mRNA and downregulates its protein expression, which consequently reduced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest. Reconstitution of GADD45B can rescue the proliferation phenotype caused by EBV-miR-BART19-3p in EBVaGC cells. Our study indicated Epstein-Barr Virus MicroRNA BART19-3p played an oncogenic role by a novel mechanism of inhibiting GADD45B in EBVaGC, which provides new insights and might be a potential therapeutic strategy for EBVaGC patients.",

This study aimed to compare mpMRI and bpMRI in detecting csPCa across prostate-specific antigen (PSA) strata and identify supplementary tools comparable to dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Images were evaluated using mpMRI-based mp-PI-RADS and bpMRI-based bp-PI-RADS and simplified PI-RADS (S-PI-RADS) schemes. The lesion volume (LV) was manually segmented by a radiologist using ITK-SNAP software on high b-value DWI images. The diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The differences of T2WI-score, DCE assessment and LV between csPCa and non-csPCa in peripheral zone (PZ) with DWI category 3 were compared. For overall PSA, mp-PI-RADS and bp-PI-RADS showed comparable AUCs (0.889 vs. 0.882; P > 0.05). When PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, mp-PI-RADS exhibited the highest specificity (91.0% vs. bp-PI-RADS: 64.4%, S-PI-RADS: 75.0%) and PPV (73.0% vs. bp-PI-RADS: 47.7%, S-PI-RADS: 52.5%). When PSA > 10 ng/ml, S-PI-RADS demonstrated higher sensitivity (91.6% vs. mp-PI-RADS: 83.2%, bp-PI-RADS: 81.2%) and F1-score (0.873 [0.822-0.924] vs. mp-PI-RADS: 0.832 [0.778-0.886], bp-PI-RADS: 0.831 [0.777-0.885]). Among DWI category 3 PZ lesions, neither DCE nor T2WI significantly stratified csPCa risk (P = 0.657 and P = 0.424), whereas LV ≥ 0.5 cm³ showed markedly higher csPCa risk (83.8% vs. 45.8%; P < 0.001). While mpMRI and bpMRI exhibit comparable overall diagnostic performance but context-dependent strengths: mpMRI demonstrates higher specificity for avoiding unnecessary biopsies when PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, whereas bpMRI (particularly S-PI-RADS) maximizes sensitivity for csPCa detection when PSA > 10 ng/ml.

Despite its significant public health impact, molecular epidemiological data on EBV in Saudi Arabia, especially its southwestern region, are scarce. This study aims to characterize EBV epidemiology and clinical correlations using reference laboratory data from Southwestern Saudi Arabia collected between 2020 and 2023, while identifying associated demographic and clinical factors. This retrospective study was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed EBV cases, and Ethical Approval was obtained. Descriptive statistics, χ [2] tests, and multivariate regression were employed to analyze demographic and clinical data from 133 EBV-positive patients. These analyses aimed to identify associations with age, gender, nationality, year of diagnosis, and clinical presentation, considering results statistically significant at p < 0.05. The overall EBV prevalence was 17.5% (133/760). Temporal analysis indicated an increase in cases from 2020 to 2022, followed by a remarkable decrease in 2023 (13.5%, p = 0.01), likely attributable to post-COVID-19 shifts in healthcare practices. Furthermore, seasonal patterns displayed a bimodal distribution, peaking in the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quarters. Saudi nationals comprised n = 103 (77.4%) of positive cases with the highest burden among children, with n = 101 (76%) of cases occurring in children under 12 years (toddlers 1-5 years: n = 57, 42.9%; children 6-12 years: n = 44, 33.1%). Infectious diseases (n = 38, 28.6%) and hematological disorders (n = 27, 20.3%) were the most common clinical associations. A correlation was found between clinical diagnosis and both gender (p = 0.04) and age group (p = 0.001). Finally, age (β = -0.411, p = 0.029) and test date (β = -0.187, p = 0.03) were significant negative predictors of EBV infection. This study establishes the first molecular-based epidemiological analysis of EBV infection in Southwestern Saudi Arabia, revealing distinct demographic and clinical patterns, with predominant pediatric involvement and strong age-related associations. The observed temporal fluctuations, including pandemic-related changes, emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance. These findings indicate the importance of pediatric-focused monitoring, region-specific diagnostic protocols, and further research into ethnic disparities, coinfections, and long-term clinical outcomes. The key limitations of this study include its retrospective design, the absence of systematic evaluation of coinfections (including COVID-19), and the use of data from a single region. To understand the burden of this virus at the national level, further national studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who are resistant to at least both rifampicin and isoniazid, lack effective treatment options in clinic. The gold standard for the diagnosis of MDR-TB is drug sensitivity test, which is time-consuming and has a relatively low positive detection rate. Screening early diagnostic biomarker for MDR-TB is urgent need in clinical practice. A total of 33 patients with MDR-TB, healthy controls and drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) were included in this study. Total plasma exosomal RNA was extracted from the subjects, and the MDR-TB plasma-specific exosomal miRNAs were obtained by Illumina sequencing. There were 644 and 647 differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma exosomes of MDR-TB patients obtained by sequencing and biogenic analysis compared with DS-TB patients and healthy controls, respectively. Differential miRNAs are mainly involved in the biological function of regulation of transcription and protein binding, and enriched in the pathways in cancer and MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, seven plasma exosomal miRNAs in MDR-TB patients were significantly different from those in DS-TB patients and healthy controls. Among them, three of the miRNAs (hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1, hsa-miR-23b-3p_R + 1, and hsa-miR-15a-5p_R-1) were found to be in target relationship with MDR-TB related genes (NTRK2, KIDINS220, NCKAP1, MAPK9, NFAT5, ATF6 and SLC11A2) by target gene prediction analysis. Further the bioinformatic analysis showed that hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1 targets the protein PGLYRP2, a diagnostic biomarker identified in our previous study. We suggest that hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1, hsa-miR-23b-3p_R + 1, and hsa-miR-15a-5p_R-1 are closely related to MDR-TB.",

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic data indicate that aberrant tRNA modifications in malignant diseases can promote tumor growth by facilitating oncogene translation. NSUN2, a 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase of tRNA, is elevated in an array of solid cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, it remains unclear how NSUN2 drives aggressive behavior and if NSUN2 could be an effective therapeutic target for TNBC. Functional experiments, including RNA interference, lentivirus transduction, and in vivo xenograft models, were conducted to evaluate the role of NSUN2 in TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Ribosome sequencing (Ribo-seq), tRNA m5C bisulfite sequencing, and codon usage bias analysis were employed to explore the translational mechanisms underlying NSUN2-mediated tRNA modifications. Glycolysis assays and molecular docking were used to investigate metabolic reprogramming and protein interactions. NSUN2 was significantly upregulated in TNBC and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 mediates m5C modification of tRNA<sup>Val-CAC</sup>, enhancing the codon-frequency-dependent translation of key glycolysis-related genes, including ALDH3A2, ALDH7A1, HK1, and PFKM. Depletion of NSUN2 disrupted tRNA<sup>Val-CAC</sup> m5C modification, impairing the translation of these metabolic enzymes and suppressing glycolysis, which ultimately inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, NSUN2 overexpression conferred resistance to docetaxel, while its inhibition sensitized TNBC cells to docetaxel treatment. Clinically, elevated expression levels of NSUN2 and glycolysis-related genes were observed in docetaxel-resistant TNBC tissues, further supporting the role of NSUN2 in chemoresistance. This study identifies NSUN2 as a critical regulator of TNBC progression through tRNA<sup>Val-CAC</sup> m5C modification and codon-biased translation of glycolysis-related mRNAs. Our findings reveal a novel NSUN2-tRNA<sup>Val-CAC</sup> axis that orchestrates metabolic reprogramming and translational control in TNBC, offering a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

We investigated MSR expression in response to a variety of stress conditions by using small molecule compounds. We identified the isoflavone genistein to selectively stimulate MSR transcription, but not that of other DNA repeat elements. Genistein is a natural compound that is frequently used in dietary supplements and has been associated with reducing cancer risk. A 24 h exposure of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to genistein results in a more than 100-fold induction of MSR transcripts. This up-regulation depends on the activity of RNA polymerase II and requires a cycling G1 cell population. Blocking the cell cycle at the G2/M stage significantly attenuates genistein-mediated stimulation of MSR transcription. Mechanistically, DNA topoisomerase poisons phenocopy the genistein-dependent up-regulation of MSR expression. Together, these data suggest that MSR transcriptional response is guided by an altered topology of the underlying A/T-rich MSR DNA repeat arrays and reveal a novel function for genistein that may contribute to the anticancer properties of this natural compound.",

To clarify the electronic, thermochemical, and structural properties of drug (ME) complexes with Mg<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub> nanocages, DFT calculations were combined with the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) study. NBO analysis revealed that the maximum stability energy of the electronic transfer of ME into Mg<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub> nanocavities originated from the LP(1)N27 to LP*(1)Mg5 transition with an E2 value of 17.63 kcal mol. Further, the maximum stability energy value obtained from Mg<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub> nanocages to the drug ME was owing to the electronic shift from LP*(1) Mg 5 to σ*C 31-H 41 orbitals compared to the drug/nanotube complex with E2 = 0.81 kcal.mol-1. Based on the QTAIM results, -G(r)/V(r) value ​​for the interaction between the H41 atom of the ME drug and the O13 atom of the nanocage [(C31-H41 (ME)…O13 (nanocage)] was about 0.37, indicating the covalent nature of the interaction.

This retrospective study analyzed 27 patients with aGBM (solid enhancement without visible necrosis) and 105 patients with PCNSL, all undergoing preoperative DWI, DCE-MRI, and CA preload DSC-PWI. The relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were obtained from DWI and DSC-PWI.

A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the combined effect of various parameters. Before regression analysis, collinearity analysis of parameters was performed. The diagnostic capability of each parameter and their combination were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC) and compared with DeLong test. In comparison to aGBM, the Ktrans, Ve, and iAUC were significantly elevated in PCNSL, whereas the rCBV and rADC were significantly lower (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

    "abstract": "Double Homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a potent transcription factor encoded by a retrogene mapped in D4Z4 repeated elements on chromosome 4q35. DUX4 has emerged as pivotal in the pathomechanisms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a relatively common hereditary muscle wasting condition, although classified as a rare disease. DUX4 contributes to zygote genome activation before its expression is repressed in most somatic tissues through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. In FSHD, inappropriate activation of DUX4 expression is driven by a complex interplay of genomic and epigenetic alterations. The ectopic presence of DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells activates genes, viral elements and pathways that are typical of very early embryonic development, disturbing cell function and ultimately contributing to muscle weakness and wasting. This review first traces the history of DUX4, from the FSHD genetic linkage studies in the early 1990s, through to identification and characterization of the DUX4 gene in 1999. We then discuss the seminal studies that showed how and why DUX4 is expressed in FSHD and the effects of this ectopic expression in muscle, notably cellular toxicity. Other pathological roles of DUX4, such as participation in cancer and viral infection, are also highlighted. Maintenance of DUX4 in the genome was explained by discovery of the function of DUX4 in zygotic genome activation to institute the totipotent cells of the embryo. Thus, we encompass the gradual transition of DUX4 over the past 25 years from being considered a pseudogene in \"junk DNA\" to becoming central to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of FSHD and the primary focus for FSHD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "With rapid advancements in single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), various computational methods have been developed to study evolution and call variants on single-cell level. However, modeling deletions remains challenging because they affect total coverage in ways that are difficult to distinguish from technical artifacts. We present DelSIEVE, a statistical method that infers cell phylogeny and single-nucleotide variants, accounting for deletions, from scDNA-seq data. DelSIEVE distinguishes deletions from mutations and artifacts, detecting more evolutionary events than previous methods. Simulations show high performance, and application to cancer samples reveals varying amounts of deletions and double mutants in different tumors.",

    "title": "Senescent fibroblasts secrete CTHRC1 to promote cancer stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Cellular senescence plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Substantial evidence indicates that senescence occurs in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal component within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which profoundly impacts tumor biology. However, despite growing evidence of stromal cell involvement in cancer progression, the specific mechanisms and clinical implications of senescent CAFs (SCAFs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been fully elucidated. The senescence signature was utilized to evaluate the senescence status of cell types within the TME of HCC using the GSE149614 dataset. The CytoTRACE and cell-cell communication analysis were used to find the correlation between cancer stemness and SCAFs. A risk prediction model associated with SCAFs was constructed to investigate potential mechanisms by which SCAFs promote tumor progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing data was used to identify senescent CAF-related genes. Gene expression and clinical data for HCC were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) databases. Using four machine-learning algorithms, crucial genes were identified to develop a CAF-senescence-related risk model, predicting prognosis, cancer stemness, immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and therapeutic responses in HCC patients. Next, we explored the role of Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing-1 (CTHRC1) in cancer stemness using both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Through various functional experiments, we elucidated the downstream signaling pathways of CTHRC1. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were used to verify that key transcription factors bind to the CTHRC1 promoter region. CAFs exhibited high senescence status and a strong correlation with cancer stemness in HCC. A novel CAF-senescence-score (CSscore) prognostic model was established for HCC based on 10 genes: CTHRC1, SERPINE1, RNF11, ENG, MARCKSL1, ASAP1, FHL3, LAMB1, CD151, and OLFML2B. The survival prediction performance was validated on TCGA, ICGC, and NODE cohorts. Immune analysis revealed that the CSscore was positively correlated with immunosuppressive immune cell populations, including M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between the CSscore and anti-tumor immune cells such as CD8 + T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells HCC patients with a low CSscore had a lower tumor mutation burden and showed improved responsiveness to immunotherapy and transarterial chemoembolization. In vitro experiments and bioinformatics analysis further revealed that CTHRC1 was significantly elevated in SCAFs promoted cancer stemness and metastasis via the SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4)-CTHRC1-Notch1 axis in HCC. Our study revealed that SCAFs were strongly correlated with cancer stemness in HCC. A novel machine learning model based on senescent CAF-related genes was constructed to accurately predict prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, CTHRC1 was identified as a novel prognostic and therapeutic biomarker to predict poor prognosis in HCC and promote cancer stemness and metastasis through the Notch signaling pathway, with its expression being transcriptionally regulated by SOX4.",

Tumor heterogeneity manifests not only among different patients but also within individual tumors, further complicating personalized treatment approaches. Single-cell sequencing technologies encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and spatial omics have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect tumor heterogeneity at single-cell resolution with multi-layered depth. These approaches have illuminated tumor biology, immune escape mechanisms, treatment resistance, and patient-specific immune response mechanisms, thereby substantially advancing precision oncology strategies. This review systematically examines recent advances in single-cell multi-omics technologies across various cancer research areas, emphasizing their transformative impacts on understanding tumor heterogeneity, immunotherapy, minimal residual disease monitoring, and neoantigen discovery. Additionally, we discuss current technical and analytical limitations and unresolved questions associated with single-cell technologies.

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the urinary exosomal proteome of SCLC patients to identify and validate potential non-invasive biomarkers for improving diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and prognosis prediction. We analyzed 90 urine samples from SCLC patients, divided into training (n = 38) and validation (n = 52) sets, including untreated, partial/complete remission, and relapsed groups. Ten healthy controls were included. Urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The proteomic analysis employed data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Immunohistochemistry was performed on 30 pairs of SCLC and adjacent normal tissues. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct exosomal protein expression patterns across SCLC stages. RAB11A emerged as a key differentially expressed protein. PRM validation confirmed significant changes in RAB11A levels across disease stages. ROC curve analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of RAB11A in distinguishing SCLC patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, P = 0.0004), with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 92%. RAB11A also showed significant potential in monitoring treatment response (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, P = 0.0019) and disease relapse (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.00, P = 0.0005). Immunohistochemistry showed significantly higher RAB11A expression in SCLC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (70% vs. 33% positive expression, P = 0.043). Urinary exosomal RAB11A shows promise as a non-invasive biomarker for SCLC diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and early detection of relapse, potentially improving clinical management of SCLC patients. The findings provide insights into SCLC pathogenesis and offer a non-invasive approach for patient monitoring, which could improve clinical management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen, or N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP), causes severe liver damage and acute liver failure when overdosed. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can regulate the function of macrophages, which play an important role in drug-induced liver injury. It is unclear whether CpG ODN-treated macrophages play an immune regulation role in APAP-induced liver injury. In the present study, we aim to explore the role of CpG ODN-activated macrophages in APAP-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanism in protecting against the cytotoxicity of APAP. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were treated with APAP (300 mg/Kg) or/and CpG ODN (ODN 1826, 1.65 mg/Kg) by intraperitoneal injection, then survival rate, histopathological evaluation, and inflammatory factors were observed to ascertain the protective effect of CpG ODN. Then, CpG ODN-treated macrophages were reinfused into the animal model to determine the effector cells. In vitro, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics detection were performed to illustrate the underlying mechanism. Last, Acod1 siRNA interference was used to clarify the role of IRG1 in resistance to APAP cytotoxicity by ROS and apoptosis indicator detections. We found that CpG ODN showed a protective effect against APAP cytotoxicity by stimulating macrophages rather than hepatic parenchymal cells. In particular, reinfusion of CpG ODN-treated macrophages to mice can alleviate APAP-induced liver injury. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that the expression of aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1; also known as immune responsive gene 1, IRG1) and the metabolite itaconate generated by IRG1 catalysis increased after CpG ODN stimulation. In addition, we found that the mechanism of this protective effect is ascribed to the increased expression of Acod1 and the antioxidative function of itaconate by the activation of the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway. CpG ODN alleviated liver injury induced by APAP through the activation of the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages, upregulating the expression of IRG1 protein, promoting the production of endogenous metabolite itaconate, and inhibiting macrophage apoptosis which was regulated by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 to inhibit ROS production. This study sheds new light on CpG ODN as a therapeutic strategy in resistance to APAP-induced liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a leading global cause of death, with complex pathogenesis and treatment challenges like poor selectivity, toxicity, and drug resistance. Nanotechnology offers transformative solutions, with plant-derived exosomes (EXOs) emerging as promising green nanomaterials for personalized cancer therapy because of their biocompatibility and minimal antigenicity, and eco-friendly production. This review discusses the potential of plant EXOs in cancer treatment, covering isolation methods, advantages over mammalian EXOs (e.g., stability, cost-effectiveness, and evasion of drug resistance mechanisms), and preclinical applications. For instance, ginger EXOs suppress colorectal cancer via cytokine modulation, grapefruit EXOs target brain tumors, and lemon EXOs induce apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer. Plant EXOs also enhance drug delivery when loaded with chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids, or immunomodulators, improving precision and reducing off-target effects. Despite their promise, challenges remain in scalability, purity, long-term safety for non-oral routes, and clinical translation. Future research must optimize isolation techniques, clarify molecular mechanisms, and validate pharmacokinetics to advance clinical adoption. This review offers a complete examination of plant EXOs, including biogenesis, characterization, engineering strategies, anti-cancer mechanisms (e.g., apoptosis induction, immune modulation), and therapeutic applications. It also addresses hurdles like standardization and regulatory gaps while advocating interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge lab-to-clinic gaps. By harnessing plant EXOs' potential, this work highlights a path toward sustainable, targeted cancer therapies, urging further innovation to overcome existing barriers and realize their full clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common and malignant tumor in the field of neurosurgery. Natural chemotherapeutic agents are an appealing option due to their diverse activities and low cost. Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, holds great potential for treating resistant cancers. The specific mechanism by which 4'-hydroxychalcone extracted from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. induces glioma cell death remains unclear. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of 4'-hydroxychalcone's effect on glioma cells. Through CCK-8 assay, cell scratch and invasion assay, q-PCR technology, WB detection and immunofluorescence, the inhibitory effect of 4'-hydroxychalcone on glioma and its mechanism were analyzed. The study found that 20 μM 4'-hydroxychalcone could induce ferroptosis and inhibit the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of glioma cells. Subsequent analysis revealed that this process of ferroptosis was triggered through the xCT/GSH/GPX4 axis, which was regulated by the AKT/mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway. Similar tumor inhibitory effects to the clinical drug temozolomide were also observed in the in vivo tumor model. Long-term animal toxicity experiments showed that high doses of 4'-hydroxychalcone (100 mg/kg) did not cause damage to the organs of the animals. This study provides new insights into tumor ferroptosis research and traditional Chinese medicine-based treatment of GBM.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is relatively common in patients diagnosed with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC); however, the impact of BCa history on UTUC prognoses after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is unclear. This retrospective, multicenter cohort study aimed to assess this relationship and improve clinical decision making. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of propensity score-matched (PSM) data from two Chinese centers and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were categorized into three groups: BCa-UTUC (defined as patients with a BCa history or BCa occurring within 3 months following RNU); UTUC-BCa (defined as patients who had BCa for 3 months or more following RNU); or solely UTUC (defined as patients with no BCa). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare survival differences, and Cox's regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Overall, 7249 cases were included (1010 from China, 6239 from the SEER database). PSM ensured well-balanced baseline characteristics. In the Chinese cohort, BCa-UTUC cases had significantly poorer CSS than solely UTUC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.334, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.547-3.523; p < 0.001). UTUC-BCa also had worse CSS (HR 1.697, 95% CI 1.178-2.446; p = 0.005). BCa-UTUC was associated with worse OS (HR 2.404, 95% CI 1.703-3.393; p < 0.001). SEER findings were consistent, with both BCa-UTUC and UTUC-BCa linked to adverse CSS.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is tightly linked to metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion. However, the transcriptional networks driving these processes remain misunderstood. Here, we identified a novel regulatory axis wherein the transcription factor SOX4 formed a stress-responsive complex with NRF2, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. This process was orchestrated via p62-mediated disruption of the KEAP1-SOX4 complex. The SOX4-NRF2 complex directly activated Phosphoserine Phosphatase (PSPH) transcription-as revealed by luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation-enhancing serine biosynthesis and downstream metabolites critical for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and redox balance. Inhibition of SOX4 or NRF2 impaired PSPH expression, exacerbated oxidative damage-marked by elevated 4-hydroxynonenal-and increased sensitivity to sorafenib treatment in HCC cells. Furthermore, PSPH-driven metabolites, particularly serine, fostered M2-like macrophage polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the promotion of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Analysis of HCC specimens from TCGA and clinical cohorts confirmed that high SOX4/NRF2/PSPH expression was correlated with increasing M2 macrophage infiltration and poor patient prognosis. Our findings revealed a previously unrecognized SOX4-NRF2-PSPH regulatory loop that coupled cancer metabolism with immune modulation. Targeting this axis may offer a promising therapeutic avenue to simultaneously disrupt metabolic support and immune evasion in HCC.",

Hitherto, little has been known regarding the clinical implications of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and its biological mechanisms of antitumor effect on treatment-naïve ESCC.

By characterizing the immune infiltration and genomic profiles based on transcriptomic datasets, we found TLS abundant in enriched B cells with IRF4 as a signature gene. Increased expression of IRF4 and its positive correlation with STING in activating tumor-infiltrating B cells were also investigated using a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. CD40 as a co-regulator of IRF4 and TLS formation, in vitro experiments were conducted to further demonstrate the competitive binding relationships between CD40 and STING with TRAF2 in promoting IRF4 expression and B cell activation via the non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathway, in which CD40 reduced STING ubiquitination while promoting its phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of B-cell malignancies; however, its efficacy can be limited by poor T-cell persistence and insufficient antitumor activity in certain cases. Moreover, interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a prominent agent in cancer immunotherapy, but its clinical application is constrained by severe toxicity associated with systemic exposure. In this study, we developed a novel cytokine delivery platform based on CAR target-modified cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that preferentially bind CAR-T cells to improve CAR-T-cell function. EVs with surface-displayed CD19 and/or IL-12 were successfully generated from HEK-293T cells. Compared with an equivalent concentration of rhIL-12, IL-12 EVs significantly enhanced the effector function of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in vitro, resulting in increased Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and TNF-α secretion, cytolytic activity, and T-cell expansion. Additionally, compared with EVs expressing IL-12 alone, EVs co-expressing IL-12 and CD19 (CD19/IL-12 EVs) exhibited superior binding efficiency to CAR-T cells but not to T cells, as indicated by flow cytometry. In xenograft model mice bearing CD19 + Raji tumors, intratumoral injection of CD19/IL-12 EVs resulted in durable antitumor responses and enhanced the in vivo expansion of CAR-T cells, outperforming CD19 EVs, IL-12 EVs and control EVs, without causing systemic toxicity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of CAR-T cells stimulated with EVs suggested that the increased efficacy was driven by IL-12 signaling. These data demonstrate that CAR-targeted modified EVs may serve as targeted cytokine delivery systems for CAR-T cells, offering a safe and effective strategy to augment CAR-T-cell function.",

This study aimed to establish a comprehensive multi-omics framework to elucidate Piper longum's anti-cancer mechanisms. We integrated in vivo experiments, metabolomics, gut microbiota analysis, mass spectrometry, and network pharmacology to investigate Piper longum's effects. In vivo studies assessed its dose-dependent inhibition of GC growth compared to standard chemotherapy (L-OHP + 5-FU). Metabolomics identified altered lipid metabolism pathways, while gut microbiota analysis evaluated its impact on microbial composition. Piperine was identified as the key active compound, and ACOT1 was pinpointed as a critical molecular target through integrated analysis. Piper longum significantly suppressed gastric cancer (GC) growth in a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose treatment demonstrating superior efficacy compared to conventional chemotherapy (L-OHP + 5-FU). Metabolomic analysis revealed that its anti-cancer mechanism primarily involves the reprogramming of lipid metabolism pathways in GC cells, while gut microbiota assessment confirmed that it modulates intestinal flora composition without compromising microbial diversity, supporting its favorable safety profile. Mass spectrometry identified piperine as the key bioactive compound, and integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology further pinpointed ACOT1 as a critical molecular target, which interacts with piperine that confirmed by CETSA. Notably, high ACOT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in GC patients, underscoring its therapeutic relevance. This study elucidates Piper longum's \"component-target-pathway\" mechanism in GC treatment, highlighting piperine-ACOT1-de novo lipogenesis regulatory pathway as a critical axis.

    "abstract": "Single base substitution (SBS) mutations, particularly C > T and T > C, are increased owing to unrepaired DNA replication errors in mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) cancers. Excess CpG > TpG mutations have been reported in MMRd cancers defective in mismatch detection (dMutSα), but not in mismatch correction (dMutLα). Somatic CpG > TpG mutations conventionally result from unrepaired spontaneous deamination of 5'-methylcytosine throughout the cell cycle, causing T:G mismatches and signature SBS1. It has been proposed that MutSα detects those mismatches, prior to error correction by base excision repair (BER). However, other evidence appears inconsistent with that hypothesis: for example, MutSα is specifically expressed in S/G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle, and defects in replicative DNA polymerase proofreading specifically cause excess CpG > TpG mutations in signature SBS10b. We analysed mutation spectra and COSMIC mutation signatures in whole-genome sequencing data from 1803 colorectal cancers (164 dMutLα, 20 dMutSα) and 596 endometrial cancers (103 dMutLα, 9 dMutSα) from the UK 100,000 Genomes Project. We mapped each C > T mutation to its genomic features, including normal DNA methylation state, replication timing, transcription strand, and replication strand, to investigate the mechanism(s) by which these mutations arise. We confirmed that dMutSα tumours specifically had higher CpG > TpG burdens than dMutLα tumours. We could fully reconstitute the observed dMutSα CpG > TpG mutation spectrum by adding CpG > TpG mutations in proportion to their SBS1 activity to the dMutLα spectrum. However, other evidence indicated that the SBS1 excess in dMutSα cancers did not come from 5'-methylcytosine deamination alone: non-CpG C > T mutations were also increased in dMutSα cancers; and, in contrast to tumours deficient in BER, CpG > TpG mutations were biased to the leading DNA replication strand, at similar levels in dMutSα and dMutLα cancers, suggesting an origin in DNA replication. Other substitution mutations usually corrected by BER were not increased in dMutSα tumours. There is a CpG > TpG and SBS1 excess specific to dMutSα MMRd tumours, consistent with previous reports, and we find a general increase in somatic C > T mutations. Contrary to some other studies, the similar leading replication strand bias in both dMutSα and dMutLα tumours indicates that at least some of the excess CpG > TpG mutations arise via DNA replication errors, and not primarily via the replication-independent deamination of 5'-methylcytosine.",

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) offers a non-invasive, deep-penetrating approach by using ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers and generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Yet poor intratumoral delivery and low ROS quantum yields of existing agents have stalled clinical translation. Here, we present a synergistic SDT platform that overcomes these barriers by combining transient vasodilation of tumor microvessels with the clinically widely used Antianginal drug isosorbide mononitrate and an acceptor-donor-acceptor-donor-acceptor type organic nanosonosensitizer (BTz) engineered for a narrow bandgap and enhanced ultrasound responsiveness. Isosorbide mononitrate increases nanosonosensitizer accumulation by ~ 1.8-fold. Under ultrasound irradiation, nanosonosensitizer produced high ROS generation, resulting in 78% tumor growth inhibition in murine HCC models-nearly double that of SDT alone-without detectable systemic toxicity. Crucially, the near-infrared fluorescence of nanosonosensitizer enabled real-time, image-guided tracking of sonosensitizer uptake and therapeutic response. By repurposing a safe vasodilator and integrating it with a high-performance organic sonosensitizer, this work establishes a readily translatable, minimally invasive paradigm for precise SDT of localized, inoperable or metastatic HCC.",

The absence of reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to accurately identify high-risk patients further complicates the clinical management of the disease. MOC-31, an antibody that targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), is utilized to distinguish between mesothelioma and metastatic cancer, but its clinical utility, prognostic value and functional dynamics in bladder cancer have yet to be verified. A comprehensive analysis of EpCAM expression and its associations with key clinicopathological parameters was performed via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, we retrospectively assessed EpCAM expression in our bladder cancer cohort using MOC-31 antibody and examined its prognostic value and correlation with clinicopathological features. The cBioPortal, STRING and TIMER databases were used to explore the interactions between EpCAM expression, immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes. The difference in EpCAM expression varied widely across various cancer types and was strongly correlated with advanced cancer stage. EpCAM staining with MOC-31 exhibited membranous positivity in 51.7% of the analysed cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a discernible trend suggesting a poorer prognosis for patients with low EpCAM expression than for those with high EpCAM expression. Protein-protein interaction demonstrated that EFGR, HER2 and Claudin-7 are key EpCAM interactors. A strong association was observed between EpCAM expression and immune cell infiltration as well as immune-related genes. This study highlights the prognostic value of EpCAM in bladder cancer, revealing a strong link between EpCAM expression and disease pathogenesis. These results underscore the need for further research to validate these findings and explore the significance of EpCAM as a therapeutic target in managing bladder cancer.",

This study introduces a novel approach that integrates single-cell sequencing with deep learning (DL), which enables the identification of tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells without neoantigen screening. The T Cell Receptor Engineered T (TCR-T) cell tumor organoid killing model was employed to validate the functionality of DL-identified TR CD8 + T cells, while spatial transcriptomics was used to confirm receptor-ligand interactions involving TR CD8 + TILs. Comprehensive analyses of TR CD8 + TILs revealed impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain-related pathways regulated by the transcription factor FOS. The TIGIT-NECTIN2 axis was identified as an important immune checkpoint molecule in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis demonstrated that some TR CD8 + TILs possess multiple TCR αβ combinations. Furthermore, TCR-T targeting experiments using tumor organoids revealed that combinations of multiple distinct TR TCRs exhibit significantly superior tumor-killing capabilities compared to a single type TCR. Clinically, a higher proportion of TR CD8 + TILs was positively associated with improved responses to neoadjuvant immunotherapy and longer overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients. This study represents a significant advancement in the understanding of TR TIL biology and provides a rapid and accurate method to identify TR CD8 TILs.",

    "abstract": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a heterogeneous disease with variable outcomes, necessitating practical classification systems. Molecular subtyping using immunohistochemical (IHC) markers offers a cost-effective approach for therapeutic guidance and assessing survival. Moreover, MIBC molecular subclassification provides a practical approach for guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We evaluated 124 MIBC cases using IHC markers GATA3, CK5/6, and p16. Cases were classified as luminal (GATA3+, CK5/6-), basal (GATA3-, CK5/6+), or other (GATA3-, CK5/6-). Luminal cases were further subdivided into luminal unstable (LumU; p16+) and luminal papillary (LumP; p16-). Clinicopathological characteristics of MIBC molecular subtypes were also assessed. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were evaluated relative to clinicopathological features and MIBC subtypes. In our study, 36.2% of the cases were LumU, 27.6% LumP, and 24.8% basal. The basal subtype generally shows a significantly higher tumor stage (p < 0.05). PD-1 was expressed in 70.5% of cases, with the highest expression in LumU (84.21%). PD-1 expression was significantly higher in the luminal compared to the basal subtype (82.1% vs. 53.8%, p < 0.01). PD-L1, expressed in 40% of cases, was significantly elevated in stage III and considerably higher in basal than luminal subtype (57.7% vs. 34.3%, p < 0.05). MIBCs were practically subclassified into LumU, LumP, basal, and other subtypes using three IHC markers. PD-1 expression was higher in the luminal subtype, while PD-L1 was predominantly elevated in the basal subtype. These findings highlight the potential of IHC-based subtyping to guide prognosis and treatment in MIBCs.",

    "title": "Comparative impact of social isolation on mortality in adults aged 40 years and above with versus without metabolic syndrome: evidence from two large cohorts in the U.S. and U.K.",
    "abstract": "Social isolation is increasingly recognized as a significant public health concern associated with mortality risk. However, whether the impact of social isolation on mortality differs between individuals with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of social isolation with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CVDM), cancer mortality (CAM), other cause mortality (OTM), and premature mortality in MetS and non-MetS populations using data from large cohorts in the UK and the US. This study analyzed data from 75,190 participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 229,388 participants without MetS in the UK Biobank, as well as 5758 MetS participants and 7448 non-MetS participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants included in the study were aged 40 years or above. The identification of MetS was based on a comprehensive assessment of multiple biochemical indicators, including waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels. Social isolation was evaluated using information on marital status, household size, frequency of contact with family and friends, and engagement in social activities. The primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, other-cause mortality, and premature mortality, defined as death before the age of 70. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between social isolation and various mortality outcomes. In addition, interaction and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the potential modifying effects of MetS status, as well as lifestyle and other risk factors, on the relationship between social isolation and mortality. In the UK Biobank, the rates of all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality among participants with MetS were 9.07%, 1.48%, 4.22%, 3.36%, and 1.98%, respectively; the corresponding rates among participants without MetS were 4.81%, 0.51%, 2.61%, 1.68%, and 2.47%. In NHANES, the respective mortality rates among individuals with MetS were 26.20%, 9.24%, 6.15%, 10.85%, and 13.90%, and among those without MetS were 25.80%, 8.13%, 6.31%, 11.30%, and 14.10%. Cox regression analyses showed that, in the fully adjusted models, social isolation was significantly associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality in both individuals with and without MetS. In the UK Biobank, the HRs for participants with MetS were 1.30, 1.21, 1.12, 1.38, and 1.39, respectively; for those without MetS, the HRs were 1.51, 1.75, 1.30, 1.76, and 1.54, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the HRs for the MetS group were 1.14, 1.54, 1.48, 1.71, and 1.09, respectively; while for the non-MetS group, the HRs were 1.60, 1.75, 1.47, 1.56, and 1.39, respectively. The results of the interaction and sensitivity analyses were consistent. Compared to individuals without MetS, those with MetS have higher mortality rates. Moreover, social isolation is associated with increased mortality regardless of MetS status. It is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality in both MetS and non-MetS populations. Notably, the impact of social isolation on all-cause, cardiovascular, and premature mortality is more pronounced in individuals without MetS. Public health strategies should focus on population-wide interventions to reduce social isolation, enhance social engagement, and improve overall health and longevity, rather than targeting only high-risk groups.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), is rising due to more frequent incidental findings. Despite a high 10-year survival rate of 93%, up to 28% of PTC patients experience locoregional recurrence. Postoperative monitoring typically relies on serum thyroglobulin (Tg), but the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) interferes with Tg measurement, necessitating reliable detection methods. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of postoperative TgAb levels for PTC recurrence and establish a TgAb threshold as a prognostic marker. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 15,620 patients who underwent bilateral total thyroidectomies at Gangnam Severance Hospital between March 2004 and December 2022. After excluding patients with unmeasurable postoperative TgAb or other carcinoma types, the final cohort comprised 4,434 PTC patients (775 men and 3,659 women, median age 46 ± 11.68 years). Bilateral total thyroidectomy was performed on all patients. TgAb levels were measured 2 days post-surgery and annually, with the most recent levels used for analysis. The primary outcome was PTC recurrence, analyzed based on stratified TgAb levels. Elevated TgAb levels were significantly associated with increased tumor size and recurrence rates (P < 0.001). Patients with TgAb levels above 440 IU/mL showed a higher recurrence rate (13.3%) compared to those with lower levels. A TgAb threshold of 440 IU/mL was identified as a novel recurrence marker, with an odds ratio of 6.0 (95% CI: 2.987-12.053, P < 0.0001). The disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with TgAb levels above this threshold. Postoperative TgAb levels are a useful prognostic indicator for PTC recurrence, with a proposed threshold of 440 IU/mL serving as a predictive marker. This threshold provides valuable insight for monitoring patients, irrespective of test timing post-surgery, and may guide clinical decision-making for identifying high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare B-cell Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma that predominantly affects elderly patients. While younger and fit patients receive an intensive first-line treatment, older or comorbid patients have limited options of chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) alone followed by anti-CD20-antibody maintenance. Targeted oral agents as Bruton`s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi, e.g. ibrutinib) - and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) - inhibitors (e.g. venetoclax) have revolutionized the treatment especially for relapsed patients, with apparent synergistic effects. The MCL elderly III trial of the European MCL Network is an international phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib, venetoclax and rituximab as well as the CIT bendamustine and rituximab in combination with ibrutinib in elderly patients with untreated MCL. The primary trial objective is to evaluate efficacy in both treatment arms as measured by failure-free survival at 30 months separately in both treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, response rates, overall survival, adverse events as well as quality of life and impact of frailty and sarcopenia on treatment outcome through geriatric and body composition assessments via imaging. Exploratory endpoints comprise the rate of minimal residual disease negativity and kinetics of immune reconstitution. The first patient was included in May 2023, with full site activation achieved in Q1 2025. Until May 15th 2025, 75 of 150 planned patients were enrolled in 27 German and Italian trial sites. This is the first randomized trial to exploratively compare a BTKi-Bcl2i-anti-CD20 triplet to a BTK-CIT combination in older MCL patients. The trial is registered on EU Clinical Trial Register (20225018089600).",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) image quality on radiomic analysis and evaluates the potential of deep learning-based enhancement to improve radiomic feature accuracy in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). The CBAMRegGAN model was trained on 114 paired CT and CBCT datasets from 114 nasopharyngeal cancer patients to enhance CBCT images, with CT images as ground truth. The dataset was split into 82 patients for training, 12 for validation, and 20 for testing. The radiomic features in 6 different categories, including first-order, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size-zone matrix(GLSZM), neighbouring gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM), and gray-level dependence matrix (GLDM), were extracted from the gross tumor volume (GTV) of original CBCT, enhanced CBCT, and CT. Comparing feature errors between original and enhanced CBCT showed that deep learning-based enhancement improves radiomic feature accuracy. The CBAMRegGAN model achieved improved image quality with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 29.52 ± 2.28 dB, normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.0129 ± 0.004, and structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.910 ± 0.025 for enhanced CBCT images. This led to reduced errors in most radiomic features, with average reductions across 20 patients of 19.0%, 24.0%, 3.0%, 19%, 15.0%, and 5.0% for first-order, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, and GLDM features. This study demonstrates that CBCT image quality significantly influences radiomic analysis, and deep learning-based enhancement techniques can effectively improve both image quality and the accuracy of radiomic features in NPC.",

To identify potential intervention targets, we analyzed risk factors for pneumonitis after combination therapy with ICIs and TRT. Overall, 335 patients who received TRT and ICI therapy concurrently or sequentially were included in our study. Pneumonitis was assessed and the related factors were analyzed. After combined TRT and ICI therapy, among the 335 patients, 219 (65.4%) patients had no pneumonitis or Grade 1 pneumonitis, 77 (23.0%) patients had Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 39 (11.6%) patients had Grade 3 or above pneumonitis. The incidence of Grade 2 or above pneumonitis was significantly related to the patients' age at diagnosis, sex, time interval and ipsilateral or bilateral lung dose‒volume parameters. We first showed that older, male patients are more likely to suffer from pneumonitis of Grade 2 and above. We also found that, numerically, patients who received ICIs before radiotherapy (RT) were more likely to have pneumonitis than those who received RT before ICIs. Moreover, a longer interval between treatments, lower mean lung dose (MLD) and smaller ipsilateral or bilateral lung dose‒volume parameters are correlated with a lower incidence of pneumonitis of Grade 2 or above.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the therapeutic response of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is of significant clinical importance. The use of TKIs in clinical is primarily guided by the detection of EGFR gene mutations. However, the current EGFR mutation assays face challenges such as inconsistent correlation with therapeutic outcomes, inconvenient sample availability and limited sensitivity. To address these, we have designed and synthesized a novel theranostic agent, OSA-Cy7, by conjugating the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib with the near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore Cy7. This conjugate aims to enable fluorescence-based detection of mutant EGFR and targeted therapy of NSCLC. Our studies demonstrated that OSA-Cy7 selectively accumulates in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, such as PC9 (exon 19 deletion) and H1975 (L858R/T790M), exhibiting enhanced fluorescence signals, while showing minimal uptake in wild-type EGFR A549 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that OSA-Cy7 effectively inhibits EGFR phosphorylation in mutant cell lines, with negligible effects on wild-type EGFR phosphorylation. Furthermore, OSA-Cy7 treatment resulted in significant suppression on cell proliferation and colony formation in EGFR-mutant cells, indicating its potent anticancer activity. These findings suggest that OSA-Cy7 holds promise as a theranostic agent for the selective imaging and treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC, potentially improving patient stratification and therapeutic monitoring.",

However, manual diagnosis can be challenging due to the subtle visual differences between benign and malignant lesions. This study introduces Skin-DeepNet, a novel deep learning-based framework designed for the automated early diagnosis and classification of skin cancer lesions from dermoscopy images. Skin-DeepNet incorporates a two-step pre-processing stage to enhance image contrast, followed by robust skin lesion segmentation using Mask R-CNN and GrabCut algorithm to achieve near-perfect segmentation accuracy (IOU up to 99.93%). Then a dual-feature extraction strategy is performed using a combination of a pre-trained high-resolution network (HRNet) model and attention block, which serve as feature descriptors. A deep belief networks (DBN) model is then trained on their outputs to capture high-level discriminative features. Finally, robust decision fusion strategies are employed to integrate the predictions of the proposed models using boosting and stacking to enhance overall Skin-DeepNet's accuracy. The Skin-DeepNet's performance has been validated on two challenging datasets: ISIC 2019 and HAM1000. The Skin-DeepNet system has outperformed the existing state-of-the-art systems by achieving an accuracy rate of 99.65% Precision of 99.51%, AUC of 99.94% on the ISIC 2019 dataset. Similarly, on the HAM1000 dataset, the Skin-DeepNet system demonstrated an accuracy rate, precision, and AUC of 100%, 99.92%, and 99.97%, respectively. These findings indicate that the developed Skin-DeepNet system can exhibit outstanding proficiency in accurately classifying skin lesions while aiding physicians in early diagnosis and treatment tasks in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal neuroendocrine neoplasms (CrNENs) are rare malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The roles of genetic, epigenetic, and immune factors in CrNEN progression remain largely unknown. We employed an integrative multi-omics approach combining two-sample Mendelian randomization, Bayesian colocalization, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), cis-expression QTLs (cis-eQTLs), protein QTLs (pQTLs), summary data-based Mendelian randomization, mediation analyses, immunohistochemistry validation, and pan-cancer validation using TCGA and GTEx data, including DNA methylation profiling using the SMART, UALCAN, UCSC Xena and MethSurv platforms to provide integrative insights into potential epigenetic regulation in oncogenesis. Molecular docking was performed to identify candidate therapeutic compounds that targeted the genes. Our analyses identified TREM1 as a robust therapeutic candidate, with elevated TREM1 expression promoting the progression of CrNEN. Epigenetic analysis revealed that hypomethylation at the cg04451353 locus was associated with increased TREM1 expression, mediating approximately 74% of the CrNEN risk attributable to this epigenetic mechanism. Immune mediation analysis suggested that increased TREM1 expression may influence the infiltration of specific immune subsets (CD14 + CD16- monocytes, CD25 + + CD8br Tregs, CD3 on Tregs, CD3 on CD39 + secreting Tregs, CD3 on CD8br Tregs, and CD28 on CD39 + CD8br Tregs), with each subset contributing approximately 1-4% to the total 16.65% increase in CrNEN risk. Pan-cancer validation underscored the oncogenic potential and prognostic significance of TREM1 across various malignancies, with particular relevance in the colorectal cancer. Molecular docking analysis suggested favorable binding affinities between TREM1 and bioactive natural compounds, such as artemisinin and quercetin, which may support their potential as therapeutic candidates. Multi-omics analysis suggests that TREM1 may play a role in CrNEN pathogenesis, with potential implications as a therapeutic target.

    "abstract": "Therapy resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, with multidrug resistance (MDR) being a well-characterized phenomenon wherein cancer cells develop resistance not only to the administered drug but also to structurally diverse compounds. Metal chelators, including quinolines and thiosemicarbazones, have shown broad antitumor activity and potential in overcoming MDR by modulating metal metabolism. However, predicting whether chelators increase or decrease toxicity in MDR cells remains complex, especially as chelator-metal complexes may become substrates for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, leading to resistance or hypersensitivity. In this study, we developed cell lines with comparable expression levels of the three major MDR ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2). Our findings demonstrated distinct transporter-specific influences on chelator toxicity. Cells expressing ABCC1 displayed significant resistance to thiosemicarbazones (Dp44mT, COTI-2, DpC) in both their metal-free and metal-bound forms. Vesicular transport assays further demonstrated that ABCC1 actively transports the Fe-GSH complex, formed under physiological glutathione levels, indicating its role in regulating the labile iron pool and reducing intracellular iron toxicity. These findings underscore the importance of transporter-chelator interactions in shaping drug resistance and sensitivity and highlight the intricate roles of ABC transporters in modulating chelator activity.",

However, the precise relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer LRR remains unclear. To perform a systematic review and relative risk meta-analysis to explore the assocation between breast mammographic density and breast cancer LRR. A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Mammographic breast density (MBD) was classified as BI-RADs A-B (breast density < 50%, predominately fatty or scattered areas of fibroglandular density) or BI-RADs C-D breast density > 50%, heterogeneously dense or extremely dense). A meta-anlysis was performed using Meta-Disc and Statsdirect 2.8.0. Seven studies published between 2004 and 2023 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 3008 patients with reported mammographic breast density (MBD) (age range: 20-94 years). Overall, 59.1% (1779/3008) were classified as low MBD (BI-RADS A-B) and 40.9% (1229/3008) were classified as high MBD (BI-RADS C-D). Of these patients, 68.9% (2073/3008) were treated for invasive breast carcinoma and 31.1% had ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was performed in 71.1% (2139/3008) of patients, mastectomy was performed in 28.2% (850/3008),. The median follow-up was 94.1 months, and the overall LRR rate was 12.8% (386/3008). Five of the seven studies reported a correlation between BI-RADs C-D and the development of LRR.

BI-RADS C-D density on mammography was associated with an increased risk of locoregional recurrence (pooled relative risk 1.41; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.70). Increased mammographic breast density may be associated with an increased risk of LRR.

    "abstract": "In tumorous conditions, STAT1, traditionally recognized for its anti-tumor role in immunology, exhibits pro-survival characteristics, though unclear mechanisms. Investigating STAT1 function in isogenic colorectal tumor cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS, we found that STAT1 specifically promotes tumor survival and proliferation with mutant KRAS. Gene expression profiling revealed that STAT1 promotes the expression of sterol and lipid biosynthesis genes in these cells. This effect depends on STAT1 phosphorylation at S727, which upregulates SREBP1 and SREBP2 to drive de novo lipid production. In mutant KRAS cells, STAT1 amplifies the mevalonate pathway, maintaining its S727 phosphorylation and establishing a positive feedback loop through the transcription factors YAP1 and TEAD4, further driving lipid biosynthesis and tumor growth. This STAT1-YAP1 axis promotes mutant KRAS tumor cells' resistance to mevalonate pathway inhibitors, which can be overcome by pharmacologically targeting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. Moreover, this axis contributes to the inherent resistance of mutant KRAS colon cancer cells to EGFR-targeted therapy. Together, these findings identify the STAT1-YAP1 pathway as a critical mediator of therapy resistance and a promising therapeutic target in mutant KRAS colorectal cancer.",

Several studies have demonstrated that SLAM family receptors are associated with potential immune checkpoints on T cells and play a role in tumor immunity in various cancers. However, the effect of SLAMF1 expression in tumors has been rarely investigated. Here, we confirmed SLAMF1 expression using tissue microarray analysis in breast cancer tissues with diverse pathological characteristics and subtypes. Additionally, SLAMF1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells was analyzed using flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Public clinical data analysis suggests that a positive correlation exists between SLAMF1 expression and overall survival and that SLAMF1 levels are slightly increased in patients with breast cancer who received radiation therapy. Similarly, when TNBC cells were irradiated, SLAMF1 expression specifically increased compared to that in non-irradiated cells. To study the biological function of SLAMF1 in mice, we established 4T1-SLAMF1 overexpressing a stable cell line. In the 4T1 syngenetic tumor model, SLAMF1 overexpression triggered strong infiltrating-CD8+ T cell responses and significantly reduced the tumor growth. Our results provide clear evidence for SLAMF1 expression in breast cancer and provide insights into the recent advances in SLAM-based targeted immunotherapies.",

For example, cholesteryl esters and sphingomyelins were most strongly associated with increased dementia risk in APOE4 homozygotes, whereas inverse associations with glycerides were specific to this genotype. Dimethylguanidino-valeric acid was more strongly associated with dementia risk among carriers of the rs2154481-C allele (APP). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet more effectively modulated dementia-related metabolites in APOE4 homozygotes, suggesting targeted prevention strategies. Incorporating metabolomic data modestly improved dementia risk prediction, particularly during early follow-up. Mendelian randomization analysis identified 19 putative causal relationships between metabolites and cognitive outcomes, including protective effects of 4-guanidinobutanoate, carotenoids and N<sup>6</sup>-carbamoylthreonyladenosine. These findings reveal genotype-dependent metabolic profiles of cognitive health and support precision nutrition approaches for ADRD prevention.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy have improved patient outcomes, yet responses to immunotherapy remain moderate. Immunosenescence has been shown to contribute to the development and progression of various diseases; however, its specific role in solid tumors has not been fully delineated. Here we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial involving 51 patients with cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and applied single-cell RNA as well as TCR and BCR sequencing on tumor and blood samples to elucidate the immune cell perturbations. Our findings associate poor response with reduced levels of CCR7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells and CD27<sup>+</sup> memory B cells, as well as higher expression of immunosenescence-related genes in T and B cell subsets. Using naturally aged mice and Ercc1-deficient mice (premature aging), we found that senolytics enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in multiple solid tumors by mitigating immunosenescence. Notably, we launched a phase 2 clinical trial (COIS-01) investigating the combination of senolytics with anti-PD-1 therapy. The results showed that the combination therapy achieved a 33.3% (95% confidence interval 16.6-54.7%) major pathological response rate with a low incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events (4.2%). These findings underscore the pivotal role of immunosenescence characteristics in influencing the effectiveness of immunotherapy and suggest a promising therapeutic efficacy along with a favorable safety for the combination of senolytics with anti-PD-1 therapy.

    "abstract": "In a carcinogenicity study with SD rats exposed to pyridachlometyl (dietary dose levels, 0, 200, 2000, 10,000 and 20,000 ppm), an increase in thyroid follicular cell (TFC) adenoma and/or carcinoma was observed in male rats at ≥ 2000 ppm but not in female rats. We evaluated the mode of action (MOA) of pyridachlometyl-induced TFC tumor formation and its relevance to humans. Pyridachlometyl was neither genotoxic, cytotoxic nor immunosuppressive based on a series of toxicity studies. Data from general toxicity studies suggested that the MOA involve altered homeostasis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) induction. Short-term in vivo MOA studies in SD rats showed that pyridachlometyl caused T<sub>4</sub>-UGT induction in liver, an increase in serum TSH, TFC hypertrophy and/or an increase in TFC replicative DNA synthesis at the early phase of the treatment. In a perchlorate discharge test, pyridachlometyl did not inhibit iodine uptake or iodine organification, indicating that pyridachlometyl does not inhibit sodium iodide symporter nor thyroperoxidase in vivo. Since rats are more sensitive to TFC tumors due to HPT axis perturbations than humans, it is generally accepted that TFC tumors in rats caused by this MOA are not relevant to humans. Overall, these data strongly support that the MOA for pyridachlometyl-induced TFC tumors in male rats is via HPT axis perturbations by UGT induction, indicating that the TFC tumor formation by pyridachlometyl observed in male rats is not relevant to human cancer risk.",

This study evaluates the geometric and dosimetric differences between target volumes defined by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and PET images in accelerator-based BNCT using the NeuPex system. The GTV (gross tumor volume) was defined based on MRI (GTV<sub>MRI</sub>) and PET images with SUV thresholds of 2.0 (GTV<sub>PET2.0</sub>) and 2.5 (GTV<sub>PET2.5</sub>) in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) and malignant glioma (MG). GTV<sub>PET2.5</sub> was approximately 50% smaller, while GTV<sub>PET2.0</sub> showed closer volumetric agreement, with ∆V% of 23.52 ± 17.44 (HNC) and 28.71 ± 12.57 (MG), and corresponding Dice similarity coefficients of 0.71 ± 0.14 and 0.86 ± 0.17. Dosimetric analysis revealed that GTV<sub>PET2.0</sub> achieved higher dose coverage than GTV<sub>MRI</sub>, with mean doses of 24.07 ± 6.42 Gy-Eq (HNC) and 26.36 ± 9.77 Gy-Eq (MG), and D<sub>80</sub> values of 19.01 ± 6.90 Gy-Eq and 21.00 ± 7.51 Gy-Eq, respectively.

A TBR threshold of ≥ 2.0 is proposed as a practical criterion for patient selection. While this study focuses on geometric and dosimetric endpoints, future work correlating these findings with clinical outcomes is warranted.

We linked national health datasets to New Zealand Cancer Registry lung cancer registrations from the period 2012-2019 (n = 18,081) to describe the radiation therapy delivery overall and in terms of treatment intent patterns, for all lung cancer registrations and by tumor type. We use marginal standardization and regression modeling to describe the extent to which these treatment factors vary by patient characteristic and population sub-group, independent of other factors. Around 40% of people with lung cancer had radiation therapy, with similar proportions among those with small cell lung cancer (SCLC, 53%) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 46%). Patterns of radiation therapy among those with SCLC were different from NSCLC and from lung cancer overall, in terms of stage, ethnicity, and deprivation. We observed lower rates of radiation therapy among those with the greatest socioeconomic deprivation among those with SCLC. Across all tumor types, and for lung cancer overall, those with higher comorbidity had lower rates of radiation therapy. We observed variation in the receipt of radiation therapy for people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012-2019 in Aotearoa New Zealand in terms of tumor type, stage, ethnicity, deprivation, and comorbidity but not rurality. Differences for Asian and Pacific people and the lack of variation by rurality are potential topics for further research.",

Homologous transporters evolved to couple transport to different ions in response to changing environments and needs. The bases of such diversification and, thus, principles of ion coupling are unexplored. Here, using phylogenetics and ancestral protein reconstruction, we investigated sodium-coupled transport in prokaryotic glutamate transporters, a mechanism ubiquitous across life domains and critical to neurotransmitter recycling in humans by excitatory amino acid transporters from the solute carrier 1 family. By inferring ancestral prokaryotic transporter sequences during a change in the ion-coupling mechanism, we found an evolutionary transition from sodium-dependent to independent substrate binding and transport. Structural and functional experiments on ancestral transporters suggest that the transition involved allosteric mutations, rendering sodium binding dispensable without affecting the ion-binding sites. Allosteric tuning of transporters' energy landscapes might be a widespread route of their functional diversification.",

    "abstract": "Germ cells are unique in that they tailor chromatin toward generating totipotency. Accordingly, mammalian spermatogonia, including spermatogonial stem cells that constitute the source for male gametes, acquire distinctive chromatin organization with weak insulation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that STAG3, so far known to exclusively form meiotic cohesins, generates a mitotic cohesin for male germline nucleome programming in mice. Owing to its shorter chromatin residence, STAG3-cohesin attenuates topologically associating domains, rewires enhancer-promoter and Polycomb-mediated repressive interactions, and facilitates finer and more strengthened compartments, establishing a distinctive spermatogonial nucleome. Moreover, in the absence of STAG3-cohesin, spermatogonial stem cells show an impaired differentiation priming for spermatogenesis. Mitotic STAG3-cohesin is also expressed in human B cells and their malignant variations, promoting their propagation. Our findings on mitotic STAG3-cohesin elucidate a principle of male germline nucleome programming, demonstrate an unexpected mitotic role for STAG3 and might potentially improve understanding of human malignancies.",

Our platform comprises diverse modules capable of generating >2,500 combinations with any antigen and displaying distinct antigen epitopes on the cell surface. We quantify the CST efficacy of various modules using multiple antigens, including the mpox virus (MPXV) proteins A29, M1R and A35R, and compare chimeric antigen surface expression in multiple cell lines. Using MPXV as a model, we identify optimal modules that enhance the CST of multiple MPXV antigens, improving the immune response of lipid nanoparticle mRNAs and protecting against lethal viral challenge. With these effective CST modules, we further demonstrate the generalizability of MVP by optimizing additional mRNA antigens, including the human papillomavirus 16 proteins E6 and E7 and the varicella zoster virus glycoprotein gE.

However, our recent studies have revealed a critical role for Ephexin1 in the pathogenesis of colon and lung cancers. Here we used multidisciplinary approaches to further explore the underlying mechanisms of Ephexin1 in cancer progression. We discovered that Ephexin1 is essential for promoting polysome formation by coordinating the assembly of translation initiation complexes. Our investigations into gene expression affected by Ephexin1 deficiency showed that Ephexin1 specifically promotes the translation of genes containing 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) or 5'-TOP-like motifs, identifying Ephexin1 as a key mediator of mTOR-regulated translation. Importantly, we found that the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in treating lung cancer was significantly enhanced in a mouse xenograft model when Ephexin1 was deficient. This suggests that Ephexin1 could serve as a synthetic lethality target for mTORC1-targeting therapeutics in cancer treatment. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of Ephexin1 in cancer pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for improving current cancer treatment strategies.",

Machine learning methods, such as neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and logistic regression classifiers, were employed to compare the predictive performance. Among these, the neural network model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy. The random forest model achieved the best balance between model fit and complexity, as indicated by its lowest akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion values.

In addition, high IL13RA2 expression was significantly associated with increased nonsynonymous mutations. We next detected high IL-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2) expression in angiosarcoma cell lines and patient samples compared to other cell types and benign vascular tumors.

This study aimed to develop and validate a DNA methylation assay for the early detection and monitoring for UC, with a focus on its diagnostic and prognostic implications. The DNA methylation assay with real-time methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (RT-MSP) technique measures the methylation level of SOX1-OT and HIST1H4F in urine samples. A cohort comprising 436 patients diagnosed with UC or other urologic disease as well as 79 healthy patients was retrospectively utilized to evaluate this assay. Furthermore, UC patients who underwent surgery are included to assess its ability to detect recurrence. The DNA methylation assay demonstrated significantly increased methylation level in tumor tissues and a high positive rate in urine samples from UC patients. The methylation profile effectively distinguishes UC from other non-UC urologic disease, exhibiting a high sensitivity (85.2%) and specificity (90.0%) for UC diagnosis. Furthermore, the assay showed promising ability in differentiating UC patients based on tumor grade, malignancy potential, and disease stage. Additionally, the DNA methylation assay demonstrated a superior ability to detect UC recurrence with a high area under curve (AUC) of 0.979.

We show that romidepsin, a class-I HDAC inhibitor, elicits a combinatorial perturbation of distinct molecular processes in HCC cells, altering lipid composition, mitotic spindle machinery, and levels of cell cycle/survival signals. Collectively, these alterations lead HCC cells to a vulnerable state, conferring dependency to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling support. The cytostatic effects of romidepsin alone is converted into cytotoxicity by the RTK inhibitor cabozantinib in HCC models. We document that romidepsin+cabozantibib confers an immune-stimulatory profile in Alb-R26<sup>Met</sup> mouse models, with direct effects on primary human dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Our findings put forward the intricate crosstalk between epigenetics, metabolism, and immune response in cancer. The broad action of romidepsin on distinct cellular functions highlights its therapeutic potential for HCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "The limited response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a significant challenge in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In our study, we identified a lactate-based chemical barrier surrounding FAP<sup>+</sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the LUAD microenvironment (TME), which may hinder the infiltration and function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Further investigation revealed that FAP<sup>+</sup> CAFs specifically overexpress LINC01711, which drives lactate production by promoting FGFR1-mediated phosphorylation of lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA) at the Y10 site and facilitating the formation of active LDHA tetramers. These FAP<sup>+</sup> CAFs then export lactate into TME via the MCT4 transporter, thereby establishing a chemical barrier and fostering an immunosuppressive TME. Notably, we developed a small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-based in vivo self-assembled siRNA system for in vivo knockdown of LINC01711 and demonstrated its potential to enhance the response rate to ICIs in LUAD. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of FAP<sup>+</sup> CAFs in driving resistance to ICIs and propose novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this obstacle.",

    "abstract": "With the development of medical and health care, esophageal cancer (EC) has become a disease of concern to the scientific research community. At present, among all treatment regimens for EC, surgical resection is conducive to the prognosis of early patients neoadjuvant therapies are recommended for advanced patients. However, treatments now are not satisfactory in suppressing the progression of EC. Ferroptosis is one distinctive cell death mode, noted for the accumulation of iron as well as lipotoxicity, which induce cell membrane to breakdown. As a star protein of ferroptosis related pathway, GPX4 is related to the homeostatic imbalance of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of EC, thereby regulating the onset as well as progression of the cancer. In our manuscript, we present the mechanisms involved in ferroptosis, the functions of ferroptosis in the TIME. We also focused on the progression about ferroptosis in EC, as well as targeting ferroptosis-related pathways to delay the development of EC. We expect that these contents can expand fresh insights and aim for EC therapeutic strategy in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate regimen and dosage of preoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC) with bulky lymph nodes (LNs) remain controversial. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy using a modified regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1 (DCS) for GC with bulky LNs, assessing feasibility, toxicity, response rate, and oncological outcomes. Thirty-two patients who had GC with bulky LNs diagnosed between Jan, 2018 and Oct, 2022 received three or four cycles of modified DCS regimen preoperatively. The primary outcome was 3 year overall survival (OS). The completion rate of preoperative chemotherapy was 90.6% (4 cycles: 50.0%, 3 cycles: 40.6%). The disease control rate (DCR) and clinical response rate (RR) were 87.5% and 81.3%, respectively. Grade-3/4 neutropenia and anemia developed in 6.2% and 9.4%, respectively. Twenty-two patients with partial response (PR) agreed to undergo gastrectomy and LN dissection. Pathologic complete response (CR) was achieved in 15.6%. After surgery, there were no grade >  = 3 postoperative complications. The R0-resection rate was 65.6%. The 3 year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 43.0% and 37%, respectively, for all eligible patients. The 3 year OS and PFS of patients in the surgery group with negative para-aortic LNs were 58% and 47.0%, respectively. Preoperative chemotherapy with a modified DCS regimen demonstrated high tolerance, a clinical response rate, and satisfactory 3 year survival outcomes. Thus, a preoperative modified DCS regimen with 3-4 cycles is a promising approach for GC with bulky LNs.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive and fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the spatial and functional organization of its cellular components remains poorly understood. We present an integrated transcriptomic atlas of the PDAC TME by combining single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 88; 187,520 cells), Visium spatial transcriptomics (n = 20; 67,933 spots), bulk RNA sequencing (n = 1,383), and high-resolution Xenium spatial transcriptomics (n = 2; 307,679 cells). Key findings were validated using scRNA-seq, bulk datasets, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and spatial imaging. POSTN⁺ fibroblasts and SPP1⁺ macrophages consistently co-infiltrated across 12 independent bulk RNA-seq cohorts, and showed spatial correlation in both Visium and Xenium platforms. Those tumor-promoting cell states were enriched in hypoxic, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and were linked to poor prognosis. In contrast, CCL4⁺ CD8⁺ effector T cells and IGHG1⁺ plasma cells co-occurred within immune-active niches, were enriched for cytotoxic and activation-related pathways, and were associated with improved patient survival. Notably, these protective immune subsets remained detectable despite the immunosuppressive nature of the PDAC TME. Expression specificity of POSTN, SPP1, CCL4, and IGHG1 was validated at the transcriptomic and protein levels. We delineate two opposing cellular programs in the PDAC TME-tumor-promoting stromal remodeling and anti-tumor immune activation-spatially organized in distinct niches. Those findings suggest that targeting POSTN⁺ fibroblasts and SPP1⁺ macrophages-mediated stromal interactions while promoting CCL4⁺ T cell and IGHG1⁺ plasma cell immunity, may offer new therapeutic strategies for PDAC.",

    "title": "Physiological Considerations and Delivery Strategies for Targeting Tumors Through Intraperitoneal Delivery.",
    "abstract": "The peritoneal cavity presents both unique challenges and promising opportunities for targeted therapy in malignancies like ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. Intraperitoneal drug delivery offers significant pharmacokinetic advantages over intravenous administration by achieving high local drug concentrations and tumor-specific delivery potential while minimizing systemic toxicity. Despite these theoretical advantages, the clinical implementation of intraperitoneal therapy is limited by several barriers, including restricted tissue penetration, incomplete peritoneal coverage, rapid drug clearance, catheter-related complications, posttreatment peritoneal adhesions, and ascites-induced permeability dysregulation. This review highlights three advanced strategies developed to overcome these obstacles: (1) particulate-based delivery systems, such as nanoparticles to enhance tumor specificity through passive accumulation, active targeting and on-demand drug release in response to internal or external stimuli; (2) Sustained drug release hydrogels and (3) pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy. Despite promising preclinical and clinical advancements, successful translation requires systematic optimization of multiple parameters, such as ascites dynamics, tumor heterogeneity, and multidrug resistance. The integration of advanced delivery technologies with a comprehensive understanding of peritoneal physiology remains crucial for achieving safe and effective clinical applications.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying GBM's adaptability to metabolic stress is crucial for developing effective treatments. This study investigates the role of Brain Protein I3 (BRI3) in regulating lipid metabolism and autophagy in GBM, and its potential as a therapeutic target. We performed integrative bioinformatics analysis using TCGA-GBM and CGGA datasets to identify lipophagy-related gene signatures. BRI3's function was examined through in vitro studies using GBM cell lines and patient-derived samples. Lipid metabolism and autophagy were assessed under normal and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions in BRI3-knockdown and control GBM cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a lipophagy-related gene signature associated with poor prognosis in GBM. BRI3 emerged as a key upregulated gene in GBM, correlating with altered lipid homeostasis and enhanced autophagy. In vitro studies demonstrated that BRI3 knockdown led to lipid accumulation, impaired autophagy, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis in GBM cells. Under OGD conditions mimicking the tumor microenvironment, BRI3-depleted cells showed compromised lipid mobilization, autophagy induction, and cell survival compared to controls. Our findings suggest BRI3 as a critical regulator of lipophagy in GBM, enhancing tumor cell resilience to metabolic stress. This study provides insights into GBM's metabolic adaptability and identifies BRI3 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating tumor cell survival in the challenging glioblastoma microenvironment.",

A cohort of 1671 patients was considered for allocation to a phase I study, of whom 518 patients were recruited to a phase I study and 1153 patients were not. A multivariable analysis revealed polypharmacy was associated with lower recruitment to phase I trials with an odds ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: [0.92, 0.99], p = 0.01), and a greater number of emergency admissions with a risk ratio of 1.1 (95% CI: [1.03, 1.17], p = 0.01).

A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing LDG (2017-2023) was conducted. To minimize selection bias between the URY (n = 175) and conventional Roux-en-Y (RY) (n = 69) groups, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM).

After PSM, the baseline characteristics of the URY and RY groups (n = 49 each) were well-balanced. In the matched cohort, the URY group demonstrated significantly shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, and shorter postoperative hospital stays compared to the RY group. Similarly, after matching, perioperative and nutritional outcomes were comparable between the SRS and CRS subgroups (n = 23 each).

For <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PSMA-radioguided surgery, an innovative gantry-free hybrid imaging technique has recently been proposed, namely handheld single-photon emission computed tomography (hSPECT) combined with light detection and ranging (LiDAR). This study aimed to assess the feasibility and performance of hSPECT/LiDAR in analyzing tissue specimens excised after robotic <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PSMA-radioguided surgery. We included samples from 5 prostate cancer patients undergoing primary or salvage robot-assisted resection of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PSMA-I&S avid lesions that were identified using a drop-in gamma probe. 12 samples (1 prostatic tissue, 1 local recurrence tissue, 10 lymph nodes) were analyzed ex vivo using a custom-built specimen tray, including an optical reference tracker for scan registration. LiDAR was used to acquire a surface scan of the specimens, and the 3D OBJ image output was fused with the 3D DICOM of a hSPECT obtained using a handheld gamma camera and DeclipseSPECT tracking system. hSPECT/LiDAR imaging provided accurate representation of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PSMA-I&S uptake within the specimens.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) on survival in ESCC patients. From five medical centers, 273 ESCC patients were studied, receiving either neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (nICT) or nCT. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint, with locoregional recurrence-free survival (L-RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (D-MFS) as secondary endpoints. To address confounding biases, propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were utilized. An 18-month landmark analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves assessed survival differences. The pathological response was significantly improved in the nICT group compared to the nCT group. Cox analysis confirmed nICT as an independent factor associated with better prognosis (HR = 3.05, 95% CI 1.81-5.14, p < 0.001). Before matching, the nICT group showed superior RFS (p < 0.001), L-RFS (p = 0.002), and D-MFS (p < 0.001). After PSM, nICT showed its advantage in RFS (p < 0.001) and D-MFS (p = 0.003), with a trend toward improved L-RFS (p = 0.075). Similarly, after IPTW, nICT maintained its survival benefit in RFS (p = 0.001), D-MFS (p = 0.015), with an observed trend toward enhanced L-RFS (p = 0.085). Stratified analyses revealed greater survival benefits of nICT in patients with ypStage III/IV (p < 0.001). The 18-month landmark analysis demonstrated that nICT significantly enhanced RFS (p < 0.001), L-RFS (p = 0.048), and D-MFS (p < 0.001) with the first 18 months after surgery. nICT substantially improves prognostic outcomes in LA-ESCC patients, especially in terms of D-MFS and the period of the first 18-month post-surgery, suggesting nICT could be a more effective treatment strategy. Besides, more prospective investigations are required to substantiate these findings.",

Studies on laparoscopic surgery initially showed mixed results regarding long-term oncologic safety, but current data is favorable. Evidence supporting the robotic approach remains limited. This study examined trends in robotic surgery, including facilitation of high-quality oncologic resection, defined by lymph node yield and negative margins, using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data. A multicenter cohort study analyzed 87,611 patients with stage I-III rectal cancer undergoing definitive resection between 2010 and 2021. Outcomes included robotic surgery rates, high-quality oncologic resection (defined using lymph node yield and surgical margins), length of stay, 30-day readmission, and mortality. Outcomes were stratified into tertiles (2010-2013, 2014-2017, 2018-2021) and analyzed via univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions. Robotic surgery use rose from 10.1% (2010-2013) of oncologic resection to 45.7% (2018-2021) (p < 0.001). High-quality oncologic resection improved over time: 65.4% to 75.3% (p < 0.001). Compared to open surgery, robotic surgery had 1.39 times higher odds of achieving high-quality oncologic resection (p < 0.001). Despite both improving over time, robotics had higher odds than laparoscopic surgery of high-quality oncologic resection in each tertile (e.g., 2018-2021 OR 1.64, CI 1.49-1.81 vs. OR 1.44, CI 1.30-1.61; respectively). High-volume centers further increased the likelihood of successful outcomes (OR 1.6, p < 0.001). Robotic and laparoscopic approaches were associated with significantly lower mortality compared to open surgery (OR 0.63, p < 0.001; OR 0.72, p < 0.001, respectively). Robotic surgery has significantly improved in oncologic measures, including rates of quality surgical resection and patients' overall survival, over the past decade, outperforming laparoscopic and open techniques.

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation (EP) is a rare but life-threatening condition with an incidence of approximately 3.1 per million annually. While iatrogenic injury during endoscopy is the leading cause, other etiologies include spontaneous rupture, trauma, and malignancy. EP can present with nonspecific symptoms, most commonly chest pain or dysphagia, and diagnostic delays are associated with worse outcomes. Multiple non-operative strategies exist, including primary closure, stenting (bypass), combination therapy, and conservative management. However, data guiding the optimal approach remain limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of different non-operative management strategies for EP and identify predictors of successful repair. We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with EP across three Mayo Clinic sites between 2007 and 2023. Patients were categorized into four groups based on treatment modality. Demographics, clinical features, imaging, endoscopic intervention, and outcomes were recorded. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as avoidance of surgical intervention. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of success. A total of 72 patients were included (mean age 63.7 years, 65.3% male). The most common cause was iatrogenic injury (58.3%), and the distal esophagus was the most frequent site (67.6%). Non-operative success was 100% in the primary closure and combination groups, and 42.9% in the conservative group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, non-conservative therapy significantly predicted success (aOR 22.4, 95% CI [1.2-407.4], p = 0.036). Primary closure and combination endoscopic approaches offer superior outcomes in managing EP.

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive thoracic surgery techniques, such as robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) and uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UVATS), have revolutionized lung cancer treatment. However, comparative data on postoperative pain and functional recovery remain limited. This cohort study evaluates differences in pain intensity and pain-related activity limitations following radical lobectomy for lung cancer. A total of 140 patients undergoing lobectomy (70 RATS, 70 UVATS) were prospectively assessed. Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and functional impact was evaluated with the Daily Activity Pain Interference Questionnaire (DAPIQ) on postoperative days 3 and 14. Demographic factors, including sex and body mass index (BMI), were analyzed as potential modifiers. Patients in the RATS group reported significantly higher VAS scores compared to the UVATS group on postoperative day 3 (5.8 ± 2.0 vs. 3.8 ± 1.6; p < 0.001) and day 14 (2.7 ± 1.1 vs. 2.2 ± 1.1; p = 0.001). Only 17.1% of RATS patients were pain-free by day 14, compared to 34.3% in the UVATS group (p = 0.016). The likelihood of pain-related activity interference was 3.8 times higher in the RATS group. Female sex and lower BMI were associated with worse pain outcomes. VAS scores strongly correlated with DAPIQ results (β = 0.43). This study demonstrates that RATS is associated with significantly greater postoperative pain and functional limitations than UVATS following lobectomy for lung cancer. These findings underscore the importance of tailored pain management strategies in robotic thoracic surgery, particularly for higher-risk subgroups. Integration of the DAPIQ questionnaire into routine postoperative care may enhance functional recovery monitoring.",

Here we established a dynamic epigenetic atlas using multiomics data from 533 colorectal tissues spanning normal to advanced adenoma to cancer, identifying 7,492 differential CREs linked to 5,490 target genes. High-throughput CRISPR interference screening revealed 265 functional CREs involved in CRC cell proliferation. A polygenic risk score (PRS) based on functional CRE variants effectively predicted CRC and precancerous lesions among 476,770 individuals. Notably, the functional variant rs10871066 was significantly associated with increased risk of precancerous lesions and CRC (odds ratio = 1.27, P = 1.03 × 10<sup>-13</sup>). Mechanistically, rs10871066 triggers silencer-to-enhancer switching mediated by FOXP1 and TCF7L2, distally upregulating KLF5 to activate oncogenic pathways and PIBF1 to suppress natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Our study provides a comprehensive resource of dynamic epigenomic atlas, a functionally informed PRS for risk prediction and insights into epigenetic mechanisms underlying CRC development.",

However, the role of the combined effects of exposure to these factors on respiratory ailments remains unclear. Here we investigate the association of combined exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), climate factors, and green space during the prenatal period with respiratory diseases in infants. We enrolled 454 participants from the ongoing prospective birth cohort known as the Mothers and Children's Environmental Health study. Data on infant respiratory diseases were collected from parents or guardians. Average exposure values of TRAP, climate factors, and green spaces for the study population were calculated based on geocoded residential addresses. Multiple logistic regression and quantile-based g-calculation models were utilized to examine the association of exposure to environmental factors and green space with respiratory diseases. The combined exposure to climate factors and TRAP during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases in infants. High levels of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and temperature increased the risk of respiratory diseases (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.615, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001, 2.658). Additionally, the risk of respiratory diseases from exposure to air pollution and temperature was associated with lower tertiles of residential green spaces. The AOR was 1.064 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.133) per 1 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1.057 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.116) per 1 ppb increase in NO<sub>2</sub>, and 1.108 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.176) per 1 ℃ increase in temperature. Incorporating green space into the analysis of joint exposure to climate factors and air pollution reduced the risk of respiratory disease. This study proposes that combined exposures to climate factors, TRAP, and green spaces during pregnancy are associated with infant respiratory diseases. Fewer residential green spaces could enhance the association of climate factors and air pollution with respiratory diseases.",

Overall, 5107 IBD patients [mean age 57.0 (SD: 8.0) years; 51.7% female] were included in the prospective cohort. General obesity was assessed using body mass index (BMI), while central obesity was evaluated using hip circumference, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), conicity index (CI) and A Body Shape Index (ABSI). Primary outcome was all-cause death. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the associations. During a median of 14.6 years' follow-up, 591 all-cause deaths occurred. At baseline, 1681(32.9%), 2229(43.6%), 1161(22.7%) and 36(0.70%) patients were BMI-defined normal, overweight, obesity and underweight. Underweight individuals had a 2.22-fold increased mortality risk than those with normal BMI (HR = 3.22, 95% CI:1.70-6.11), while null associations were observed for overweight or obesity. As for central obesity, individuals with the highest quartiles of WC (HR = 1.34, 1.02-1.76), WHR (HR = 1.56, 1.13-2.15), WWI (HR = 1.64, 1.24-2.16), CI (HR = 1.72, 1.28-2.30) and ABSI (HR = 1.64, 1.23-2.20) had a 34%, 56%, 64%, 72% and 64% greater mortality risk versus the lowest quartiles, with significant dose-response relationships (all P values < 0.05). Central obesity and underweight, rather than general obesity, are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in IBD patients.

In this study, we employed an integrated, multi-scale approach to investigate how melanoma CSCs respond to siRNA-mediated silencing of three key regulatory genes: KLF4, SHH, and HIF1α. Using a combination of morphological, molecular, spectroscopic, and elemental analyses, we explored structural and biochemical consequences of gene knockdown. Gene silencing resulted in significant changes in cell shape and size, reduced F-actin organization, and decreased PFN1 expression, indicating a loss of stem-like properties. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed shifts in biomolecular composition, notably a reduction in amide III intensity and an increase in lipid ester content. SEM-EDS point-based elemental analysis revealed SEM-EDS point-based elemental analysis revealed relative differences in carbon and nitrogen levels between selected central and peripheral regions of silenced and control cells, at the micron-scale working depth, reflecting broader elemental distribution trends rather than precise subcellular compartmentalization. XPS analysis further confirmed these differences, providing additional insights into the elemental composition of the cellular surface. The integration of FTIR spectroscopy into this study highlights the potential of infrared spectroscopy as a powerful tool in cancer research. These findings demonstrate that targeting critical regulatory pathways induces cytoskeletal and biochemical remodelling in melanoma CSCs, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on cellular plasticity.",

Comprehensive textural analyses using XRD, HRTEM, FESEM, AFM, and N₂ adsorption revealed high surface area, nanoscale morphology, and porosity, which are advantageous for antimicrobial and therapeutic bioelectronic platforms. Mechanical characterization via ultrasonic pulse-echo indicated auxetic behavior, a rare and valuable trait for flexible substrates.

Thermal analyses showed a phase transition at 44 °C and decomposition onset at 70 °C. A temperature-induced insulator-to-metal transition was observed, suggesting potential for thermally activated sensing, temperature-triggered drug release, and adaptive signal modulation. Biological assays confirmed strong antimicrobial activity, with a 30 mm inhibition zone against Bacillus subtilis (agar well diffusion), and potent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with an IC₅₀ of 18.4 μg/mL (MTT assay).

However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to clarify PIGU's role and mechanisms in ESCC by analyzing its expression across pan-cancer datasets, clinical relevance in TCGA-ESCA samples, and effects on cell behavior (migration, invasion, proliferation) and signaling pathways, validated via immunohistochemistry. To examine cell behavior, we used Transwell, colony-formation, CCK-8, and wound-healing assays to assess migration, invasion, proliferation, and wound healing.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker levels were measured using Western blot analysis, and the cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry in conjunction with western blotting. Furthermore, we used western blotting to examine proteins implicated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.To further confirm PIGU's role in ESCC progression, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was employed. Our findings suggest that PIGU is highly expressed in ESCC and is strongly associated with tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis, and is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients.PIGU knockdown not only arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis, but also significantly reduced migration, invasion, and proliferation in ESCC cells. Additionally, vimentin and N-cadherin were downregulated when PIGU expression was silenced, although E-cadherin expression was simultaneously increased.Moreover, PIGU knockdown decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In vivo, PIGU knockdown inhibited ESCC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. These findings imply that targeting PIGU may represent a promising therapeutic approach, and that PIGU could potentially serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).",

However, the role of ADAM17 in modulating the pathogenesis of type 2 allergic asthma is largely unknown. To determine the in vivo contribution of ADAM17 in house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation and adaptive immune response, we assessed the deletion of ADAM17 in mice conventional dendritic cells (ΔDC) and employed a complementary chemical biology approach using small-molecule novel ADAM17 inhibitor (2155-17). DC-specific ADAM17 ablation (ΔDC) suppressed type 2/ eosinophilic polarized HDM allergic responses and is protected from developing AHR.

Intranasal administration of 2155-17 protected WT mice against type2/ eosinophilic polarized HDM allergic responses. These concurrent results from two independent approaches identify a novel role for ADAM17 as an upstream site in airway inflammation.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, including proteomics, transcriptomics, and ubiquitinomics, to investigate the mechanism of PF-3758309 in HCT116 cells. Our results revealed that PF-3758309 promotes the degradation of RNA polymerase II subunit proteins (POLR2A/B/E) via the cullin-RING ligase pathway. This process is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2), and is independent of PAK4. Furthermore, the small-molecule inhibitor MLN4924, which blocks NEDD8-activating enzyme, reversed the degradation of POLR2A/B/E, supporting the role of ubiquitin-proteasome pathways in this process.

In vitro performance tests, cell experiments, and in vivo animal models have confirmed that the CPIP@EV-CM combined with US has better ROS production, tumor cell killing, and antimetastasis abilities. The heterogenic fusion membrane strategy and ultrasound-augmented nanoplatform present exciting prospects for designing tumor-immunogenic, self-adjuvant, and expandable vaccines, providing new ideas for exploring new melanoma immunotherapy and antimetastasis strategies, which is expected to be used as a safe and effective treatment in clinical practice.",

    "title": "High content-imaging drug synergy screening identifies specific senescence-related vulnerabilities of mesenchymal neuroblastomas.",
    "abstract": "Neuroblastomas encompass malignant cells with varying degrees of differentiation, ranging from adrenergic (adr) cells resembling the sympathoadrenal lineage to undifferentiated, stem-cell-like mesenchymal (mes) cancer cells. Relapsed neuroblastomas, which often have mesenchymal features, have a poor prognosis and respond less to anticancer therapies, necessitating the development of novel treatment strategies. To identify novel treatment options, we analyzed the sensitivity of 91 pediatric cell models, including patient-derived tumoroid cultures, to a drug library of 76 anti-cancer drugs at clinically relevant concentrations. This included 24 three-dimensionally cultured neuroblastoma cell lines representing the range of mesenchymal to adrenergic subtypes. High-throughput ATP-based luminescence measurements were compared to high-content confocal imaging. With machine learning-supported imaging analysis, we focused on changes in the lysosomal compartment as a marker for therapy-induced senescence and assessed the basal lysosomal levels in a subset of untreated mesenchymal versus adrenergic cells. We correlated these findings with pathway activity signatures based on bulk RNA and scRNAseq. Comprehensive image-based synergy screens with spheroid cultures validated the combined effects of selected drugs on proliferation and cytotoxicity. Mesenchymal models presented high basal lysosomal levels correlating with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and sphingolipid metabolism pathways. Chemotherapy treatment further increased lysosome numbers, indicative of therapy-induced senescence. Furthermore, the mesenchymal subtypes correlated with MAPK activity and sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Lysosomal and SASP signaling is druggable by inhibitors of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (SLMi) or senolytics, including BCL2-family inhibitors. Especially the sequential combination of MEK inhibitors (MEKi) with BCL2-family inhibitors was the most effective on relapsed neuroblastoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis of 223 patient samples, drug sensitivity profiling of five patient-derived fresh tissue cultures, and in vivo zebrafish embryo neuroblastoma xenograft models confirmed these findings. Inhibition of MAPK signaling in combination with BCL2-family inhibitors is a novel treatment option for patients suffering from relapsed neuroblastomas.",

    "abstract": "The intake of sugars, especially glucose and fructose, has significantly increased with the change of lifestyle. Excessive intake of sugar has been proven to be associated with tumors and inflammatory diseases. Fructose directly mediates innate immune responses; however, whether it can directly regulate T-cell immunity remains unknown. We show that high fructose consumption accelerates the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by promoting the generation of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells. It was demonstrated that fructose promotes the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells directly by enhancing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation through the glutamine metabolism-dependent pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is also involved in fructose-induced Th17 cell generation. Moreover, metformin can reverse Th1 and Th17 cell generation induced by fructose by suppressing mTORC1 activation and reducing ROS-mediated TGF-β activation. Finally, we identified metformin as an in vivo therapeutic drug for relieving high fructose consumption-induced T-cell inflammation and colitis aggravation. Our study revealed a previously unknown adverse effect of high fructose consumption in disrupting immune homeostasis and exacerbating IBD by directly promoting T-cell immunity, and showed metformin is a potential therapeutic for reversing the T cell immune imbalance caused by long-term high fructose consumption.",

The two-arm, cluster randomised controlled KOPAL trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of a timely SPHC nurse-patient consultation followed by an interprofessional telephone case conference between general practitioners and SPHC teams. This study was a component of the KOPAL trial and aims to explore general practitioners' (GP) experiences with treating CNMD patients before and with case conferences and with the following consequences for treatment and interprofessional collaboration with SPHC teams. Qualitative evaluation of the KOPAL trial focussing on GPs' perspective. Open guided interviews using narrative techniques analysed with grounded theory. The KOPAL trial was conducted in Lower Saxony and the metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany. 24 GPs who participated in the intervention group of the trial were interviewed. Findings show that GPs have practice-specific routines when caring for people with CNMD. Interprofessional case conferences may lead to more awareness regarding gaps in primary palliative care, one's own care routines or a lack of psychosocial support. Although gaining new insights, GPs follow three different strategies following the case conferences: (1) Maintain routines of care and disregard added value, (2) extend routines of care according to SPHC advice and (3) integration and partial change of care routines caused by SPHC support. These strategies are influenced by GPs' perception of SPHC teams (eg, ambivalence towards SPHC). Interprofessional case conferences to timely discuss care options could improve healthcare for patients with advanced CNMD by revealing gaps in care. Promoting a regular process of exchange between GPs and SPHC teams (such as through round tables) may improve a trusting cooperation. DRKSS00017795.",

Although ubiquitination dysregulation is linked to tumor progression, a comprehensive, multicancer framework integrating prognostic, molecular, and microenvironmental landscapes is lacking. This study integrated data of 4,709 patients from 26 cohorts across five solid tumor types (lung cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, urothelial cancer, and melanoma) and mapped the molecular profiles to the interaction network. Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier survival method were employed for prognostic analysis. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed to identify the key downstream pathways and genes. Findings were validated using independent patient cohorts, cell line models, and in vivo experiments. Key nodes and prognostic pathways within the ubiquitination-modification network were identified. A conserved ubiquitination-related prognostic signature (URPS) effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes across all analyzed cancers. URPS may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response, with the potential to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy in clinical settings. A comprehensive analysis of URPS-associated proteins revealed novel cancer-related interaction partners as potential drug targets. At the single-cell resolution, URPS enabled more precise classification of distinct cell types and was associated with macrophage infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. In vivo, in vitro, and patient cohort analyses, demonstrated that OTUB1-TRIM28 ubiquitination plays a crucial role in modulating MYC pathway and influencing patient prognosis. We constructed a pancancer ubiquitination regulatory network and prognostic model, revealing important pathways, and offering insights into predicting patient prognosis and understanding biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics, employing design principles similar to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) but replacing cytotoxic payloads with immune-stimulatory agents. These agents enhance immune system activation, enabling more effective tumor targeting and elimination. However, recent clinical setbacks since 2021 have raised concerns about ISACs' viability as ADC successors. Although ISAC development remains early-stage, clinical trials have revealed significant challenges, including limited efficacy, systemic toxicity (eg, cytokine release syndrome), and anti-drug antibody generation. Current strategies to overcome these hurdles focus on optimizing payload selection (eg, toll-like receptor 7(TLR7) vs stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists), improving linker stability, and exploring localized delivery methods. While ISACs face substantial translational barriers, their potential to synergize with existing immunotherapies and treat \"cold\" tumors maintains therapeutic promise. Further refinement of design parameters may ultimately position ISACs as a transformative oncology modality.",

We estimated local genetic correlation (r<sub>g</sub>) for each disease pair using local analysis of (co)variant association (Bonferroni-corrected p value<0.05) and identified genetic variants jointly associated with both diseases using pleiotropy-informed false discovery rate (conjunctional false discovery rate <0.05).

We identified significant r<sub>g</sub> (ranging from -0.50 to 0.84) across 16 loci, with half located in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region, for the disease pairs of IIM and B cell lymphoma subtypes. Furthermore, jointly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms were predominantly found in the HLA region. Specifically, all disease pairs showed shared genetic susceptibility in the HLA class I regions, while additional correlations in class III and class II regions were specific to DM and PM disease pairs, respectively. For some non-HLA loci with significant r<sub>g</sub>, functional analyses revealed immune-related responses potentially overlapping between DM and FL, DM and CLL, and PM and CLL. We revealed that DM and PM share genetic susceptibility with common B cell lymphoma subtypes in both immune-related loci and loci with unclear biological functions.

(3) The metabolites of A2780 and A2780-NiraR cells were analyzed by non-target metabolomics. Forty-four differential metabolites between A2780 and A2780-NiraR cells were screened using the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model, the majority of which were significantly increased, such as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, L-lysine and 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the arginine metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism were the most significantly enriched pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> A2780-NiraR cells have acquired a stable niraparib resistance phenotype, and metabolic pathways including arginine metabolism may serve as potential therapeutic targets for enhancing niraparib efficacy in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effectiveness and safety of secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who progressed after first-line maintenance therapy with poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). <b>Methods:</b> Clinical pathological data and prognostic information were retrospectively collected from 30 ovarian cancer patients who underwent SCS between January 2018 and June 2024. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the second progression-free survival (PFS2) time and 3-year overall survival (OS) rate. <b>Results:</b> (1) Primary treatment: the median age at diagnosis was 51.3 years. A total of 40% (12/30) patients underwent primary debulking surgery with an expectation of achieving no gross residual disease (R0), while 60% (18/30) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 93% (28/30) of patients. BRCA1/2 gene testing was performed in 29 patients (testing rate 97%, 29/30), identifying 11 BRCA-mutated (37%, 11/30) and 18 BRCA wild-type (60%, 18/30) patients. The median duration of PARPi maintenance therapy among the 30 patients was 11.9 months; patients with BRCA gene mutations had a median duration of 19.2 months, while those with BRCA wild-type had a median duration of 10.1 months. (2) Secondary surgery: pathologically confirmed recurrence patterns, single lesion in 9 patients (30%, 9/30), oligo-lesion (2 lesions) in 3 patients (10%, 3/30), and multi-lesion (≥3 lesions) in 18 patients (60%, 18/30). Among the 30 patients, optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 97% (29/30) of SCS patients, with suboptimal cytoreduction in 1 patient (3%, 1/30). Adjuvant chemotherapy included platinum+paclitaxel in 24 (80%, 24/30) patients and platinum+liposomal doxorubicin in 6 (20%, 6/30) patients. PARPi re-treatment was administered to 17 patients (57%, 17/30) after chemotherapy. (3) Efficacy and safety: as of the follow-up cutoff in June 2024, the median follow-up time was 28.0 months. A total of 19 (63%, 19/30) patients experienced the next recurrence. The median PFS2 time after SCS was 18.5 months. Recurrence occurred in 7 BRCA-mutated and 12 BRCA gene wild-type patients. Median PFS2 time was significantly longer in BRCA-mutated patients compared to BRCA wild-type patients (25.7 vs 14.1 months; <i>P</i>=0.028). Three deaths occurred during follow-up, resulting in a 3-year OS rate of 90%. Among the 30 patients, postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients (13%, 4/30). One patient developed a ureteral fistula on 7 days post-SCS requiring ureteral stenting, and one patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on 1 day post-SCS due to hypovolemic shock. No deaths occurred within 30 days after SCS. <b>Conclusion:</b> For platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients progressed after first-line PARPi maintenance therapy who are anticipated to achieve R0 resection, SCS represents a safe and effective second-line treatment option.",

On general examination, she was febrile (temperature 100.4°F) and had enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, along with multiple nodules on the scalp and upper back. At baseline, ocular examination revealed visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and hand movements close to the face in the left eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left eye. The Hirschberg test revealed left esotropia (15°<sup>°</sup>) with an abduction deficit, suggestive of left sixth cranial nerve paresis. Fundus examination was unremarkable. A provisional diagnosis of left orbital apex syndrome (OAS) was made. A comprehensive work-up in neurology and dermatology was performed. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbit suggested an asymmetrically enhancing lesion of the cavernous sinus, soft tissue involvement of the left orbital apex and a nodule involving the white matter of the left parietal lobe. Hormone analysis suggested a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. Fine needle aspiration cytology of a submandibular lymph node and nodules of the scalp and upper back was suggestive of metastatic mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma. Tumour marker analysis revealed raised CEA and CA 125. Further, a positron emission tomography scan revealed active lesions in the lungs with multiorgan spread, supporting the diagnosis of primary lung carcinoma with disseminated metastases manifesting as OAS. In view of the poor prognosis, the patient refused further treatment and succumbed to her condition 1 month following her diagnosis.This case highlights the importance of recognising subtle ocular signs, as they can be indicative of underlying life-threatening conditions. Early detection and thorough investigation of such symptoms are crucial, as they can lead to the identification of serious systemic diseases, such as metastatic cancer, that may otherwise be overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Lagerstroemia speciosa is traditionally used for treating diabetes and inflammation; however, its anticancer potential remains unexplored. This study assesses the antioxidant and anticancer activities of L. speciosa bark extract, with a focus on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells in mice. The crude methanol extract (CME) was subdivided into n-hexane (NHF), chloroform (CHF), ethyl acetate (EAF), and aqueous (AQF) fractions. In vitro antioxidant assays identified CHF as the most active fraction, exhibiting high phenolic and flavonoid content. CHF and EAF were further investigated for anticancer activity in an EAC-induced mouse model, where CHF significantly (P < 0.05) reduced tumor cell count compared to EAF. Phytochemical characterization using FTIR and GC-MS revealed bioactive compounds, including 9-Methoxybicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene and 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (E,E). Molecular docking studies demonstrated strong interactions between these compounds and key cancer-related proteins, p53 and Topoisomerase-II, suggesting potential anticancer mechanisms. Overall, this study shows that L. speciosa bark extract has therapeutic potential, especially for CHF. Bioactive compounds like 9,12-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (E,E) and 9-methoxybicyclo [6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene contribute to the extract's antioxidant and anticancer effects in EAC models, possibly by modulating p53 and Topoisomerase-II.",

Among the various factors influencing the progress and treatment of cancers, the human microbiota plays a vital role. The current analysis explores the role of microbial metabolites in various regulatory pathways associated with cancer biomarkers and finds the common microbial metabolites associated with HSCs. AR, ESR1, and TP53 in breast cancer; ERBB2, MAPK21, and TP53 in ovarian cancer; AKT1, EGFR, and ERBB2 in endometrial cancer and AR, MYC, and RB1 in prostate cancer were identified as important genes in HSC development. The associated metabolites of these genes were contributing to various regulatory pathways. The metabolites hydrogen peroxide, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, guanosine diphosphate, and guanosine triphosphate produced by microbes within the humans were found to be involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism pathways. The purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway, arginine and proline pathway, and glycine, serine, and threonine pathways were found common and significantly enriched between human and microbial metabolites showing close association between the microbial metabolites and the HSCs. The microbes belonging to Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes phylum were found to be significantly associated with HSCs. The expression analysis and the similar pathways enriched between the correlated genes and hub genes validated the significance of the metabolites which can be used as potential biomarkers. Thus, the metabolic biomarkers can help in early diagnosis, targeted therapy based on the microbiome, and in prevention of cancer.",

In this study, we aim to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causality between immune cells, pulmonary diseases and plasma metabolites. We analyzed immune cells and seven pulmonary diseases, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung cancer, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), and tuberculosis (TB), using genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) data for immune cells as an exposure factor and seven lung diseases as outcomes. Plasma metabolites GWAS data served as mediators. We applied MR analysis to explore the relationship between immune cells and pulmonary diseases, followed by two-step mediation analysis to identify potential metabolites that may mediate this association. As shown in the results, immune cells contribute to disease progression by reducing the protective effect of metabolites on disease or enhancing the promoting effect of metabolites on disease. These include CD4/CD8br and lung cancer, CD62L-CD86+ myeloid DC AC and Pneumonia, and Naive DN (CD4-CD8-) %T cell and COPD. On the other hand, immune cells suppress disease by increasing the inhibitory effect of metabolites on disease or decreasing the promoting effect of metabolites on disease, These include CD39 on CD39+ CD8br and ILD, CD28+ CD45RA+ CD8br AC and TB, Activated & secreting Treg AC and SAS, HLA DR on DC and IPF.

This study included 63 Egyptian HCC patients, 55 % of whom had a history of HCV infection. Using a paired sampling strategy, approximately 2800 COSMIC mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes were NGS sequenced. Total of 381 somatic mutations were identified, 91 mutations detected in the HCC group and 291 in the HCV-related HCC group. The top 10 mutated genes in the non-HCV group were TP53, ATM, EGFR, CDH1, FGFR1, MET, SMAD4, ERBB2, FLT3, and FBXW7, while in the HCV-related HCC group, genes were KIT, ATM, TP53, APC, FBXW7, KDR, RB1, SMAD4, EGFR, and PIK3CA. The present study represents the first comprehensive somatic mutation profile in HCC Egyptian patients.

Natural compounds, particularly those derived from marine sources, present a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the potential of Chlorella vulgaris, a unicellular green alga with a rich profile of bioactive compounds, as a source of anti-inflammatory agents. Through in silico molecular docking and dynamics simulations, we identified compounds C8 and C4 as potent inhibitors of COX-1 and NIK, key targets in inflammatory pathways. These compounds demonstrated significantly stronger binding affinities than standard inhibitors MXM and OWC. For COX-1, C8 and C4 showed binding affinities of -8.625 and -4.359 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to -3.454 kcal/mol for MXM. Similarly, for NIK, the binding affinities were -6.798 and -3.789 kcal/mol for C8 and C4, respectively, compared to -2.628 kcal/mol for OWC. Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrated that C8 and C4 formed stable interactions, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, with key residues in the active sites of COX-1 and NIK, suggesting a potential for sustained inhibitory activity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of C. vulgaris derived compounds for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Although further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to fully elucidate their efficacy and safety, these results provide a promising foundation for the development of novel, naturally sourced anti-inflammatory therapies.",

Our study aims to find prospective biomarkers that could serve as prognostic indicators and help in the identification of efficient drug candidates for KIRC treatment. Importantly, this study identifies the hub genes that play a crucial role in KIRC and their impact on male and female patients. The cBioPortal was used to identify frequently mutated genes across seven KIRC studies. Additionally, GSE168845 was employed to identify the differentially expressed genes. The analysis revealed that the titin (TTN) gene was mutated and upregulated in KIRC. Subsequently, differential genes of wild-type TTN versus mutant TTN were identified using TNMplot. The NetworkAnalyst tool was used to conduct KEGG analysis and PPI analysis on these genes. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier Plotter was utilized to perform overall survival analysis. Our findings indicated that the TTN gene leads to poorer prognosis in women than in men. We also discovered that the female-specific prolactin signaling pathway plays a significant role in the progression of KIRC. Moreover, our study suggested that the GDF15 gene, involved in the prolactin signaling pathway, has a worse prognosis for KIRC in women than in men. Additionally, mRNA expression analysis showed a negative correlation between GDF15 and MAPK14 in KIRC. Collectively, our research indicates that TTN, GDF15, and MAPK14 can serve as prognostic biomarkers in female KIRC patients, offering prospects for enhanced treatment and patient outcomes in these cancers.",

The presence of a high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HNSCC tumors was shown to be associated with improved clinical outcomes. One-time autologous TIL cell therapy was evaluated in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. C-145-03 (NCT03083873) was a phase 2 study of TIL in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC assigned to 1 of 4 treatment cohorts: cohort 1, non-cryopreserved TIL; cohort 2, cryopreserved lifileucel (22-day manufacturing); cohort 3, cryopreserved lifileucel (16-day manufacturing); cohort 4, cryopreserved LN-145-S1 programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) selected. Patients underwent tumor resection for TIL generation. After preparative non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, patients received a single infusion of TIL followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) infusion(s). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1. Secondary endpoints were investigator-assessed duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Overall, 53 patients received TIL: cohort 1 (n=8), cohort 2 (n=17), cohort 3 (n=16), cohort 4 (n=12). Median age was 57 years and most patients were males (87%; 46/53) with stage IV disease (98%; 52/53). Patients had a median of two prior lines of systemic therapy; 87% (46/53) of patients had prior anti-PD-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 therapy and 72% (38/53) had prior chemotherapy. The ORR was 11% (6/53) with six patients achieving partial response (cohort 1, n=3; cohort 2, n=1; cohort 4, n=2). At median follow-up of 17.9 months, the median DOR was 7.6 months.

The subcapsular location of a TN may strengthen the indication for FNAC as, in TN resulting malignant at cytology may favor surgery rather than active surveillance. However, the definition of a subcapsular TN remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the interobserver agreement (IOA) among thyroid US experts in classifying TNs as subcapsular or not. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Twelve raters received an electronic link to a file containing static US images and were asked to assess 60 TNs for subcapsular location, blinded to all other TN characteristics. The overall IOA was calculated, and the TN US features were subsequently analyzed to evaluate their potential influence on interobserver variability. The raters had high or very high thyroid US experience. Two experienced operators preliminarily selected the case series and analyzed the findings. All cases were derived from patients undergoing surgery and histological diagnosis. The IOA was calculated according to Fleiss' kappa, ranging from 0.0 (no agreement) to 1.0 (perfect agreement). <b><i>Results:</i></b> The overall IOA was fair (κ = 0.34), with a slightly better result in the subgroup of raters with higher experience (κ = 0.39). A higher IOA value (κ = 0.38) was observed in TNs of medium size. Following multiple sub-analyses, the highest κ value (0.46) was observed in the subgroup of TNs that were categorized as EU-TIRADS 5 and were smaller than 2 cm. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The overall IOA among US experts when assessing TNs as subcapsular was unsatisfactory. A clear and standardized definition of subcapsular position is needed to improve clinical decision-making. Future guidelines should address this issue to ensure consistent assessment and management of subcapsular TNs.",

    "abstract": "Urinary homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) are widely used diagnostic markers for neuroblastoma, but urinary markers for risk assessment prior to invasive biopsy are lacking. We hypothesized that cystathionine (CTN) may be a new neuroblastoma biomarker and evaluated its utility for diagnosis and pretreatment risk assessment. 80 participants provided 202 urine samples: 32 from 32 control participants, 29 from 29 patients with primary neuroblastoma, and 141 from 30 patients with residual tumors, 11 of whom had primary neuroblastoma. Urinary CTN and HVA/VMA concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic and pretreatment risk assessment performance according to the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) pretreatment risk classification and the revised 2021 Children's Oncology Group (COG) neuroblastoma risk classification. Associations with prognostic factors were also evaluated. The AUC values for diagnosis were 0.920, 0.903, and 0.946 for HVA, VMA, and CTN, respectively. For pretreatment risk assessment (high-risk versus intermediate- and low-risk, and high- and intermediate-risk versus low-risk) the AUCs according to the INRG classification were 0.576 and 0.578 for HVA, 0.524 and 0.513 for VMA, and 0.852 and 0.708 for CTN, respectively, whereas they were 0.530 and 0.741 for HVA, 0.510 and 0.796 for VMA, and 0.758 and 0.981 for CTN, respectively, according to the COG classification. The values for MYCN status were 0.844 for HVA, 0.844 for VMA, and 0.942 for CTN. CTN may be a useful urinary marker for neuroblastoma diagnosis and pretreatment risk assessment.",

We sought to explore the feasibility of the new clip applier in robotic urologic surgery and compare it with the standard Weck® laparoscopic Hem-o-lok® clip applier. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A retrospective review of 100 consecutive robotic urologic surgeries completed using the new clip applier by two surgeons was conducted from August 2024 to January 2025. The surgeries performed were robotic radical prostatectomy (RALP), robotic radical nephrectomy (RARN), and robotic partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Clips were applied during pelvic lymph node dissection in RALP, during ureteral transection in RARN, and during renorrhaphy in RAPN. Both ArtiSential (Group 1) and Hem-o-lok (Group 2) clips were applied during similar portions of the cases, with the latter group acting as a control. The number of successfully deployed clips (no misfires) was recorded and compared between groups. Subjective surgeon and bedside assistant approval was assessed using a dichotomous scale of yes/no for correct clip application. Cognitive load for the bedside assistant using the ArtiSential clip applier was measured using the NASA task load index (TLX). <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 340 clips in Group 1 and 360 clips in Group 2 were used. The percent of successful deployments of clips in Group 1 was 97.1% (330/340), while in Group 2 it was 94.4% (340/360) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Subjective bedside assistant assessment of clip application was 91.2% accuracy in Group 1 (301/330 clips) and 87.6% accuracy in Group 2 (298/340 clips). Subjective surgeon assessment of clip application was 89.1% in Group 1 (294/330 clips) and 83.2% in Group 2 (283/340 clips). The mean NASA-TLX was significantly higher in Group 1 compared with Group 2. There was one reported lymphocele in Group 2. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The ArtiSential clip applier is a double-jointed, multi-articulating laparoscopic clip applier that allows for improved accuracy of clip application when compared to standard Weck Hem-o-lok clip appliers in pelvic and retroperitoneal robotic urologic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic hepatic resection requires precise surgical skills. The sheep liver, closely resembling the human liver, emerges as a promising alternative for the advanced laparoscopic hepatic resection model. We aim to assess the suitability of the sheep liver as an animal training model for advanced laparoscopic hepatic surgery and identify potential limitations. This study, conducted at the 20th MESDA Conference in Bangkok on September 23-24, 2022, involved 10 sheep undergoing laparoscopic liver surgery training. Pre-training CT scans identified liver structures after general anesthesia administration. In groups of three, trainees performed live laparoscopic hepatic surgery on anesthetized sheep, with immediate feedback collected through post-training questionnaires assessing the clinical impact on live sheep models. 3D reconstructions revealed that 30% of sheep exhibited human-like ramification in the right portal vein (RPV), while 70% showed independent bifurcation patterns. The left portal vein (LPV) is consistently bifurcated into left medial and lateral sectoral branches, mimicking human anatomy. Hepatic vein drainage showed uniformity, with the right hepatic vein (RHV) forming a common trunk (MHV-like) before draining into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The participant's success rate was high, with 80.0% finding sheep model procedures realistic. Organ and tissue properties received high ratings, with 66.7% very high, 30.0% high, and 3.3% intermediate. Feasibility for advanced laparoscopic liver surgery on sheep models was very high (80.0%) and high (20.0%); overall, 76.7% rated laparoscopic liver surgery training very high in learning success. This study underscores the effectiveness of sheep liver as a suitable model for advanced laparoscopic hepatic resection training. Further research is needed to assess the model's effectiveness and limitations in specific laparoscopic hepatic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recently, opportunities for women to assume active roles are expanding, but it is noteworthy that the representation of female surgeons remains still low. As minimally invasive surgery penetrates, physical limitations such as muscle strength are diminishing. This evolution reduces obstacles and enhances the potential to widen opportunities for female surgeons to actively work. This study retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes of patients who received laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) (2013-2023) performed by resident surgeons as a primary operator. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether the primary surgeon was female or male. Perioperative outcomes and prognosis were examined after propensity score matching (PSM). Overall, 417 patients were eligible, and 24 resident surgeons operated, 7 female (29%) and 17 male (71%). After PSM, 107 patients were extracted for each group. No significant differences were observed in patients' baseline. Operation time (225 vs. 221 min), intraoperative blood loss (10 vs. 14 g), and postoperative hospital stay (8 vs. 8 days) did not differ. The incidence of postoperative complications (all-grade) was 9% vs. 18%. The calculated risk ratio of the female surgeons was 0.53 (95% confidence intervals: 0.26-1.08) (p = 0.08), which upper limit was lower than the prespecified non-inferior margin (1.2), thus the non-inferiority was proved. We found no gender difference in clinical outcomes of LDG performed by resident surgeons. The results of this study help us understand the role of female surgeons and encourage women to apply for surgical positions in the future.",

This study evaluates the additional therapeutic value of drugs approved by Health Canada through Project Orbis. The FDA list of drugs approved through Project Orbis until the end of 2024 was downloaded and drugs that Health Canada participated in were identified. The type of approval that Health Canada gave these drugs - standard, priority and Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c, conditional approval) was identified. The additional therapeutic value of the drugs (major, moderate and minor) was assessed from the ratings of four international organizations. The distribution of additional therapeutic value (minor, moderate, major) according to review type was compared using a Chi-square test. The FDA approved 68 drugs for 112 indications of which 49 (72.1%) drugs were reviewed by Health Canada for 78 (69.6%) indications (30 new drugs and 48 new indications for existing drugs). The manufacturer withdrew one drug from the approval process leaving 77 new drugs and new indications for analysis. Twenty-eight drugs had a standard review, 31 a priority review and 18 a NOC/c review. The distribution of additional therapeutic value by review type was statistically significantly different, p = 0.0052 (Chi-square test). Sixteen (69.6%) out of 23 drugs with a priority review offered either moderate (10) or major (6) additional therapeutic gains. Only 12 of the remaining 40 drugs with a therapeutic evaluation that had other types of approval had moderate or major additional therapeutic value. The results of this study suggest that Health Canada's participation in Project Orbis should concentrate on drugs that qualify for a priority review.",

Evidence on this association remains scarce. This retrospective study examined irradiated HNC patients treated at a German university hospital between 2007 and 2022, with follow-up until December 2024. The predictor variables were JR and ND, with JORN as the main outcome. Appropriate statistics were computed with a significance level of P ≤ 0.005. Of 510 subjects (22.9% female; mean age 61.8±11.1 years [range, 14-92]), 14.7% developed JORN. JR and ND significantly increased JORN occurrence (75/510; P < 0.0001; odds ratio [OR], 3.67 [95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-6.65]; number needed to harm [NNH], 7.05; post hoc power, 99.7%).

JORN rates rose from 6.7% with HNR alone to 16.5-42.9% with additional JR and/or ND. JR increases the likelihood of JORN by up to 16% compared with HNR alone. Approximately one in seven irradiated HNC patients with ablative surgery develops JORN (NNH, 7.05).

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) must effectively communicate their uncertainty to be viable in clinical settings. As such, the need for reliable uncertainty estimation grows increasingly urgent with the expanding use of LLMs for information extraction from electronic health records. Previous token-level uncertainty estimators have only used token probabilities within a single output sequence. Here, by leveraging the constraints of JSON output structure, we instead consider all likely sequences and their respective probabilities to obtain a more robust measure of model confidence. We develop Certainty Retrieval Token Search (CeRTS), a new uncertainty estimator for structured information extraction. We evaluated CeRTS against a previous gold-standard uncertainty estimator when extracting clinical features from lung cancer discharge summaries across eight open-source LLMs. Calibration (Brier score) and discrimination (AUROC) were used to quantify performance. CeRTS surpassed the previous gold-standard estimator in discriminatory power across every model and achieved better calibration in most cases. CeRTS had the strongest agreement between model confidence and accuracy with Qwen-2.5. CeRTS enhances LLM-based information extraction from unstructured clinical text by assigning well-calibrated confidence scores to each extracted item, providing medical researchers with a quantitative measure of reliability at minimal additional cost. Although its performance was generally robust, CeRTS struggled with DeepSeek-R1, which we attribute to the model's Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps. Our evaluation focused on clinical data, but CeRTS can be applied to any domain requiring reliable uncertainty estimation.",

RNA-binding motif single-stranded interacting protein 2 (RBMS2) has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in CRC and its involvement with ferroptosis remains poorly understood. This study explores the involvement of RBMS2 in CRC development and its potential as a therapeutic target. Functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell migration, invasion assays, and EMT-related gene determination, were conducted to evaluate the effects of RBMS2 overexpression and knockdown. Ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy were assessed using specific inhibitors, ferroptosis inducers, and apoptosis and proliferation detection. The interaction between RBMS2 and SLC7A11 was explored during the ferroptosis process. In vivo experiments involved xenograft models in nude mice to observe tumor growth, EMT, and metastasis. Overexpression of RBMS2 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, RBMS2 promoted ferroptosis by downregulating SLC7A11. Mechanistic studies revealed that RBMS2 destabilizes SLC7A11 at the mRNA level. In vivo, RBMS2 overexpression significantly suppressed tumor growth and lung/liver metastasis. Our findings indicate that RBMS2 inhibits CRC progression by promoting ferroptosis and regulating SLC7A11 mRNA stability. Targeting the RBMS2-SLC7A11 axis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC.",

Innovative and efficient methods of treating and preventing cancer has become expedient since its incidence rates are rising globally. Combining herbal extracts and chemotherapy have drawn a lot of attention in recent times as a cutting-edge cancer prevention approach. The wild parasitic plant Loranthus micranthus is extensively distributed throughout the world and is well-known for its therapeutic uses. Previous preclinical investigations indicated that the leaves and stem extracts of L. micranthus had the potential to suppress breast cancer. Investigating the anticancer effects of L. micranthus extracts through network pharmacology analysis, in vitro and in vivo experiments is the goal of the current study. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 207 targets and 30 bioactive phytoconstituents of L. micranthus associated with the metabolism of breast cancer. L. micranthus controlled the metabolism of tryptophan and nitrogen in breast cancer, according to KEGG analysis and in silico models. The results of the experiment showed that L. micranthus significantly reduced the synthesis of kynurenine in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated breast cancer cells, downregulated important proteins involved in tryptophan catabolism, and produced no cytotoxic effects in human breast cancer cells (MCF 7 and MDA-MB 231) at the administered doses. The viability of T cells co-cultured with IFN-γ-treated breast cancer cells was also markedly enhanced by L. micranthus pre-treatment. The in vivo investigation showed a similar outcome, with L. micranthus treatment suppressing the inflammatory response, IDO activity/expression, lowering kynurenine levels, blocking CTLA-4 immune checkpoint and finally increasing the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in rats with DMBA-induced breast cancer.",

Neuroblastomas (NB) are the most common extracranial tumors in children, accounting for approximately 10% of all pediatric malignancies. Around half of NB cases are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the ALK gene. In this study, we selected the SH-SY5Y cell line as an in vitro model of human neuroblastoma to investigate the potential use of IAA as an effective anti-proliferative agent. First, we examined the effects of IAA on SH-SY5Y cells and, in parallel, on non-cancerous ARPE-19 retinal pigment epithelial cells, assessing cell viability. We found that IAA treatment consistently reduced cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells. This reduction in viability was accompanied by a stronger inhibition of ALK expression in SH-SY5Y cells compared to ARPE-19 cells. Next, we evaluated the impact of IAA treatment on cell cycle progression and autophagy. Our results revealed that IAA induces a dose-dependent G1 arrest within 24 h of exposure and upregulates key autophagy-related proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, IAA treatment inhibited colony formation and cell migration in SH-SY5Y cells, even at the lowest concentration. Altogether, our findings indicate that IAA exerts anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting cell viability and ALK expression, cell cycle progression, and suppressing colony formation and migration, with minimal impact on non-cancerous ARPE-19 cells. However, additional mechanisms may contribute to its activity. Further studies in different cellular contexts are needed to clarify its clinical potential and therapeutic relevance in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ampelopsis grossedentata (AG) is a popular folk tea that has been used in China for more than 1000 years. It is noteworthy that AG is widely recognized for preventing alcohol hangover in folk, and its protective effects on alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis have been demonstrated. Alcohol overconsumption can induce acute duodenal injury (ADI) that lacks effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the gastrointestinal protective effects of AG on alcoholic ADI in mice. AG extract was chemically characterized by HPLC analysis. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were pre-administered AG extract via gavage, and then subjected to an ethanol-induced ADI. After treatment, duodenal tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence. Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify the differentially expressed metabolites, and the gene expressions of duodenal tissues were determined using RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Acute ethanol administration caused severe duodenal damage, characterized by necrosis and shedding of duodenal villi, hemorrhagic injury, mucosal edema, and disruption of intestinal barrier in mice, which was improved by the pre-treatment with AG extract. Notably, administration of AG aqueous extract suppressed ethanol-induced duodenal villous apoptosis in mice by inhibiting caspase-3/7. In addition, untargeted metabolomics data showed AG extract improved ethanol-induced disruption of amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, and increased the levels of amino acids, such as L-serine, L-histidine, L-leucine, L-glutamine and L-tryptophan. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ethanol intake activated TNF, IL-17, MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and these pathways were inhibited by AG extract pre-treatment. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry results showed AG extract reduced the expressions of TNF-a, FADD, TRADD, RIPK1 and caspase-8 activity in duodenal tissue in ethanol-fed mice. In addition, western blotting data showed that pre-treatment with AG extract suppressed ethanol-induced activation of IL-17 and MAPK pathways. In conclusion, pre-treatment with AG inhibited ethanol-induced apoptosis of duodenal villi, disruption of intestinal barrier and amino acids metabolic disturbance. AG extract inhibited the TNF-a/FADD/caspase-8 and IL-17/MAPK signaling pathways. These findings highlight the gastrointestinal protective effects of AG extract against alcoholic ADI, and support its application as a duodenal protectant in drug development and dietary supplements.",

Patients were grouped based on baseline disease characteristics (high-volume/HV or low-volume/LV) and PSA levels at 6 months (<0.2 ng/mL vs. ≥0.2 ng/mL). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate correlation of PSA nadir with overall survival (OS) adjusted for treatment arm, disease volume, Gleason score, and prior local therapy. Of 790 patients, 225 were without recorded death after a median follow-up of 10 years. The 10-year OS was 25.9% (ADT+D) vs. 22.5% (ADT; HR: 0.78; p=0.004). HV patients treated with docetaxel had significantly higher OS (20.9% vs. 11.4%; p<0.0001). PSA <0.2 ng/mL at 6 months was associated with improved median OS in both ADT+D (100.3 vs. 45.4 months; p<0.0001) and ADT (116.8 vs. 31.8 months; p<0.0001) arms. PSA nadir <0.2 at 6 months was an independent predictor of improved OS (HR: 0.41; p<0.0001) adjusting for disease volume, prior local therapy, gleason score and treatment arm. Long-term follow-up confirms that ADT+D significantly improves OS in mHSPC patients with in HV disease. PSA nadir <0.2 ng/mL at 6 months is a strong prognostic marker for OS, supporting its use in response-adapted de-escalation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES) consists of dispersed neuroendocrine (NE) cells that bridge nervous, immune, and endocrine pathways across organs. Evolutionarily, DNES traces to primitive metazoans where single cells combined neural and immune roles, later diversifying into specialized vertebrate NE cells. Hallmark traits include dense-core granules, amine metabolism, \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, and regulation by ASCL1, NEUROG3, and INSM1. Remarkable plasticity allows immune and epithelial cells to acquire NE features under stress, while carcinomas exploit this program to form aggressive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and resist therapy. Canonical neuroimmune circuits, the Vagus-driven inflammatory reflex and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis, illustrate DNES coordination of systemic responses. Clinically, DNES-derived neoplasms span multiple organs, produce diverse hormonal syndromes, and are managed with somatostatin analogues, epigenetic drugs, and emerging immunotherapies. Recognizing DNES as a diffuse, integrative regulatory network clarifies mechanisms of chronic inflammation and cancer evolution and offers novel therapeutic entry points for disorders ranging from asthma to pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.",

Contours for 31 OARs generated by the software were compared to clinical contours using multiple accuracy metrics, including: Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 Percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95), surface DSC, as well as relative added path length (RAPL) as an efficiency metric. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to quantify variability in contouring accuracy across software platforms (inter-software) and patients (inter-patient). Pairwise comparisons were performed to categorize the software into different performance groups, and inter-software variations (ISV) were calculated as the average performance differences between the groups. Significant inter-software and inter-patient contouring accuracy variations (p<0.05) were observed for most OARs. The largest ISV in DSC in each anatomical region were cervical esophagus (0.41), trachea (0.10), spinal cord (0.13) and prostate (0.17). Among the organs evaluated, 7 had mean DSC >0.9 (i.e., heart, liver), 15 had DSC ranging from 0.7 to 0.89 (i.e., parotid, esophagus). The remaining organs (i.e., optic nerves, seminal vesicle) had DSC<0.7. 16 of the 31 organs (52%) had RAPL less than 0.1. Our results reveal significant inter-software and inter-patient variability in the performance of AI-segmentation software. These findings highlight the need of thorough software commissioning, testing, and quality assurance across disease sites, patient-specific anatomies and image acquisition protocols.",

    "title": "Geographic access to radiotherapy services in Canada.",
    "abstract": "The vast geography and sparse population of Canada pose substantial challenges to delivering radiotherapy services. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to characterize the geographic accessibility of radiotherapy in Canada and investigate where future radiotherapy facilities can be optimally located. Demographic and human geographic data were extracted from the 2021 Canadian Census for 57,937 dissemination areas (geographically stable regions of approximately 500-700 persons), and active facilities providing megavoltage external beam radiotherapy were located using national and international directories. Logistic regression models were then used to analyze demographic factors associated with poor access to radiotherapy, defined as the absence of radiotherapy facilities within a 2-hour one-way driving radius. To inform planning efforts, we evaluated the impact of constructing a new radiotherapy facility in each dissemination area using multiple metrics of geographic access. The median driving time of the Canadian population to their nearest radiotherapy facility was 22.8 minutes. A total of 3,445,472 persons (9.3%) had poor access to radiotherapy in Canada, with significant variations by province (range, 4-48%). Seniors over age 65, males, low-income individuals, internal migrants within Canada, and Indigenous people had higher odds of experiencing poor access to radiotherapy. In contrast, visible minorities, immigrants to Canada, and individuals with post-secondary education had lower odds of experiencing poor access. We identified eight locations across Canada where a new radiotherapy facility could achieve change-in-access metrics comparable or superior to those of recently opened facilities; establishing new facilities at all eight locations could reduce the population with poor access by 1,127,127 (32.7%). We found significant geographic and demographic disparities in access to radiotherapy across Canada. This study provides evidence that additional radiotherapy facilities are required to address existing inequities and better serve vulnerable populations, and the potential locations for new facilities that we identified can guide stakeholders in planning these expansions.",

    "abstract": "The LungART trial randomized NSCLC patients with N2 disease to adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiotherapy. They found that patients who received radiotherapy had reduced overall survival and claimed that heart dose was the etiological factor, though without offering proof. Consequently, we evaluated cardiac dose and overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for N2 disease. 155 patients comprised the final cohort, all treated for N2 disease. Cox proportional hazards testing for OS was performed across a wide range of clinical variables. Additionally, we evaluated factors that impacted cardiac dose. We performed multivariable analysis (MVA) using elastic net survival regression. We tuned the model's hyperparameters with Bayesian methods and conducted a variable importance analysis on the resultant model. Lastly, we analyzed relevant features after correcting for multiple comparisons. The internal target volume (ITV)/lung volume ratio was overwhelmingly the most important variable, although chemoradiotherapy sequencing played a small role. Cardiac dose significantly increased with increasing tumor volume and involvement of \"peri-cardial\" lymph node stations (4R/L and/or stations 7-12). After incorporating these factors, no cardiac dosimetric variables remained significant. Cardiac dosimetric variables did not impact upon OS in MVA. OS was overwhelmingly determined by the ITV/lung ratio. Furthermore, increasing cardiac dose was directly impacted by increasing tumor volume, number of \"pericardial\" lymph node stations involved, and/or treatment of hilar lymph nodes, all of which are eponymous for increasing tumor stage.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting pseudoprogression (PsP) from tumor progression (TuP) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is crucial for treatment and prognosis. This study develops a deep learning (DL) prognostic model using pre- and post-operative contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to forecast the likelihood of PsP or TuP following standard GBM treatment. Brain MRI data and clinical characteristics from 110 GBM patients were divided into a training set (n = 68) and a validation set (n = 42). Pre-operative and post-operative CET1 images were used individually and combined. A Vision Transformer (ViT) model was built using expert-segmented tumor images to extract DL features. Several mainstream convolutional neural network (CNN) models (DenseNet121, Inception_v3, MobileNet_v2, ResNet18, ResNet50, and VGG16) were built for comparative evaluation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression selected the significant features, classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Model performance was evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A multimodal model also incorporated DL features and clinical characteristics. The optimal input for predicting TuP versus PsP was the combination of pre- and post-operative CET1 tumor regions. The CET1-ViT model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.5% and accuracy of 90.7% on the training set, and an AUC of 95.2% and accuracy of 96.7% on the validation set. This model outperformed the mainstream CNN models. The multimodal model showed superior performance, with AUCs of 98.6% and 99.3% on the training and validation sets, respectively. We developed a DL model based on pre- and post-operative CET1 imaging that can effectively forecast PsP versus TuP in GBM patients, offering potential for evaluating treatment responses and early indications of tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated a combined approach of surgical excision with open wound healing and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for periocular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in a 72-year-old male patient, whose lesion involved a high-risk anatomical location due to direct proximity to ocular structures. The patient presented with a 7-year history of progressive periocular BCC involving the medial canthus and nasal root. Given the lesion's proximity to ocular structures, a staged protocol was implemented with three preoperative PDT sessions administered weekly to reduce tumor burden. Gross tumor resection with 1-2 mm margins was then performed, leaving the wound to heal by secondary intention. Immediate postoperative PDT was followed by a second PDT cycle of three weekly sessions. Preoperative PDT achieved significant tumor regression. Surgical excision proceeded with minimal tissue loss. Subsequent histopathology of the specimen revealed positive peripheral margins, retrospectively validating the necessity of the PDT for treating residual disease. No recurrence was observed over a 5-year follow-up, and the healed scar was flat, pliable, and caused no functional or significant cosmetic concern to the patient. The combined approach preserved anatomical integrity and function while avoiding extensive reconstructive surgery risks. It offers a viable alternative to radical excision, balancing oncologic outcomes with functional and cosmetic preservation. Further studies are warranted to optimize protocols for similar anatomically challenging cases.",

Nevertheless, the advancement of research and clinical applications involving this cytokine has been hindered by the constraints associated with the production of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2). This study presents a scalable and robust purification protocol for rhIL-2 derived from inclusion bodies (IBs) in Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that microfiltration-based method could improve the purity of the denatured IBs effectively, and various refolding conditions were assessed to improve the recovery of refolded rhIL-2, resulting in an increase in the refolding yield from 15% to 45%. Subsequently, purification through three-column chromatography could refine the refolded rhIL-2 efficiently. Ultimately, the robustness of the purification process is substantiated by three consecutive scale-up experiments, achieving a productivity of 4 mg rhIL-2/g cell pellets, alongside high product purity and significant product activity.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have confirmed that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is widely expressed in various malignant tumors. However, no systematic study has assessed the expression of IMP3 in bone tumors. We immunohistochemically examined 1,381 bone tumor specimens for IMP3 expression, analyzed its differential expression among various types of bone tumors, and evaluated its potential application in surgical pathology. Our results demonstrated that IMP3 positivity was observed in 7.5% (55/732) of benign bone tumors and 55.2% (358/649) of malignant bone tumors, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001). Notably, higher levels of IMP3 expression were observed in high-grade malignant bone tumors than in their low-grade counterparts. The incidence of IMP3 positivity exceeds 80% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade osteosarcoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Additionally, we detected IMP3 positivity in 63.5% (80/126) of metastatic bone cancers, specifically in 83.6% (46/55) of lung cancers, 70% (7/10) of liver cancers, and 87.5% (7/8) of colorectal cancers. We also observed high levels of IMP3 expression in three benign bone tumor types: chondroblastoma, epithelioid hemangioma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In conclusion, IMP3 immunostaining may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for malignant bone tumors, especially osteosarcoma and lymphoma. The high expression of IMP3 observed in bone metastases of lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer indicates that IMP3 could be associated with bone metastasis in these malignancies. Future research should focus on elucidating the relationship between IMP3 expression and various clinicopathological parameters as well as prognostic outcomes in malignant bone tumors.",

    "abstract": "Although various poor oral health conditions have been reported to be associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk, a comprehensive investigation of the causes of death is limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between poor oral function and mortality due to various causes in older adults. This 7-year follow-up cohort study used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. The participants were independent older adults aged ≥65 years at baseline. The outcome and exposure variables were 10 types of cause-specific mortality and poor oral functioning (chewing difficulty, swallowing problems and xerostomia). Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Among the 44 083 participants (mean age 73.7 years [SD 6.0], men 46.8%), the all-cause mortality was 20.76 per 1000 person-years. After considering all covariates, chewing difficulty was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to neoplasms (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30) and circulatory diseases (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), swallowing problems was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to nervous system diseases (HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47) and respiratory diseases (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.70), and xerostomia was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to nervous system diseases (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.20-2.92), circulatory diseases (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.37) and respiratory diseases (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.58), respectively. The present results suggest that poor oral functioning, including chewing difficulty, swallowing problems and xerostomia, could amplify the risk of mortality due to specific diseases.

We aimed to assess both non-inferiority and superiority of ecnoglutide versus dulaglutide, also a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a 52-week, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 trial at 52 hospitals in China. Adults aged 18-75 years with a BMI of 20-35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy were included. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous ecnoglutide (0·6 mg or 1·2 mg) or dulaglutide (1·5 mg) once weekly. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at week 32 (non-inferiority for ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg, with a 0·4% non-inferiority margin; superiority for ecnoglutide 1·2 mg) and was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (full analysis set). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one safety evaluation after starting treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05680129) and has ended. Between Jan 10 and May 30, 2023, 623 participants were randomly assigned, of whom 621 comprised the full analysis set (mean age 53·9 years [SD 10·1], 347 [56%] males, 274 [44%] females, and mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8·40% [SD 0·78]; 68·28 mmol/mol [8·56]; 206 in the ecnoglutide 0·6 mg group, 208 in the ecnoglutide 1·2 mg group, and 207 in the dulaglutide 1·5 mg group). At week 32, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions were 1·91% (SE 0·05; -20·86 mmol/mol [0·53]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg, 1·89% (0·05; -20·69 mmol/mol [0·54]) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg, and 1·65% (0·05; -18·02 mmol/mol [0·53]) with dulaglutide. Estimated treatment differences versus dulaglutide were -0·26% (95% CI -0·39 to -0·13; -2·84 mmol/mol [-4·29 to -1·38]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and -0·24% (-0·38 to -0·11; -2·67 mmol/mol [-4·14 to -1·20]; p=0·0002 for superiority) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg. HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions were sustained to week 52. During the 52 weeks, six (3%) of 206 patients in the ecnoglutide 0·6 mg group, eight (4%) of 208 patients in the ecnoglutide 1·2 mg group, and six (3%) of 207 patients in the dulaglutide group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Once-weekly ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg were non-inferior to dulaglutide 1·5 mg in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> in adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy. Although the 1·2 mg dose showed statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week 32 than dulaglutide 1·5 mg, the difference was not considered clinically relevant. Both doses of ecnoglutide were well tolerated. These results suggest that ecnoglutide might offer a new treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Hangzhou Sciwind Biosciences.",

    "abstract": "Women with limited English proficiency continue experiencing an unequal cancer burden. Non-White immigrant women present with more advanced breast and cervical cancer than non-Hispanic Whites, attributed to significant cultural barriers as well as low health literacy in attempting to navigate the United States health care system for cancer screening. Community-based Health litEracy-focused intervention for breast and cervical Cancer Control (CHECC-uP) was an in-person, community health worker-led intervention, addressing both cultural and health literacy barriers through health literacy education and follow-up counseling with navigation assistance. The in-person program was tested in a large cluster-randomized trial and yielded high efficacy in promoting mammogram and Papanicolaou test screening in Korean-speaking women. With over 90% of Americans now having online access, the in-person program was adapted to web-based delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the web version of the intervention-e-CHECC-uP. A randomized pilot trial was conducted. A total of 40 women were enrolled and randomized (20 per arm). The study intervention consisted of web-based health literacy education followed by phone counseling with navigation assistance. Study assessments were done at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The study's primary outcomes were cancer screening behaviors verified by medical record review. Upon completion of final study assessments, intervention participants were invited to join postintervention interviews. In total, 34 women (intervention: n=15; control: n=19) completed the assessment at 6 months, yielding a retention rate of 85%. The intervention participants were highly satisfied with e-CHECC-uP with a median rating of 8 on a 10-point scale. Between-group differences in screening rates were 34.6%, 47.9%, and 37.5%, respectively, for completion of the mammogram, Papanicolaou test, and both at 6 months. We achieved a high retention rate and high participant satisfaction. Although the study was not powered for significance testing, the e-CHECC-uP intervention resulted in large group differences across all cancer screening outcomes in the pilot sample. Online technology can help address multiple logistical barriers associated with in-person intervention delivery. Our findings suggest that web-based delivery of CHECC-uP may be used to promote cancer screening among immigrant women with limited English proficiency, as a promising avenue to ultimately reduce health disparities in underserved communities.",

Procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation enable targeted tumour destruction, particularly in inoperable patients with NSCLC or lung metastases. Studies have shown a high level of local tumour control with acceptable complication rates. The combination of imaging and interventional technique significantly improves patient safety and treatment outcomes and offers good results with low complication rates.Overall, CT-guided puncture and ablation are integral components of modern lung cancer diagnostics for primary and secondary lung tumours, while offering a new treatment option and therapy.

This study aims to examine the association between external exposome factors and the risk of HF readmission and all-cause mortality using a data-driven approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from the OneFlorida+ Network, including patients hospitalized for HF (HHF) from 2016 to 2022. A total of 1308 external exposome factors, covering a wide range of SDoH (eg, economic stability, education, health care access, natural and built environments, and social context), were linked to patients' EHR data based on their county-level residential location. Patients were followed for 1 year after their first HHF to capture readmission and mortality events. We applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization to preselect candidate variables, followed by a 2-phase external exposome-wide association study using mixed-effects logistic regression to identify key factors associated with the composite outcome of 1-year HF readmission and mortality.

    "abstract": "In Manitoba, Canada, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery included, but was not limited to, disruption of many routine health care services, and the rapid introduction of both social distancing and virtual care. Little was known about how COVID-19-related changes to cancer care delivery would impact patient satisfaction with care and care coordination. This report aims to present and interpret findings of an online survey of people with oncology-related conditions in Manitoba, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring patient satisfaction and care coordination. A link to an online survey was made available to patients receiving cancer treatment in Manitoba, Canada, between July 31, 2020, and February 28, 2022. The survey included validated patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) for patient satisfaction and care coordination. Analysis included the generation of descriptive statistics and logistic regression, including univariate and multivariate analysis using stepwise model building. The survey results were interpreted using fit theory as a theoretical lens. A total of 203 responses were collected, of which 154 had completed responses for all PREM measures and were included in the analysis. Response rate is estimated at 3.3%-2.0%. The average age was 65 (SD 11.7) years. Most respondents were male (n=79, 52.7%). Most respondents were being treated with curative intent (n=81, 53.6%). The most common type of cancer was breast (n=41, 26.6%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that ages 60-69 years were associated with above average patient satisfaction (OR 2.205, 95% CI 1.045-4.624; P=.04). Age <60 years (OR 0.437, 95% CI 0.204-0.934; P=.03) and European Cooperative Group functional status (ECOG) ≥2 (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.137-0.782; P=.01) were associated with below average patient satisfaction. Age <60 years, ECOG ≥2, and hematological cancer were selected through stepwise multivariate model building, resulting in an explanatory model (R2=0.129) of patient satisfaction. ECOG ≥2 was associated with below-average care coordination (OR 0.357, 95% CI 0.145-0.880; P=.03), and was the only identified predictor of care coordination, with no explanatory multivariate model generated. Fit theory supports that the level of patient satisfaction and care coordination in each population subset inversely reflects a relative level of unmet supportive care need. Survey respondents with poor functional status, those outside the 60-69 years age range, and those with nonhematological malignancies likely experience increased unmet supportive care needs compared with their counterparts. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings reflect transient phenomena related to the COVID-19 pandemic, selection biases associated with the survey method used, or underlying health care delivery inequities.",

We assessed HPV vaccine misperceptions using a 12-item Likert scale in a population health assessment in a large county in California. We validated the scale using exploratory factor analysis and exploratory graph analysis. We further assessed concurrent validity by examining parent report of youth vaccination through weighted logistic regression. The HPV Vaccine Misperceptions scale had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94) and a strong primary dimension. Further, the 12-item scale sum score was associated with increased odds (Odds Ratio<sub>per SD</sub> = 2.09; 95 % Confidence Interval = 1.26-3.45) of age-eligible children being unvaccinated for HPV in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models.

    "abstract": "U2AF2 (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 2), a crucial spliceosome component regulating RNA splicing, plays a dual role in T-cell function and tumorigenesis. This study integrated multi-omics analysis with experimental validation to elucidate the oncogenic mechanisms of U2AF2 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). U2AF2 expression and its clinical significance were analysed using publicly available COAD transcriptomic and clinical datasets. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of COAD tissues and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to assess the association between U2AF2 expression and tumour immune microenvironment composition. The in vitro functional consequences of U2AF2 knockdown on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were evaluated in COAD cell lines (HCT116, HCT8) using specific assays. The results revealed that splicing factors play a key role in viral infection and regulating of T cell function in the CD4<sup>+</sup> cell subsets. U2AF2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated in COAD patients and were strongly associated with poor prognosis. U2AF2 also exhibited high diagnostic efficiency in COAD and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival. Our study also revealed that high U2AF2 expression was significantly correlated with decreased infiltration levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, U2AF2 knockdown significantly inhibited COAD cell proliferation and migration, while promoting apoptosis. We demonstrate U2AF2's dual oncogenic mechanisms, driving malignant transformation through aberrant RNA splicing and fostering immunosuppression by reshaping the tumour immune landscape. These findings establish U2AF2 as a promising novel therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for COAD.",

Inspired by the mechanism of the in vitro AA assay, we identified 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2), a common nitric oxide (NO) probe, as a selective AA reporter. We showed that the chemical oxidation of AA into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) facilitated its reaction with DAF-2 to form a highly fluorescent product. Surprisingly, the DAF-2-DHA adduct exhibits a red-shifted emission spectrum distinguishable from those of DAF-2 alone or its NO-reactive product. This spectral shift enables the differentiation of signals into two channels, SALSA<sup>Verde</sup> (green) and SALSA<sup>Roja</sup> (red-orange), with SALSA<sup>Roja</sup> offering superior sensitivity and minimal NO interference. SALSA is quantitative, with a strong linear correlation between signal intensity and intracellular AA concentration. Using SALSA and CRISPR, we identified SVCT2 as the major AA transporter in a human cell line model. Applying SALSA to immune profiling revealed previously unappreciated heterogeneity in AA levels across immune subsets and developmental stages. Together, these findings establish SALSA as a robust and accessible method for probing AA dynamics at single-cell resolution, with broad potential applications in redox biology, immunology, and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that significantly regulate gene expression, making them crucial in various diseases, including cancer. Leukemias are hematological malignancies marked by the uncontrolled growth of white blood cells in the bone marrow. The dysregulated expression of miRNAs in these malignancies is linked to their progression and prognosis. Identifying key microRNAs can facilitate early diagnosis and expedite treatment and recovery by acting as crucial biomarkers in leukemia progression. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-155 and miR-181, have been linked to leukemia subtypes, influencing disease development and response to therapy. Recently, biosensors have emerged as a notable method for microRNA identification. These analytical devices possess high sensitivity and specificity for detecting biological agents. microRNA biosensors offer a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate approach to diagnosing leukemias. This review explores the design, functionality, and applications of miRNA electrochemical biosensors in detecting leukemia cancer.",

    "abstract": "Isolating and identifying circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood presents a promising avenue for early cancer diagnosis, metastasis prevention, and timely therapeutic intervention. However, most current isolation techniques are costly, labor-intensive, and require complex labeling procedures. To address these problems, this study introduces a cost-effective and fully automated centrifugal microfluidic platform for the label-free separation and subsequent lysis of cancer cells from whole blood samples. The separation unit comprises a Y-shaped inlet, trapezoidal contraction-expansion array (CEA) microchannel, and bifurcated outlet, which collectively enhance the separation efficiency by harnessing four key hydrodynamic forces: the centrifugal force, Coriolis force, inertial lift force, and Dean drag force. Following the separation process, the disc rotation speed is increased to drive the cells through a serpentine mixing channel, where they mix with a lysis buffer and then flow into a collection chamber. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the fluid flow and particle behavior within the separation channel and lysis micromixer. Experiments are then conducted with K562 leukemia cells spiked into blood samples with different hematocrit levels. A peak separation efficiency of 91.8 % is obtained at a disc rotation speed of 2250 rpm. Moreover, the mixing performance reaches 94.8 % at 2750 rpm. The entire sample loading, cell separation, mixing, decanting, and lysis process is completed within two minutes. Thus, the proposed device shows significant potential as a rapid, user-friendly, and scalable solution for point-of-care cancer diagnosis.",

    "title": "Aberrant glycosylation in pulmonary fibrosis: Mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatment opportunities.",
    "abstract": "Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of scar tissue extending beyond the physiological healing process, ultimately leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. In many industrialized countries, fibrosis is a leading cause of mortality, contributing to approximately 45 % of deaths. Despite considerable advances in elucidating its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, current therapeutic strategies remain largely limited to palliative care. Consequently, there is an urgent demand for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the clinical management of fibrosis and the development of effective anti-fibrotic agents. Both clinical observations and experimental models underscore the multifaceted nature of fibrotic disorders, which contributes to the complexity of treatment. Recent investigations have focused on the epigenetic regulation, particularly post-translational modifications (PTMs), in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of fibrosis. PTMs, including glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, induce subtle yet functionally impactful alterations in protein structure and activity. Among these, glycosylation has garnered increasing attention due to its demonstrated therapeutic relevance in various pathological contexts, including cancer, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence now indicates that glycosylation plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of fibrosis. Technological advances in glycomics and glycoproteomics have substantially deepened our understanding of how glycosylation modulates the fibrotic processes. This review focuses on the role of protein glycosylation in pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting distinct glycosylation patterns and enzymatic alterations implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, it explores the potential of glycosylation-based biomarkers and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing its promise for improving clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies in fibrotic pathologies.",

The authors present a pediatric case of an IMSCMN involving the thoracic segment of the spinal cord. An 11-year-old previously healthy girl experienced intermittent low back pain for 5 months, followed by left foot drop, limb weakness, and abnormal gait. MRI revealed an intramedullary hemorrhagic spinal cord lesion at T9-11, with a long syrinx and cord edema. An MRI study of the brain and the remaining spinal cord was unremarkable. The patient underwent laminectomy and near-total resection of the tumor. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of an atypical melanocytic neoplasm. Dermatological; ear, nose, and throat; and ophthalmological assessments, as well as a positron emission tomography study, were conducted to identify other neoplasms, which yielded unremarkable findings. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of IMSCMN in children because of its rarity and nonspecific imaging features.

A 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented with seizures, headaches, and photophobia. Initial suspicion of a metastatic brain tumor led to serial MRI studies, which revealed a migrating lesion in the right temporal lobe. During craniotomy, a motile helminth was surgically excised from the brain parenchyma. Histopathological analysis confirmed that the organism was an adult T. solium tapeworm, with taeniid eggs identified within the specimen, marking the first evidence of intracranial adult taeniasis and ectopic cerebral oviposition. The patient's prior oncological treatments, including mastectomy and postoperative therapies, raise hypotheses about immune or anatomical changes facilitating parasitic neuroinvasion. The discovery underscores critical gaps in diagnostics, as the lesion mimicked metastatic cancer radiologically, and therapeutics, as standard cysticidal drugs target larval stages, not adult worms. This report highlights the urgent need to investigate interactions between parasitic infections and oncological interventions. It calls for updated clinical guidelines to address this novel pathogenic mechanism and emphasizes the importance of integrating parasitological expertise into neurological care. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE25370.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Chemotherapeutic drugs like docetaxel (DTX) remain key molecules in cancer management. Silibinin (SLB) is an effective agent causing apoptosis and autophagy resulting in cancer cell death. Recently, ligand-anchored targeted nanocarrier-based drug delivery has achieved substantial improvement in cancer therapy. In the present study, chondroitin sulfate (CS) was used as a ligand to target CD44 receptors overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Herein, CS-coated chitosan-lecithin nanoparticles (CS-DTX-SLB-LCNPs) were developed for co-delivery of DTX and SLB. The CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP resulted in a particle size of 208.33 ± 2.20 nm with an entrapment efficiency of 83.81% for DTX and 92.96% for SLB. Further, the dialysis release study showed sustained release behavior, and a hemocompatible nature which was proved by the hemolysis study. The cell cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed considerably higher cell killing with CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP compared to free drugs. The cell uptake studies showed a 1.97-fold and 2.45-fold rise in fluorescence intensity from C6-LCNP and CS-C6-LCNP, respectively, as compared to free C6. CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP caused a sharp rise in the ROS level and resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which induced apoptosis and cell death. An <i>in vivo</i> efficacy study in Balb/c mice demonstrated 2.24-fold and 2-fold reduction in tumor volume after CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP treatment as compared to free DTX and free SLB groups. In conclusion, CS-DTX-SLB-LCNPs showed encouraging prospects in increasing cellular uptake and targeting specificity to treat breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Bimetallic gold nanorods decorated with platinum islands (AuNRs@Pt) are widely recognized as promising photothermal agents due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects, which enable localized heat generation for photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, photodynamic therapy (PDT) using photosensitizers (PSs) offers synergistic potential for light-activated cancer treatment. This study investigates the fluorescence behavior and plasmon energy transfer mechanisms of dumbbell-shaped AuNRs@Pt with varying Pt coverages, functionalized with thiolated β-cyclodextrin (SH-βCD) as a host for methylene blue (MB), which serves as a PS. The synthesis and functionalization of AuNRs@Pt revealed tunable plasmon damping pathways, including chemical interface damping and metal interface damping, modulated by Pt deposition and host-guest supramolecular interactions. MB attachment induces plasmon damping, with LSPR damping increasing as the Pt content increases. Functionalization with SH-βCD alters the dielectric environment, while energy dissipation facilitated by Pt islands further amplifies LSPR damping. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the preferential host-guest interaction of MB with SH-βCD rather than direct interaction with the nanoparticle surface. Meanwhile, MB inclusion increased the local dielectric constant, resulting in redshifts. Notably, host-guest inclusion reduced fluorescence quenching and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nonradiative decay, enhancing MB fluorescence and optimizing its emission properties. Additionally, Pt content modulated radiative decay rates and fluorescence quantum yield, with Pt islands amplifying electromagnetic enhancements via the Purcell effect while simultaneously reducing FRET quenching. Therefore, this work lays the foundation for developing advanced theranostic nanoplatforms that leverage the synergy between plasmonic nanoparticles and fluorescence-active molecules for targeted cancer therapies.",

However, these strategies are challenged by the non-specific and \"always on\" innate immunostimulatory effects of adjuvants, largely impeding their clinical translation. In this study, we developed a novel LNP component, sono-adjuvant lipid, to endow clinically approved LNP formulations with region-confined adjuvanticity. The engineered ultrasound (US)-activatable LNP (ULNP) precisely boosted innate immune responses in the lymph nodes (LN) through US-triggered activation of the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways in APCs. Compared to conventional LNP integrating toll-like receptor adjuvant, the combination of ULNP with localized US stimulation (ULNP + US) not only enhanced LN-specific mRNA transfection but also elicited 2.5-fold higher antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to inhibit established tumor growth. More importantly, the US-activatable adjuvanting strategy was readily applicable to potentiate tumor neoantigen-encoding circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine therapy. Combining circRNA-loaded ULNP (ci-ULNP) with US stimulation elicited potent antitumor T cell immunity and completely eliminated orthotopic liver tumors in mice. Overall, the sono-adjuvant lipid-integrated ULNP offered a robust platform for spatiotemporally tunable innate immune stimulation and mRNA vaccination therapy of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (mNSGCTs), but patients often encounter postchemotherapy residual disease. Accurate noninvasive methods are needed to predict the histology of these masses, guiding treatment and reserving surgery for those with teratoma. This study aims to enhance predictive accuracy by integrating computed tomography (CT) radiomics features with miRNAs (miR371-375) to distinguish between teratoma and nonteratoma histology in postchemotherapy residual masses. We retrospectively identified 111 lesions, divided into training and test sets (n = 78 <i>v</i> 33) with equal class distribution. 3D Slicer was used to segment lesions with a short axis of >10 mm from the postchemo-presurgical CT images, and radiomics features were extracted. Presurgery plasma miR371-375 levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Four machine learning models evaluated the predictive value of radiomics alone (R-only) and combined with miR371-375 levels, and the best performer was selected. Clinical factors associated with teratoma from univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis with the best radiomics signature to assess their impact on predicting teratoma histology. The CatBoost (CB) model R + 371 + 375 exhibited the best and most robust overall accuracy for predicting residual teratoma, with the highest AUC values (0.96, 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.0 for training, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98 for testing) and a well-balanced sensitivity and specificity. Univariate analysis identified presurgery alpha-fetoprotein (<i>P</i> = .01), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (<i>P</i> = .01), initial teratoma pathology (<i>P</i> = .01), and lymph node metastases (<i>P</i> = .02) as significant predictors for teratoma.

To address this, we developed a smartphone app that enabled individuals to perform pulmonary rehabilitation at home. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of smartphone app-guided pulmonary rehabilitation in improving exercise capacity in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. This was a multicenter prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in 2022. A total of 100 participants with chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer, were recruited, with equal distribution (50:50) between the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group followed a 12-week app-guided rehabilitation program, while the control group received standard outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was the 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD) after the 12-week rehabilitation period. Secondary outcomes included quality of life questionnaires and health care usage. Among the 100 participants included, 88 completed the follow-up visit (41 in the intervention group and 47 in the control group). Their median age was 68.0 years, and 72 (81.8%) were men. Most participants (n=70, 79.5%) had a smoking history, with a median of 40.0 pack-years. Their forced expiratory volume in 1 second was a median of 63.0% (IQR 50.5-71.5). Most participants (n=85, 96.6%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After the 12-week rehabilitation program, 6MWD was not different between the intervention and control group (median 490.0, IQR 468.8-556.3 vs 485.0, IQR 440.0-527.3 m). Assuming a clinically minimal effective change of 25 meters in 6MWD, only 7 out of 41 participants among the intervention group achieved the minimal clinically important differences after the rehabilitation program. Quality of life questionnaire scores, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, did not differ between groups. In addition, none of the participants experienced hospitalization or emergency room visits during the study period. Regarding the service satisfaction questionnaire, more than 3-quarters of the intervention group (34/41) rated their scores as ≥17/20.

This study retrospectively analyzed 102 patients with SDTT from January 2020 to May 2024. We evaluated the efficacy of different treatments for SDTT and compared the clinicopathological features and prognostic outcomes between SD-UT and SD-NSCLC. SDTT predominantly occurs in olderly male smokers. SMARCA4-dUT exhibits high NSE expression, higher risk of lymph node metastases, and lower rates of early diagnosis than SMARCA4-dNSCLC. SMARCA4-dNSCLC can be distinguished from SMARCA4-dUT by gland architecture and the diffuse expression of epithelial markers, whereas SMARCA4-dUT shows positive expression for Syn and stem cell markers. Common mutations include TP53, SMARCA4, KRAS, and STK11, with STK11/KRAS co-mutations associated with poorer prognosis. SMARCA4 protein loss was observed not only in class I mutations but also in class II mutations and wild-type cases. Both SMARCA4-dUT and SMARCA4-dNSCLC carry a high recurrence risk after radical treatment.

In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither <i>miR-155</i> nor PDL1 were detected. <i>MiR-155</i> was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection.

In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer <i>miR-155</i> expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization.

    "abstract": "Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations-resembling human club and hillock cells-are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.",

Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). <i>Brca2</i>-deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. <i>Pif1</i> helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and <i>Pif1</i> knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.",

    "title": "International neuroblastoma risk group consortium: a model of a networking for rare cancers.",
    "abstract": "It is critical to share knowledge and harmonize approaches to optimize progress in rare cancers. The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Task Force was formed by the four major neuroblastoma cooperative groups in 2004 to achieve this goal. Strategies developed for neuroblastoma are an exemplar for other rare malignancies. Data from an initial cohort of 8,800 patients were transferred to the INRG Data Commons, and a data-sharing model was developed. Currently, information on > 25,000 patients are available to the research community. The INRG staging and risk classification systems have led to harmonized approaches for therapeutic groupings. INRG consensus manuscripts have led to uniform criteria for classifying biological data, evaluating the extent of disease, and defining treatment response. More than forty INRG research studies have been performed by investigators from around the world, including analyses of rare patients which would not otherwise be possible. The success of this approach for neuroblastoma has been leveraged to create the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons and the Data for the Common Good. Efforts to enrich the INRG Commons with additional genomic and biomarker data, extracted electronic health records, and digital medical images are ongoing. The international networking model developed by the INRG Task Force has led to new research discoveries and progress in neuroblastoma. The approach has now been applied to sixteen other cancers and conditions, including rhabdomyosarcoma, germ cell tumor, Lynch Syndrome and cancer predisposition. This framework of international collaboration and data sharing serves as a model for advancing rare adult malignancies.",

    "abstract": "The clinical translation of exosome-based diagnostics and therapies is hindered by significant molecular heterogeneity. Current exosome phenotyping methods suffer from insufficient sensitivity, limited multiplexing capability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, we developed a digital wafer-level micropillar array (WLM-Exo) platform. The chip features a high-surface-area micropillar array functionalized with a DSPE-PEG2000 lipid layer via Au-S bonding, enabling lipid-mediated membrane fusion for universal exosome enrichment and a uniform spatial distribution. Following capture, aptamer-based SERS nanotags bind specifically to target proteins on exosomes, generating distinct Raman signals upon laser excitation. Exosomal proteins are digitally quantified by measuring the activated area in the Raman images, exhibiting a log-log linear correlation with exosome concentration. The WLM-Exo platform demonstrates ultrasensitive detection (LOD: 2.11 particles/μL for CD63, 1.17 particles/μL for EpCAM, and 18.3 particles/μL for dual-biomarkers) and simultaneous tetra-color exosomal phenotyping capability. By enabling precise, scalable, and digital protein profiling, this technology offers significant potential for exosomes subtyping in personalized cancer diagnostics and therapeutics monitoring.",

    "title": "Biochemical mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock.",
    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by core clock proteins, coordinate physiological functions with daily environmental fluctuations across organisms, from bacteria to humans. The circadian clock interacts with various biological processes, and its disruption is associated with numerous human diseases, including sleep disorders, metabolic syndrome, and potentially cancer. In mammals, the circadian clock is driven by cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs), in which CLOCK and BMAL1 act as transcriptional activators, while PER and CRY serve as transcriptional repressors. During the early repression phase, the CRY-PER-CK1 complex binds to CLOCK-BMAL1, displacing it from target promoters. In the late repression phase, in the absence of PER, CRY1 alone inhibits CLOCK-BMAL1 activity by blocking the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Biochemical and structural studies have highlighted the essential roles of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and posttranslational modifications in regulating the molecular clock. In this Review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms that govern the circadian clock and focus on the coordination of protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications, underscoring the importance of the circadian clock in disease progression and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive transcriptomic alterations observed in tumors, the global landscape of isoform-level alternative splicing in cancer remains largely unexplored. Leveraging long-read sequencing, we successfully identified and characterized full-length isoforms, along with tumor-specific splicing events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our analysis identified 38,058 previously unannotated isoforms, which were subsequently validated using orthogonal multi-omics datasets to confirm their transcriptional and translational activities. Notably, 269 splicing events were characterized as tumor-specific, with 17 showing significant associations with NSCLC subtypes, while 13 were enriched across all NSCLC cases. Among these events, skipped exons in <i>IFI27</i>, <i>PUF60</i> and <i>ANAPC11</i>, as well as an alternative first exon in <i>YBEY</i>, were absent from GENCODE annotations. These findings underscore the intricate complexity of isoforms and their clinical significance, particularly in terms of NSCLC subtype specificity and their potential as therapeutic targets. In conclusion, this study provides a valuable resource for the discovery of tumor-specific splicing targets in NSCLC, leveraging the unique advantages of long-read sequencing.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the tumor-host interaction is modeled using a Lotka-Volterra framework. The critical parameters that define the possible dynamical regimes are identified through linear stability analysis. The effects of both constant and periodic perturbations are examined, along with their clinical implications. The treatment dose required to drive the system to a desired state is determined. It is also shown that aggressive tumors evolve toward a limit cycle when the host is under the action of low-frequency periodic treatment. As the frequency increases, a transition to a non-chaotic attractor occurs. This transition narrows as the frequency of the external periodic perturbation increases. No chaotic behavior is observed, even at higher values of both perturbation strength and frequency, as the maximum Lyapunov exponent remains negative. These results suggest that although aggressive tumors may not be completely eradicated by conventional anticancer therapies, they could potentially be controlled through external low-frequency periodic treatments that target directly only the host, such as immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Genetic fusion of protein tags is widely used to study protein functions in vivo. It is well known that tag fusion can cause unwanted changes in protein stability, but whether this is an inherent property of the tagged protein, or can be influenced by the cell and tissue environment, is unclear. Using a series of genome edited mouse models, we show that tag-dependent changes in protein expression can vary across different primary cell and tissue contexts. In one case (Ncaph2), a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron fusion strongly increased protein stability in some tissues but decreased it in others. Destabilisation resulted from tissue-specific 'leakage' of the auxin-inducible degron, which depended on TIR1 expression, and occurred selectively in the small intestine where basal concentrations of auxin/ indole-3-acetic acid can reach levels that are sufficient to trigger protein degradation in cultured cells. Stabilisation occurred in post-mitotic cells via an endogenous degradation signal situated at the NCAPH2 C-terminus, which normally undergoes activation upon cell cycle exit, but is inactivated by C-terminal tag fusion. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of cell and tissue environment in determining the consequences of tag fusions on protein expression, which may be particularly important in animal models that contain diverse cell types.",

For patients with cancer, smoking cessation can extend survival, while persistent smoking causes numerous problems (eg, cancer recurrence). This intensive longitudinal study with cancer patients aimed to evaluate the link between TMH constructs and smoking outcomes. Participants included 42 newly diagnosed head/neck cancer patients who reported smoking in the past month. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire before a 30-day daily assessment. Single-item measures were used for all constructs. Participants who perceived more benefits of quitting smoking smoked fewer cigarettes, P < .05. Also, participants who reported less cancer worry smoked fewer cigarettes, P = .03. Within-persons, less cancer worry than one's personal average predicted decreases in cigarettes the next day, P = .01. Perceiving greater benefits of quitting, and social support than one's average predicted lower motivation but higher confidence to quit the same day, Ps < .05. Greater cancer worry than one's average predicted day-to-day increases in cigarettes smoked, P < .01. Perceiving greater benefits of quitting and greater social support than one's average predicted smoking fewer cigarettes that day, Ps < .05. Components of the TMH are associated with favorable smoking cessation outcomes after a cancer diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Patients with cancer are at increased risk of thrombotic complications from both the disease and its treatments, with antithrombotic therapy (ATT) usually continued in the last phase of life where the benefit is less clear and there is high risk of harms. Physiological changes toward the end of life increase the risk that ATT will cause serious bleeding events, but discussion between clinicians and patients of ATT risks and benefits is sub-optimal. This realist synthesis explores shared decision-making (SDM) to: (a) provide insights into why prescribing continues in end-of-life care; (b) build a conceptual platform for optimizing ATT prescribing for persons living with cancer towards end-of-life. We conducted a realist synthesis using context-mechanism-outcome configurations and 'if…then' statements. A total of 17,036 citations identified across 10 databases (Medline, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Complete, CDSR, CENTRAL, EPISTEMONIKOS, Web of Science Core Collection, Assia, Google Scholar). Ninety-one papers included following reverse chronology quota record screening (from: database searches (n = 56), consortium experts (n = 35)). Included papers: quantitative (n = 40), qualitative (n = 17), mixed-methods (n = 2), evidence syntheses (n = 16), commentaries (n = 9), case reports (n = 7). Exclusion criteria: persons <18 years, non-English language, not focused on SDM or deprescribing in palliative care. An analytic appraisal journal was used with realist logic to synthesize insights from included papers (contents from 43/91 included in this paper). The concept of 'prescribing inertia' was used to formulate explanatory theories about clinician reluctance to deprescribe and the mechanisms underpinning SDM, including (a) the meaning medications have to end-of-life patients (e.g., 'life preserving' or 'symptom management') and public awareness of medications (e.g., high-profile chemotherapy versus low-profile ATT) are determinants of: (i) clinician motivation to engage patients around deprescribing, (ii) patient understanding, volition and participation in SDM; (b) SDM for ATT deprescribing requires sensitive engagement with patients and families without removing positivity around survival and continuing clinician interest in their welfare; (c) multi-disciplinary clinical decision-making about timing and suitability of deprescribing in end-of-life care requires specialized consensus-driven processes and evidence-based decision support tools; (d) if patients are healthy enough, empowerment interventions outside clinical encounters (e.g., health literacy apps) may increase patient and family readiness to engage in deprescribing conversations; (e) organizational investments can facilitate discussion of deprescribing (e.g., improved electronic medical record prompts, clinician communication skills training, data presentation to clinicians of actual ATT risks). Limitations: despite robust screening and selection, the sample of included papers does not reflect the entirety of eligible source material and did not include a systematic search for papers focusing on low- and middle-income country countries. Implementation of ATT deprescribing is enabled or constrained by (a) the meaning of medications to patients; (b) clinician engagement and understanding; (c) multi-disciplinary clinical decision-making processes (including support tools); (d) patient empowerment; (e) organizational investment. Addressing these multi-level factors, including the development of SDM tools, can address the prescribing inertia that may cause devastating impacts on patients and their families as well as moral distress amongst healthcare staff.

We performed an integrated pan-cancer analysis of HuR using public datasets. This encompassed expression profiling, survival analysis, diagnostic accuracy assessment, immune microenvironment characterization, and drug sensitivity prediction. We investigated HuR's regulatory mechanisms through pathway correlation and differential gene expression analyses. HuR expression was consistently elevated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor patient prognosis. It demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (>85%) via TMB/PD-L1 biomarkers. High HuR expression was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and reduced efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, establishing it as a key immunoregulatory biomarker. HuR also predicted sensitivity to cell cycle inhibitors and other pathway-targeted drugs. Mechanistically, HuR drives malignancy by dysregulating core processes: cell cycle progression, immune evasion, and cellular metabolism. Our pan-cancer analysis establishes HuR as a consistently upregulated oncogenic driver across malignancies, functioning as a potential universal biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis. Its critical roles in modulating the immune response and predicting therapeutic sensitivity highlight its importance for personalized cancer treatment strategies. HuR orchestrates tumorigenesis and malignant progression by integrally regulating vital cellular processes.",

COVID-19 infection may lead to increased cancer risk, as seen with other viruses, or to decreased risk due to the activation of the immune response during acute infection. This study aimed to determine the association between cancer incidence in US Veterans and COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US Veterans comparing those who tested positive for COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19 between March 15, 2020, and Nov 30, 2020, to those who tested negative. We used data from the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource and Cox proportional hazard regression models to determine the hazard ratio of a new cancer diagnosis within a three-year follow-up period for the COVID-19 positive patients compared to those who were negative. Covariates included age, race, ethnicity, sex, BMI, smoking, being an active patient in the VHA system within a year of the COVID-19 test, and other factors. 499,396 patients were included in this study, with 88590 (17.2%) COVID-19 positive, 427566 (82.8%) COVID-19 negative. The ages of the COVID-19 positive and negative patients were 57.9 ± 16.4 and 59.5 ± 15.8, respectively. For those who survived for at least 30 days after COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 infection was associated with a 25% reduction in the hazard of cancer (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.73-0.77). The reduction of the hazard was similar across sexes and races, except in Asians. Above 45 years of age, the hazard of cancer incidence further decreased with advancing age. Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic had a decreased risk of cancer incidence in a 3-year follow-up across gender and race.

    "abstract": "Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive muscle disorder characterized by inflammation and degeneration with altered proteostasis. To better understand the interrelationship between these two features, we aimed at establishing a novel preclinical mouse model. First, we used quantitative PCR to determine expression of pro-inflammatory chemo- and cytokines including lymphotoxin (LT)-signaling pathway components in human skeletal muscle tissue diagnosed with myositis. Based on these results we generated a mouse model that we analyzed at the histological, ultrastructural, transcriptional, biochemical, and behavioral level. Lastly, we subjected this model to anti-inflammatory treatments. After confirming and extending previous data on activation of lymphotoxin (LT)-signaling in human myositis, we generated distinct transgenic mouse lines co-expressing LTα and -β in skeletal muscle fibers. Transgenic mice displayed chronic myositis accompanied by dysregulated proteostasis, including an altered autophagolysosomal pathway that initially shows signs of activation and later exhaustion and decreased flux. To enhance the latter, we genetically impaired autophagy in skeletal muscle cells. Autophagy impairment alone induced a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state, but no obvious cellular inflammation. However, the combination of LT-driven myositis with autophagy impairment induced the full spectrum of characteristic molecular and pathological features of IBM in skeletal muscle, including protein inclusions with typical ultrastructural morphology and mild mitochondrial pathology. Our attempts to treat the pathology by subjecting these mice to corticosteroids or anti-Thy1.2 antibodies mirrored recent treatment failures in humans, i.e., none of these treatments resulted in significant clinical improvement of motor performance or the transcriptional profile of muscle pathology. In summary, these data provide evidence that inflammation and autophagy disruption play a synergistic role in the development of IBM-like muscular pathology. Furthermore, once established, IBM-like pathology in these mice, as in human IBM patients cannot be reverted or prevented from progression by conventional means of immunosuppression. We expect that this novel mouse model will help to identify future treatment modalities for IBM.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells are of vital importance in human autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to differentiation and functional plasticity, Th17 cells are able to produce a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17A, interferon (IFN)-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and modulation of Th17 cell activities represents a desirable tool for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we aimed at understanding the role of the surface molecule CD5 and its intracellular interaction partner casein kinase 2 (CK2) in human Th17 effector function as well as their role in MS. We performed targeted single-cell RNA sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from people with MS (pwMS) and non-inflammatory neurological diseases, and high-sensitivity proteomic analysis of serum and CSF from 114 pwMS by using a proximity extension assay (PEA) together with functional investigations on CD4+ memory T cells differentiated into a Th17-polarised phenotype. Blockade of CD5 reduced production of IL-17A, IFN-γ and GM-CSF by Th17-polarised cells without affecting proliferation. In comparison, blockade of its intracellular interaction partner CK2 exerted partly similar effects with a decrease in IL-17A and GM-CSF production but also impaired T cell proliferation. Both blocking agents resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of the downstream signalling molecule STAT3. The CD5 targeting treatment was able to abolish cytotoxic effects caused by Th17-polarised cells. Importantly, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis showed that CD5 expression correlates with an inflammatory immune profile in MS in serum as well as CSF. Our study highlights the importance of the CD5-CK2-STAT3 signalling axis for inflammatory responses of human Th17-polarised cells. Since in humans CD5 expression correlates with inflammation and cellular injury, targeting the CD5 signalling pathway provides future therapeutic opportunities for - among other diseases - MS.",

Its major subtypes-lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), lung adenocarcinoma, and small-cell LC-exhibit distinct risk factors and genetic susceptibilities, necessitating the use of subtype-specific biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted using protein quantitative trait loci from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and deCODE datasets. A robust analytical framework, including reverse MR, meta-analysis, summary-data-based MR tests, and colocalization, cisMR-cML, MR.CUE and phenotype scanning analyses were used to identify proteins associated with LC risk. We conducted a systematic review to contextualize our research findings. Follow-up analyses, including pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction network analysis, and druggability evaluations, were used to explore the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the identified proteins. Significant proteins were validated using population-level proteomic data from the UK Biobank (UKB). The results showed that twenty-five proteins were significantly associated with LC or its subtypes, including 15 novel findings. 60S ribosomal protein L14 (RPL14) and advanced glycosylation end-product-specific receptor (AGER) emerged as the strongest discovery, demonstrating consistent and significant associations across both MR and population-level analyses.

    "title": "Developing and validating modular surveys for vector-borne diseases: A study protocol.",
    "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases are an increasing threat to human health and well-being in the United States. Understanding public perception and practices to reduce vector abundance and vector-human contact can guide effective interventions. Nevertheless, vector-borne disease surveys, which are widely used in the field to understand public perception and practices, are often inconsistent in terms of structure and implementation. This protocol is designed to provide guidance for public health professionals and researchers in the development of future knowledge, attitudes, and practices studies by ensuring uniformity in design and structure. This manuscript describes a rigorous three-phase protocol for the development of standardized vector-borne disease survey modules that can be used throughout the United States to generate data that are comparable across diverse regions. During phase one, a workshop with subject matter experts and a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify survey domains and generate items of interest. Survey items will also be mapped based on two theoretical frameworks: the Health Belief Model and the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-Regulation framework. Standards across knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys will enhance the analysis and interpretation of the data across geographies and time. During phase two, a group of expert judges will evaluate survey items based on content relevance, representativeness, and technical quality. During the final phase, cognitive interviews and surveys with target audience groups will be conducted to measure and ensure the face validity, reliability, and external validity of the modules. Participants will be drawn from a diverse range of educational backgrounds and geographic locations. The surveys developed through this protocol will facilitate acquisition of insights into the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning vector-borne diseases, allowing for the collection of comparable data across various regions in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Delays in cancer treatment can result in tumor growth, increased clonal heterogeneity, upstaging, increased symptoms, organ damage, increased psychological distress, and worse clinical outcomes. Evidence supported guidelines for treatment timeliness exist in many cancers, but not for multiple myeloma (MM) though there is reason to believe delays in treatment would be detrimental. This scoping review aims to explore what is known about the impacts of the time from diagnosis to treatment among patients with MM. Our review will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. Our search strategy was developed to identify sources published in or after the year 2000 related to time to treatment for adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Embase. Sources will be screened by two independent reviewers after exclusion/inclusion criteria are pilot tested and refined. A data extraction form was developed and will be refined by the study team for use during the scoping review. This review will summarize the landscape of research related to time to treatment among newly diagnosed adults with multiple myeloma. Raising awareness of the available evidence on this topic, within the MM clinical and research community, will guide future research to address identified knowledge gaps. This protocol was registered with Open Science Framework (OSF) on the 25th of March, 2025 and can be found at osf.io/sydqw.",

    "abstract": "Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of EGFR-sensitive-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the metabolic mechanisms driving third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. We conducted plasma metabolomics analysis on 216 longitudinal samples from 186 NSCLC patients enrolled in the clinical trial of rezivertinib (NCT03386955). Additionally, multi-omics profiling of rezivertinib-resistant cell lines, functional in vitro experiments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of 215 NSCLC patients were integrated to reveal underlying mechanisms. Non-responder patients exhibited elevated glycerophospholipids and dysregulated lysophospholipid (LPL) metabolism. Unsupervised clustering identified two patient subgroups, with Cluster 1 (characterized by high LPL levels) associated with poorer survival (P = 0.022). Metabolite-based predictive model achieved robust performance (AUC: 0.7762 [training], 0.7485 [test]). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated LPLs and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) accumulation during the resistance process. Integrated multi-omics analyses highlighted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glycerophospholipid reprogramming in rezivertinib-resistant cells. Functional assays confirmed that LPA promoted cell migration and invasion, and attenuated the efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKI, while disruption of the LPA-LPAR signaling axis reversed LPA-mediated resistance. scRNA-seq identified an LPA-secreting malignant subset (cluster c4), characterized by enhanced EMT activation and extensive microenvironmental crosstalk through Wnt, TGF-β, and ECM signals. Our study highlights the pivotal role of LPA-mediated signaling and metabolic reprogramming in third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. Targeting LPA production or its downstream pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance. This study provides critical metabolic insights for managing EGFR-sensitive-mutant NSCLC.",

However, outcomes are poor for multiply relapsed/refractory tumors. We studied gemcitabine/docetaxel/melphalan/carboplatin (GemDMC), which exploits DNA damage repair inhibition. We hypothesized that concurrent bevacizumab, targeting the high vascularity of GCT, would synergize with HDC. Trial eligibility included 2nd or later relapse or poor-risk 1st relapse, and adequate end-organ function. Treatment consisted of sequential bevacizumab-GemDMC (HDC cycle 1, C1) and bevacizumab-ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) (C2), in 3 consecutive cohorts: bevacizumab/full-dose GemDMC (cohort 1), bevacizumab/reduced-dose GemDMC (cohort 2), and no bevacizumab/reduced-dose GemDMC (cohort 3). The trial was powered to distinguish a target 50% 2-year RFS rate from an expected <25%. We validated its results in an off-trial 4th cohort treated the same as cohort 3. We treated 165 male patients (65 trial, 100 cohort 4), after a median of 3 prior therapy lines; mostly cisplatin-refractory tumors at relapse (45% refractory, 23% absolutely refractory); 19% primary mediastinal tumors. Overall response rate: 84.5% (77% CR/PRm-). The treatment-related mortality rates in cohorts 1 to 4 were 13%, 8%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. Resection of residual lesions in 74 patients found no viable GCT in 76%. The 5-year RFS and overall survival rates were 57.1% and 58.3%, respectively, without differences between trial and cohort 4 patients, or between patients receiving bevacizumab (cohorts 1/2) or not (cohorts 3/4). Sequential GemDMC-(I)CE in multiply poor-risk relapsed GCT shows outcomes that exceed the anticipated results. Bevacizumab did not improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With surgery being the only potential cure for pancreatic cancer, high-risk premalignant pancreatic lesions often go unnoticed by palpation or white light visualization, leading to recurrence. We asked whether near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tumor-associated inflammation could identify high-risk premalignant lesions, leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a sentinel of local disease and, thus, enhance surgery outcomes. Fluorescence-guided surgery was performed on genetically engineered mice (Ptf1a-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+; Smad4flox/flox [KSC]) at discrete stages of disease progression, histologically confirmed high-risk, premalignant lesions in postnatal mice to locally advanced pancreatic tumors in adults, using the imaging agent V-1520, a translocator protein (TSPO) ligand. Age-matched wild-type littermates were used as controls, while Ptf1a-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+(KC) mice modeled pancreatitis and precursors of low penetrance. Localization of V-1520 and tumor-associated macrophages amongst the TME was detected by immunofluorescence imaging. V-1520 exhibited robust accumulation in the pancreata of KSC mice from the early postnatal stage. Increased accumulation was observed in the pancreata of adolescent- and adult-aged mice with greater ductal lesion and stromal burden. Confocal microscopy of ex vivo pancreas specimens co-localized V-1520 accumulation primarily with CD68-expressing macrophage in KSC mice. Unlike the pancreata of KSC mice, accumulation of V-1520 did not exceed background levels in the pancreata of KC mice with pancreatitis. V-1520 exhibited differential accumulation in pancreatic cancer-associated inflammation compared to pancreatitis. Given the robust tracer uptake in tissues associated with early yet high-risk lesions, we envision V-1520 could enhance surgical resection and reduce the potential for recurrence from residual disease.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family, shares high homology with both UCP1 and UCP2. Its exact functional role has been elusive since its discovery, with previous studies primarily focusing on studying UCP3 function in differentiated skeletal muscle myotubes or whole animal models because basal levels of UCP3 protein are low in undifferentiated myoblasts. In the present study, we demonstrate that UCP3 plays a role in modulating energy and redox stress related pathways in undifferentiated muscle myoblasts. Although low, UCP3 mRNA and protein levels were detectable in WT myoblasts. Both whole-body UCP3 knockout (wKO) and conditional UCP3 knockout (cKO) myoblasts displayed increased activation of AMPK (pAMPK) and elevated levels of PPARδ/β and GLUT4 proteins compared to wild type (WT) myoblasts. This altered energy signaling was further associated with UCP3 KO myoblasts exhibiting impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, while WT cells and UCP3 KO cells expressing WT UCP3 were sensitive to insulin stimulation. Moroever, UCP3 KO myoblasts had an accumulation of fatty acids and upregulation of downstream PPARδ target genes in UCP3 KO cells. Lastly, UCP3 KO myoblasts were found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress and hypoxia, due in part to a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio compared to WT myoblasts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that UCP3 is a key modulator of energy sensing and oxidative stress in undifferentiated skeletal muscle myoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in advanced melanoma can result in durable responses, yet an algorithm to decide which patients can safely discontinue ICI is still lacking. We used a multimodal approach combining clinical data, AI-based analysis of H&E-stained whole-slide images of melanoma before ICI start, and gene expression signatures to identify biomarkers for relapse after discontinuing ICI in the absence of treatment progression. Univariable Cox regression analysis identified best overall response, mRNA expression of six genes, tumor cell density (TCD), and the lymphocyte to plasma cell ratio (LYM/PC) as factors predictive of relapse upon cessation of ICI. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that both TGFBR1 expression and the integral digital pathology parameter-based prognostic system were independently associated with relapse after ICI discontinuation. Training a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) model achieved the highest overall predictive accuracy of 84.6% for relapse after ICI discontinuation. The identified prognostic markers are fully explainable and easily implementable in routine practice and facilitate risk stratification upon cessation of ICI therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Primary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PHNENs), including primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PHNEC), are extremely rare. PHNENs typically exhibit slow growth, although mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms have poor prognoses. PHNENs are also challenging to diagnose. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old man underwent plain computed tomography (CT), which incidentally detected a 42-mm solitary hepatic tumor. Serum levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were elevated at 138 mAU/mL. Thirteen days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enlarged hepatic tumor with tumor thromboses extending into the hepatic and portal veins. No early-phase enhancement was observed. At 18 days, Doppler ultrasound and dynamic CT evaluated the tumor as hypovascular, and a newly swollen solitary lymph node appeared. At 39 days, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT revealed strong uptake in the primary liver tumor and metastatic lymph nodes, with additional distant lymph node metastases emerging. At 49 days, a metastatic cervical lymph node was surgically resected. At 61 days, PHNEC was definitively diagnosed based on histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments. The Ki-67 labeling index was >90%. At 67 days, he was hospitalized to begin chemotherapy, but CT revealed end-stage disease. Palliative treatment was required, and the patient died of cancer 82 days after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a thought-provoking case of PHNEC with rapid oncological progression. To clarify clinical implications (eg, atypical imaging features and diagnostic pitfalls), detailed imaging findings are provided. We anticipate that this case will be informative for clinicians in this field.",

In this aspect, organoids offer a more faithful environment than their classical two-dimensional counterparts in vitro. Similarly, syngeneic murine models also allow researchers to investigate more complete tumor-host interactions, such as with the immune system, in vivo. Here we present a complete protocol on extracting fallopian tube epithelial cells, the cell-of-origin of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), from a mouse and derive them as primary organoid cultures, as well as their in vitro culture and maintenance. Then, we describe how to use genetic engineering techniques, such as lentiviral or retroviral gene overexpression, as well as CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion, to modify these lines and transform them into pre-cancerous tumoroids. We also report how to use them for in vitro validation, via the extraction of genetic materials and immunofluorescence staining. Finally, we indicate how to effectively inject these tumoroids in the ovarian bursa, the autochthonous site of HGSOC, for tumor initiation.",

    "abstract": "Lenalidomide maintenance is the most frequently utilized approach for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients following induction therapy with/without consolidative high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. Baseline and longitudinal measurable residual disease (MRD) negative status is a well-established positive predictive sign in lenalidomide maintenance patients. However, the clinical utility of serial MRD assessments remains uncertain, as there is no consensus on the clinical management of MRD-resurgence (MRDres) or stable remissions in patients positive for MRD. Here we report the complete and final results of a phase 2, single-arm study of 5 years of continuous lenalidomide maintenance in MM patients following unrestricted upfront therapy, along with exploratory peripheral blood T cell profiling experiments performed via high-dimensional spectral cytometry. Patients with MRDres had inferior PFS to those with sustained MRD-negativity at the 1- and 2-year landmarks (P=0.036, P=0.0014 respectively); however, myeloma progression only occurred within 2 years of MRDres in 36% of patients, with no progression observed in the remaining 64% of patients at last follow-up. Exploratory peripheral blood T cell profiling experiments throughout the trial period identified an immune signature of early relapse in patient cohorts both negative and positive for MRD at the start of maintenance therapy. T cell profiles enriched with activated cytotoxic effectors predicted early relapse while quiescent T cell profiles enriched with naïve T cell populations predicted durable remissions. This \"immune-MRD\" status showed predictive potential, and segregated patients with MRDres and early disease progression from patients with sustained remission despite MRDres.",

This analysis evaluates the prognostic role of baseline CTC enumeration and its interaction with treatment regimens in patients progressing on CDK4/6 inhibitors. The PACE trial is a phase II, multicenter, randomized study of HR+/HER2- MBC patients experiencing progression on aromatase inhibitors (AI) and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Patients were randomized 1:2:1 to receive fulvestrant (F), F+palbociclib (F+P), or F+P+avelumab (F+P+A). Baseline CTCs were enumerated using CellSearch™ with a threshold of ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL to classify patients as StageIV indolent or StageIV aggressive. Concurrent ctDNA analysis was performed using Guardant360®. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Among 220 randomized patients, 203 were evaluable for baseline CTCs; 76% had detectable CTCs, and 49% were StageIV aggressive. Patients with de novo MBC were more frequently StageIV aggressive (47.5% vs. 30.8%). Baseline CTCs were prognostic, with median PFS of 5.7 months for StageIV indolent and 3.5 months for StageIV aggressive patients (HR 1.69, 90% CI 1.27-2.24, P<0.001). In StageIV aggressive patients, F+P and F+P+A improved PFS versus F alone (HR 0.43, 90% CI 0.25-0.71 and HR 0.26, 90% CI 0.14-0.49, respectively). No benefit was observed in StageIV indolent patients (interaction p=0.0148 and p=0.0033, respectively). Baseline CTC enumeration provides significant prognostic information in HR+/HER2- MBC. StageIV aggressive patients derive greater benefit from F+P or F+P+A over F alone, independent of clinical or ctDNA features. This highlights the potential of to guide treatment decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing is a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. With Food and Drug Administration approval for poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in patients with metastatic breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, there is an additional therapeutic rationale for testing all patients with these cancers for germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. However, many at-risk patients do not have access to genetic services, leaving many genetic carriers unidentified. The eREACH (A Randomized Study of an eHealth Delivery Alternative for Cancer Genetic Testing for Hereditary Predisposition in Metastatic Breast, Ovarian, Prostate, and Pancreatic Cancer Patients) study evaluates the effectiveness of a theoretically and stakeholder-informed eHealth (eg, digital) delivery alternative to traditional genetic counseling for patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer or advanced or metastatic ovarian or pancreatic cancer referred for genetic testing to determine whether they are candidates for a PARP inhibitor. The eREACH study is a randomized noninferiority study using a 2 × 2 design to test a self-directed digital intervention to deliver clinical genetic testing for patients with metastatic cancers. The traditional standard-of-care pretest (visit 1) and posttest (visit 2-disclosure) counseling delivered by a genetic counselor is replaced with our patient-informed digital intervention. The four arms were as follows: arm A, genetic counselor for visits 1 and 2; arm B, genetic counselor for visit 1 and digital intervention for visit 2; arm C, digital intervention for visit 1 and genetic counselor for visit 2; and arm D, digital intervention for both visits. Participants were adults with advanced or metastatic breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The primary outcomes of this study were change in genetic knowledge and anxiety from baseline to postdisclosure assessment. We will test whether the digital intervention is noninferior to standard-of-care counseling with a genetic counselor using a modified noninferiority ANOVA of the posttest disclosure minus baseline change scores. In secondary analyses, we will test pairwise differences among the 4 groups. As of January 2025, we have completed enrollment of 229 participants. Data analysis is ongoing, and we expect the results to be published in 2025. Increasing indications for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing create a pressing need to evaluate alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of these tests while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. The eREACH study evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive, patient-centered digital intervention to deliver clinical genetic testing to patients with metastatic cancers. We expect that this work will inform evidence-based guidelines and the standard of care for delivery of genetic testing, and it is designed to be broadly applicable and easily adaptable for other populations and settings even beyond oncology.

    "abstract": "Rectal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality, requiring accurate diagnosis via MRI scans. However, detecting rectal cancer in MRI scans is challenging due to image complexity and the need for precise localization. While transformer-based object detection has excelled in natural images, applying these models to medical data is hindered by limited medical imaging resources. To address this, we propose the Spatially Prioritized Detection Transformer (SP DETR), which incorporates a Spatially Prioritized (SP) Decoder to constrain anchor boxes to regions of interest (ROI) based on anatomical maps, focusing the model on areas most likely to contain cancer. Additionally, the SP cross-attention mechanism refines the learning of anchor box offsets. To improve small cancer detection, we introduce the Global Context-Guided Feature Fusion Module (GCGFF), leveraging a transformer encoder for global context and a Globally-Guided Semantic Fusion Block (GGSF) to enhance high-level semantic features. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves detection accuracy, especially for small rectal cancers, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating anatomical priors with transformer-based models for clinical applications.",

Samples were classified according to the MSRSGC (nondiagnostic [ND], nonneoplastic [NN], atypia of undetermined significance [AUS], benign neoplasm [BN], salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential [SUMP], suspicious for malignancy [SM], and malignant [M]) and the WHO system (insufficient/inadequate/nondiagnostic, benign, atypical, neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential [NUMP], suspicious for malignancy [SM], and malignant [M]). The risk of malignancy (ROM) was calculated for each category, and diagnostic performance metrics were assessed. In the MSRSGC, the ROM was ND, 50% (n = 2); NN, 16.8% (n = 149); AUS (no cases); BN, 4.3% (n = 514); SUMP, 50% (n = 2); SM, 56.1% (n = 66); and M, 98.2% (n = 623).

Based on the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice, an evidence-based practice process was established in a large, downtown hospital's oncology infusion center designed to assess the distress and burden level of the family caregivers. Using the Caregiver Quality of Life Index - Cancer questionnaire, family caregivers were assessed for their overall sense of well-being. In the initial pilot process, family caregivers of patients with GI or lung cancer were asked if they wished to participate as they represented two of the largest disease group populations for this oncology clinic. Eighty-three family caregivers (44%) agreed. The sixty-six family caregivers who reported an increased level of distress were referred to the oncology medical social worker to assist with interventions as indicated by their responses. The efficacy of this proactive approach of assessing family caregiver distress resulted in the implementation of 95 baseline interventions for the 66 participants. The follow-up assessments resulted in 25 interventions, a 26% decrease. Family caregivers reported a 13% increase in their reported quality of life at the time of their third evaluation with the lowest scores improving by 50%. The need for ongoing support services for oncology family caregivers to help them thrive through the cancer journey was validated. In response to this need, as of September 2024, this process became a permanent feature of the hospital's oncology infusion center services which now supports family caregivers of patients in all oncology disease groups.",

    "title": "Medicinal Chemistry Perspective of 1,8-Naphthyridines as Anticancer Agents.",
    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, mainly due to chemo resistance and the limited chemotherapy options. 1,8-Naphthyridine (NP) is a promising scaffold in medicinal chemistry, recognized for its wide range of biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anti-mycobacterial, and antiplatelet effects. In addition, these synthetic derivatives have been shown to exhibit a wide range of activities, including anti-osteoporotic (α(v)β(3) antagonists), antioxidant, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition, protein kinase inhibition, ionotropic effects, β-3 antagonism, anti-allergic, antimalarial, gastric anti-secretory, bronchodilator, anticonvulsant, anti-hypertensive, platelet aggregation inhibition, MDR modulation, adenosine receptor agonist, adrenoceptor antagonist, and pesticide activities. In this review, we attempt to compile and discuss various approaches (Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, Conrad-Limpach reaction, double hetero-annulation process of Michael abducts, the Friedlander synthetic approach) for the synthesis of NPs and the anticancer effect of these derivatives on different targets, including receptor tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptors), casein kinase 2, c-Met kinase, DNA topoisomerase, cannabinoid, and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) receptors with their associated signaling pathways, mechanisms of action, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR). This review offers an in-depth medicinal and pharmacological profile of NPs as anticancer agents, intending to guide researchers in developing novel, selective, effective, and safe anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "With an anticipated increase in breast screening volume, provincial healthcare systems and health leaders must identify innovative technologies and care pathways that can alleviate the burden of an already resource-constrained healthcare system. The solution explored here utilizes vacuum-assisted technology that is clinically equivalent and a more cost-effective alternative care pathway, as successfully demonstrated in many other countries. This article reviews the clinical efficacy of Vacuum-Assisted Biopsy (VAB) and Vacuum-Assisted Excision (VAE) and calculates the potential Canadian direct cost savings by implementing VAE for the management of benign and high-risk breast lesions in place of Surgical Diagnostic Excision (SDE): calculated to be $1,607,769 to $11,341,107 (2025 CAD) annually in Canada, or $2,208 (2025 CAD) per-patient procedural savings from avoiding SDEs. Additional non-quantifiable patient benefits are also explored: avoiding unnecessary surgery; preventing the associated anxiety and time off work; and greater patient autonomy over their diagnosis journey, helping maintain their quality of life. Finally, barriers to adoption are identified, and an Implementation Leadership Action Plan is proposed, to help support the successful integration of this practice shift. The plan includes procedural reimbursement and policy changes, and multidisciplinary engagement targeting radiology, surgery, and pathology stakeholders.",

    "title": "Noncancer-Related Mortality in Randomized Clinical Trials: A Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Cancer screening is a critical tool in cancer control, reducing cancer-specific mortality. However, it also has potential harms, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Measuring the effect of screening based on all-cause mortality is insensitive to both benefits and harms and requires substantially large sample sizes. Understanding the impact of screening on noncancer-related (off-target) mortality is essential for evaluating its overall benefit. To assess the association between cancer screening and off-target mortality by comparing mortality rates between screened and unscreened populations based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The analysis examined all RCTs included in a previously published (August 28, 2023) meta-analysis of cancer screening trials that included the end point of all-cause mortality in addition to targeted cancer mortality. All RCTs included in the previous meta-analysis were included. The latest search in that meta analysis was conducted on October 12, 2022, with no language or publication date restrictions. The study followed relevant portions of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Two authors independently extracted data, and a third author verified those data. Off-target mortality was analyzed using rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs via a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary outcome was off-target mortality, defined as deaths with a cause that was not the targeted cancer. A total of 17 RCTs (8 of colorectal, 3 prostate, 3 lung, 2 breast, and 1 multiple cancers) including 1 305 924 participants with 18 508 192 person-years of follow-up were included. Screening did not significantly increase off-target mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01); the overall increase in off-target mortality was 0.2% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.9%). There was no evidence of heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 0.00%; Cochran Q = 14.96, df = 18; P = .66). The trial-specific RRs ranged from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.69-1.15) to 1.09 (95% CI, 0.98-1.22), with all 95% CIs including 1. Targeted cancer deaths accounted for 2.6% to 33.1% of all deaths, depending on the cancer type. These findings show that randomization to cancer screening was not associated with more than a very small increase in noncancer-related mortality, with the 95% CI excluding an increase of greater than 1%. The findings emphasize the importance of evaluating targeted and off-target mortality separately rather than relying solely on all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of breast and gynecologic cancers may hamper employment; little is known about who is at greater risk of resignation. To examine whether a breast or gynecologic cancer diagnosis is associated with resignation in working women and to identify high-risk subpopulations. This matched cohort study included women aged 15 to 58 years insured by the Japan Health Insurance Association. From April 2017 to March 2023, women newly diagnosed with breast, cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer were identified and matched in a 1:10 ratio to working women without these cancers. Cancer diagnosis was based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The primary outcome was all-cause resignation, and the secondary outcome was a composite of resignation and death, both assessed during a 2-year follow-up. Stratified Cox proportional-hazards models were applied, with multiple imputation and covariate adjustments. Subgroup analyses by prespecified covariates assessed effect size moderation and interactions between exposure and these covariates. The study included 99 964 women with cancer, including 59 452 women with breast cancer (median [IQR] age, 48 [44-53] years), 14 713 women with cervical cancer (median [IQR] age, 46 [39-51] years), 16 933 women with uterine cancer (median [IQR] age, 49 [44-53 years]), and 8866 women with ovarian cancer (median age [IQR] age, 47 [40-52] years), as well as 999 640 matched controls (594 520 for the breast cancer cohort, 147 130 for the cervical cancer cohort, 169 330 for the uterine cancer cohort, and 88 660 for the ovarian cancer cohort). Most women with cancer were working in the medical, health care, or welfare sector (32 123 women [32.1%]). During follow-up, resignation rates were significantly higher for women with cancer vs controls (breast cancer: 10 820 women [18.2%] vs 97 892 women [16.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16-1.20; cervical cancer: 3296 women [22.4%] vs 27 476 women [18.7%]; HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.26-1.36; uterine cancer: 3161 women [18.7%] vs 27 786 women [16.4%]; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; ovarian cancer: 2004 women [22.6%] vs 15 847 women [17.9%]; HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.37-1.51). Regarding the composite outcome of resignation and death, there was an increased risk for all cohorts, ranging from an HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.22-1.27) for breast cancer to 1.81 (95% CI, 1.73-1.89) for ovarian cancer. Among all 4 cancer cohorts, resignation risk was higher among women with older age, lower income, and a history of depression. In this cohort study using a nationwide health claims database in Japan, breast and gynecologic cancers were associated with a higher resignation risk, especially among those with older age, lower income, and depression history. These findings suggest that developing targeted support interventions may benefit women at high resignation risk after a cancer diagnosis.",

However, language barriers are common in case with less spoken languages, making communication challenging. We aimed to design and validate a set of illustrations addressing these key topics.MethodsThe design of the pictures was led by three pharmacists, focusing on three topics: general information (medication history), problems detection (AE of anticancer treatments, HDI) and the proper use of supportive care (e.g., mouthwash). Illustrations were created using Canva<sup>®</sup> (Canva Pty Ltd, Perth, Australia). Each card underwent a two-step validation process: an on-site evaluation (Wooclap<sup>®</sup> (Bruxelles, Belgium) for agreement/disagreement with recommendations), followed by a broader validation involving a multidisciplinary panel including oncologists, general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and patients- using a 9-point Likert scale on a Google<sup>®</sup> Form (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA).ResultsA total of 53 cards were initially evaluated by 19 pharmacists who fully approved 18 of them and provided recommendations for the others. Subsequently, a panel of 27 respondents rated the 53 cards. After the first round, the mean score was 7.37 ± 1.2, with all but five cards receiving a score >6 and being validated. The clarity of four cards (weight variation, HDI, dry skin, neuropathy) was improved while one (St John's wort) was ultimately removed. The four revised cards were then resubmitted and received approval.ConclusionsA final set of 52 validated cards will help enhance pharmaceutical care for cancer patients facing language barriers.",

    "abstract": "The lower all-cause mortality in women with Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared with the general population has been hypothesized to be due to a \"healthy-user effect,\" but this has not been studied in large cohorts. In a population-based, retrospective cohort study comprising 18,942 women with primary DCIS between 1999 and 2015 in the Netherlands, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer death (BCD) was estimated using death by other cause as a competing risk. The cause-specific mortality risk of women with DCIS was compared with that of the Dutch female population. Multivariable competing risk regression was used to quantify the effects of the method of detection and socio-economic status (SES). With 289 BCDs, the 10-year cumulative incidence of BCD was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1-1.5). Compared to the Dutch female population, women with DCIS had a 2.1-times higher risk of BCD, but a 7% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Women with screen-detected DCIS had lower risks of BCD compared to women with non-screen-detected DCIS (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]:0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.77), as did women with high SES versus low SES (sHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.97) in the first 4 years of follow-up, adjusted for age and year at diagnosis, and DCIS characteristics. In conclusion, overall mortality in women with DCIS is not higher compared to the Dutch female population, though death due to invasive breast cancer is increased. Within all women with DCIS, those with screen-detected DCIS or high SES had lower BCD and all-cause mortality, suggesting a healthy-user effect.",

This study aimed to determine whether distinct early post-discharge pain trajectories could be identified in patients with stage IA NSCLC undergoing thoracoscopic sublobar resection. The data were collected from a longitudinal prospective observational cohort (CN-PRO-Lung 3). Pain severity was rated using a 0-10 scale, with assessments conducted before surgery and daily after discharge for up to 30 days. Post-discharge pain trajectories were identified using the latent class mixed model. Potential risk factors associated with different pain trajectory were explored, including preoperative clinical characteristics, body composition metrics derived from chest computed tomography, surgical methods, and postoperative clinical outcomes. A total of 439 patients were selected in the trajectory analysis. One trajectory comprised 65 patients (14.8%, unrecovered group) who experienced persistent moderated post-discharge pain, while the other comprised 374 patients (85.2%, recovered group) with mild post-discharge pain and a declining trend. The independent predictors for the unrecovered post-discharge pain trajectory included the subcutaneous fat index (odds ratio [OR] 1.031, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.055, p = 0.010), preoperative pain severity (OR 1.428, 95% CI 1.102-1.851, p = 0.007), and hospital stay (OR 1.166, 95% CI 1.012-1.345, p = 0.034). Patients with stage IA NSCLC undergoing thoracoscopic sublobar resection had two different early post-discharge pain trajectories.

In this retrospective study, data from patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent RARP between December 2012 and August 2024 (n = 530) were analyzed. Patients with EBL of 100 ml or less were defined as group 1 (n = 359), and those with EBL exceeding 100 ml were defined as group 2 (n = 166). Perioperative data and postoperative functional and pathologic outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups. The patients in group 2 had longer lymph node dissection time, prostatectomy time, anastomosis time, total operation time, drain removal time, and hospital stay, as well a greater EBL, higher surgical margin ratio, greater positive surgical margin according to pathologic stage, and longer time to reach continence (p = 0.001). No difference was observed between urinary incontinence (UI) scores at the sixth month postoperatively (p = 0.191). A high degree of correlation was observed between EBL and other parameters (drain removal time, hospital length of stay, time to reach continence, prostatectomy time, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire [ICIQ] total score at the first and third months, and total operation and anastomosis time, respectively; rho-factor ≥ 0.5; p < 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, EBL was determined to be a predictive factor for achieving postoperative urinary continence. The study demonstrated that perioperative EBL is associated with postoperative urinary continence and oncologic outcomes after RARP.",

Despite advancements in understanding its molecular mechanisms, effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets remain elusive. This study utilizes a multi-omics approach to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. A multi-omics framework integrating druggable genomics, Mendelian randomization (MR), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed. Druggable genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci data, and therapeutic targets were predicted through MR analysis. These targets were cross-referenced with mesothelioma-specific single-cell markers and validated by summary data-based MR and protein quantitative trait loci analysis. Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to explore functional mechanisms. Drug sensitivity was assessed with the GDSC2 dataset, and potential therapeutic compounds were identified through molecular docking simulations using the Drug Signature Database. Mediated MR analysis investigated 731 immune cells and 1,400 metabolites as mediators of the identified genes' effects on mesothelioma. CYTL1 and H6PD were identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. CYTL1 was associated with poor prognosis and reduced drug sensitivity, while H6PD showed the opposite trend. Although molecular docking results for H6PD were unfavorable, compounds targeting CYTL1 were identified. Immune cells did not mediate the effects of either gene on mesothelioma progression, despite their prognostic associations. Metabolic mediation analysis revealed that CYTL1 influences mesothelioma via levulinoylcarnitine levels, whereas H6PD regulates tumor metabolism through the mannose-to-mannitol-to-sorbitol ratio and glutamate-to-5-oxoproline ratio. This study identifies CYTL1 and H6PD as key regulators of tumor metabolism in mesothelioma. CYTL1 is a promising therapeutic target, warranting further investigation, while H6PD remains a potential candidate despite unfavorable docking results.

Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing utilization of testing by cancer type, age group, race, and year. Among commercially insured women with newly diagnosed breast cancer (n = 19,139) or epithelial ovarian cancer (n = 1639), 50 and 47%, respectively, received germline BRCA testing during the study years. BRCA testing rates were higher among women with breast cancer aged 18-50 years (69%) compared to those aged 51-64 years (39%).

We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer at a tertiary center between April 2013 and August 2024. Preoperative HRQOL domains-physical (PF), role (RF), and emotional functioning (EF)-were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Patients were stratified based on PF scores (≥ 90 vs. <90), and propensity score matching was applied. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models. Overall, 276 patients were included. Patients with PF scores ≥ 90 had significantly higher 5-year OS (80.4% vs. 55.5%, p = 0.003) and lower recurrence rates. Low PF scores were an independent predictor of worse OS (HR: 2.54, 95% CI 1.42-4.55, p = 0.002). RF scores also influenced OS, while EF scores showed no association with survival. Preoperative PF and RF scores provide valuable prognostic information for patients undergoing RC. Given the modifiable nature of PF, prehabilitation programs could improve outcomes.

In such cases, meso-caval shunt (MCS) emerges as a solution. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of permanent MCS as both an emergency procedure and a planned surgical strategy. We retrospectively analyzed 8 consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with permanent MCS between July 2019 and January 2025 at our institution. Clinicopathological characteristics were identified using electronic medical records, and the same surgeon performed all surgeries. The study included seven cases of pancreatic cancer and one ampullary carcinoma (6 male, 2 females; age 54-71 years). The mean operative duration was 510 min with 767 ml blood loss. All patients achieved R0 resection with minor complications (Clavien-Dindo grade I/II), no mortality, and preserved portal perfusion. Meso-caval shunt patency was confirmed postoperatively without hepatic dysfunction. Median survival reached 21 months. Permanent MCS is a reliable elective option for venous reconstruction in pancreaticoduodenectomy, especially when graft-based solutions are not available. Its success in achieving R0 resection while maintaining portal hemodynamics suggests its utility in complex pancreatic resections.",

Of 69 patients (37 men and 32 women) (median age, 55 years; IQR: 48-66), 23 (33%) had pN+ status; 46 (67%) had pN- status. ADC<sub>mean</sub> (in × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) of the most suspicious lymph node was not different between the two patient groups (junior reader: 1087 vs. 926, p = 0.31; senior reader: 1178 vs. 1086, p = 0.89). The Dutch criteria, based on the combination of T2WI size and morphologic parameters, showed better diagnostic performance for the senior vs. junior reader: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 79.7% (95% CI: 68.3-88.4%), 56.5% (95% CI: 34.5-76.8%), 91.3% (95% CI: 79.2-97.6%), 76.5% (95% CI: 50.1-93.2%), and 80.8% (95% CI: 67.5-90.4%), vs. 69.6% (95% CI: 57.3-80.1%), 26.1% (95% CI: 12.2-48.4%), 91.3% (95% CI: 79.2-97.6%), 60% (95% CI: 26.2-97.8%), and 71.2% (95% CI: 57.9-82.2%). Additional research on alternative and more objective methods for lymph node characterization is needed. Question The performance of MRI for nodal staging in clinical early rectal cancer in particular is a knowledge gap in the literature. Findings The Dutch criteria, based on T2WI size and morphologic parameters, performed better in differentiating metastatic from benign lymph nodes than the quantitative DWI ADC parameter. Clinical relevance Accurate nodal staging in early rectal cancer is crucial for treatment decision-making. Our study highlights the need for additional research on alternative and more objective methods for lymph node characterization.",

DARC has been implicated in various aspects of cancer progression, including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. By analyzing the expression patterns of these markers in breast cancer tissues, we aim to understand their collective impact on tumor behaviour and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal complex interactions between DARC and these molecular markers, suggesting their synergistic roles in promoting or repressing breast cancer progression. Understanding these relationships could lead to developing more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Lipid homeostasis dysregulation in oral cancer drives metabolic reprogramming and offers novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.",
    "abstract": "Oral cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) being the predominant histological type. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of metabolic reprogramming in oral carcinogenesis, particularly alterations in lipid homeostasis that contribute to disease progression and development. This review synthesizes current knowledge on lipid metabolism dysregulation in oral cancer, focusing on key aspects of metabolic reprogramming mechanisms, serum lipid profile alterations, lipid peroxidation pathways, immunometabolic interactions, and emerging therapeutic strategies. Mechanistically, OSCC exhibits significant alterations in key lipid metabolic enzymes, including upregulation of fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase, and downregulation of carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), collectively promoting tumor growth and metastasis. These enzymatic changes are orchestrated through complex signaling pathways, notably the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, and manifest in altered membrane lipid composition, particularly within lipid microdomains that influence both cell signaling and drug resistance. Clinically, OSCC patients demonstrate characteristic serum lipid profile alterations, including reduced levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and specific apolipoproteins, which show promise as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. Furthermore, enhanced lipid peroxidation through reactive oxygen species presents a double-edged sword in carcinogenesis, with oxidation products like malondialdehyde both contributing to mutagenesis and serving as potential diagnostic indicators. The complex interplay between lipid metabolism and tumor immunity, particularly through CD36 and sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling pathways, creates opportunities for immunometabolic interventions. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism include lipid-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems, metabolic enzyme inhibitors, and immunometabolic modulators, with promising preclinical results. Despite significant advances, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications, necessitating further research on combination therapies, biomarker validation, and personalized treatment approaches. This comprehensive review provides valuable insights for both basic researchers and clinicians, potentially facilitating the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for oral cancer management.",

Although guidelines exist, pain management in the clinical setting remains inadequate. It is unclear why this gap in practice persists. This study aimed to explore the practice and experience of pain management by haemophilia healthcare professionals (HCPs) to better understand perceived competency and barriers/facilitators to appropriate care. European HCPs working ≥ 3 years in haemophilia care were invited to participate (haematologists, nurses, physiotherapists and psychosocial professionals). Data were collected using profession-specific focus groups and semi-structured individual interviews, recorded and transcribed. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Twenty-three HCPs (6 haematologists, 7 nurses, 6 physiotherapists, 4 psychosocial professionals) from 10 European countries agreed to participate. Four themes were constructed: (1) Defining who is responsible: the challenges in multidisciplinary team provision for good pain management; (2) the concept of pain and its management exists in multiple temporalities; (3) aspirations for better pain management are limited by prevailing biomedicalism; (4) pain management can be better-knowledge and experience improves confidence. These data demonstrate a gap in confidence in the delivery of effective pain management, influenced by individual knowledge and skills and wider geographical determinants of healthcare delivery. There is a need for services to establish who is responsible for pain management and better understand professional role identity. Mechanisms to support the implementation of better pain care in haemophilia need to be explored.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated recurrence-free survival (RFS) as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival (OS) in esophageal cancer. OS is regarded as the gold-standard efficacy endpoint of oncological treatments but requires long follow-up. An integrated analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from phase III trials comparing perioperative therapies for resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer was conducted. Surrogacy between RFS and OS was assessed at the individual level using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (τ) and at the trial level using the coefficient of determination (R²). A τ of 0.8 and an R² of 0.65 were considered thresholds for a good surrogate. Twenty-two eligible trials were identified, and IPD were available from 10 randomized trials, including 2,145 patients who underwent R0 resection. The 5-year OS and RFS rates were 53.2% and 46.2%, with median OS of 6.2 and RFS of 3.6 years. For individual-level surrogacy, Kendall's τ was 0.823 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.807-0.839). Subgroup analysis by treatment modality revealed τ values of 0.830 (95% CI: 0.800-0.861) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC; n=586), and 0.827 (95% CI: 0.803-0.850) for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT; n=982). Trial-level surrogacy analysis across all 22 trials demonstrated an R2 of 0.735 (95% CI: 0.512-0.939). The surrogate threshold effect was 0.929. This study demonstrated strong individual- and trial-level surrogacy between RFS and OS in resectable esophageal cancer across all perioperative treatments.

    "abstract": "Melanoma, the fifth most common cancer in the US, has increased from 8.8 per 100 000 in 1975 to 28.42 per 100 000 in 2022. Cutaneous melanoma comprises 94% of cases, with 104 960 US cases projected for 2025. Cutaneous melanoma presents as a new, changing, or irregularly pigmented skin lesion. Cutaneous melanoma subtypes include superficial spreading (≈70%), lentigo maligna (≈15%), nodular (≈5%), desmoplastic (≈4%), amelanotic (2%-8%), spitzoid (<2%), and acral (≈1%). Risk factors for cutaneous melanoma include UV radiation exposure, skin type (eg, skin that always burns, never tans), presence of benign and atypical nevi, and personal or family history of melanoma. Primary prevention consists of avoiding direct sunlight and indoor tanning, and photoprotection (sunscreen and sun-protective clothing). Based on United States Cancer Statistics data from 1999 to 2021, 77% of patients with cutaneous melanoma had localized disease (involving only the primary site), 9.5% had regional (nodal) disease, 4.7% had distant metastasis, and 8.8% were unstaged. Melanoma staging, which includes tumor thickness and ulceration and presence of lymph node or distant metastasis, ranges from stage 0 (melanoma in situ) to stage IV (distant metastasis). Localized melanoma (stage IA-IIA) is surgically excised, with margins of 0.5 cm to 2 cm based on depth of invasion. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended for cutaneous melanoma that is ulcerated or 0.8 mm or more thick. Following surgery, patients with stage IIB-C melanoma have improved recurrence-free survival with adjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or death, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79] for pembrolizumab and 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30-0.59] for nivolumab). For stage III disease, recurrence risk is decreased with nivolumab (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.86]), pembrolizumab (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.72]), or BRAF + MEK inhibitor therapy (dabrafenib + trametinib) (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.43-0.63]). First-line treatment for distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma is dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab. In 2017, 10-year melanoma-specific survival rates were 98% to 94% for stage IA-B, 88% to 75% for stage IIA-C, 88% for stage IIIA, 77% to 60% for stage IIIB-C, and 24% for stage IIID. In 2024, patients with distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab had a 10-year overall survival rate of 43%. Melanoma is a common cancer in the US. Treatment for stage IA-IIA melanoma is surgical resection. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy after surgical excision improves recurrence-free survival in stages IIB-C melanoma. For stage III melanoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or BRAF + MEK inhibitor therapy decreases risk of melanoma recurrence. First-line therapy for metastatic melanoma is dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab.",

Between March 2015 and February 2023, 401 early-stage (T1-2 N0 M0) primary lung cancer patients were treated using either LINACs (Varian VitalBeam® and TrueBeam®; Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or CyberKnife® (Accuray, Madison, WI, USA). Median age was 70 years (range 44-90). Diagnosis was based on biopsy for 37.4% of patients, while pathological confirmation was unavailable due to high risk for 62.6%. <sup>18</sup>F‑fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) was part of the pretreatment diagnostic workup in 96% (n = 386) of the total cohort. Tumor stage distribution was T1a in 32 (8%), T1b in 179 (44.6%), T1c in 112 (27.9%), T2a in 67 (16.7%), and T2b in 11 (2.7%) patients. Applied dose schemes were identical for both LINAC and CyberKnife treatments, using risk-adapted doses of 45-60 Gy in 3 to 8 fractions, (biologically effective dose ranging from 86 to 151.2 Gy BED<sub>10</sub>). At a median follow-up of 32 months (range 2-104), the crude survival rate was 58%. Median overall survival (OS) was 63 months (95% CI: 51.1-74.8) the 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑year OS rates were 79, 68, and 56%, respectively. Actuarial local control (LC) rates were 94% at 2 years, 90% at 3 years, and 87% at 4 years. Median LC was not reached. Median local progression-free survival (LPFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 49.5 months (95% CI: 42.8-56.3) and 37 months (95% CI: 31.2.-42.8), respectively. Actuarial 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑year LPFS and PFS rates were 75, 60, and 51% and 66, 51, and 42%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, BED<sub>10</sub> ≥ 132 Gy predicted improved LPFS, while earlier tumor stage and better ECOG performance status were associated with improved OS. No grade 3 or higher acute side effects were observed. Grade 3 late side effects occurred in 4 patients (1%), including grade 3 late pulmonary fibrosis in 3 cases and potentially treatment-related grade 3 pneumothorax in 1 patient. Rib fracture was observed in 14 cases (3%). Clinical results after SBRT at a national comprehensive cancer center demonstrate high LC and LPFS rates and favorable PFS and OS, comparable to published studies. Application of a BED<sub>10</sub> of 132 Gy or higher shows a potential benefit in terms of LPFS and may thus be recommended in the absence of conflict with organ at risk constraints. SBRT with either LINAC or CK is proven to be a well-tolerated but still highly effective treatment for the elderly, medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer population.",

    "abstract": "Surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy represents the primary therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma, yet significant challenges remain in preventing postoperative tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Herein, an engineered sandwich-structured hydrogel scaffold (sandwich/MTO-CuHCF) loading copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CuHCF) and mitoxantrone (MTO) with multimodal therapy was developed by using in situ stacked 3D-printing technology. The sandwich architecture provided distinct compartmentalization of therapeutic agents, thereby mitigating the risk of physicochemical incompatibility. Upon implantation of the sandwich/MTO-CuHCF scaffold at the tumor resection site, CuHCF and MTO were sequentially and sustainably released. On one hand, CuHCF depleted intracellular glutathione and catalyzed a Fenton-like reaction to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, leading to effective cancer cell killing. On the other hand, the subsequently released MTO, an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent, induced DNA damage in tumor cells. Notably, the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of sandwich/MTO-CuHCF under near-infrared irradiation not only enhanced the Fenton-like reaction through localized hyperthermia but also facilitated photothermal ablation of osteosarcoma cells. Remarkably, in a mouse osteosarcoma resection model, scaffold implantation significantly inhibited tumor recurrence. Our study provides a conceptual framework for the development of implantable scaffolds to achieve effective suppression of postoperative tumor recurrence.",

This study presents a case of acromioclavicular joint infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis BCG, alongside a systematic review aimed at improving our understanding of the infection's clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes. This systematic review included all published cases of osteoarticular infections due to M. bovis BCG following intravesical BCG instillation, as identified through a PubMed search conducted up to 1 May 2025. The search used combinations of keywords related to 'BCG', 'bladder', and 'osteoarticular infection'. One additional case from our institution was added. Clinical, biological, radiological, treatment and outcome data were extracted and analyzed. We reviewed 67 cases, classified as vertebral (n = 45), prosthetic joint (n = 18), and native joint (n = 4). The affected patients were predominantly men (98.5%), with a mean age of 74.1 ± 9.2 years. The median delay in months between the first instillation and the diagnosis was 23 [IQR 13.0-48.0]. Fever was uncommon (20.5%), while elevated C-reactive protein levels were frequent (80%). Imaging (CT/MRI) played a key role in diagnosis by showing images consistent with infection in all cases in which it was used. Treatment typically involved rifampicin and isoniazid for 12 months, alongside ethambutol for two months. Outcomes were favorable in 90.6% of cases, with one death attributed to the infection. Though rare, M. bovis BCG osteoarticular infections should be considered in patients with unexplained joint symptoms following BCG therapy.

We collected clinical data from patients who underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction at the Department of Breast, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between December 2019 and December 2023. We analyzed the incidence of postoperative complications and their relationship with patient clinical data and surgical parameters. We also used the BREAST-Q 2.0 Chinese version scale to assess the impact of postoperative complications on patient-reported outcomes. A total of 109 patients underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction, including 91 stage I reconstructions and 18 stage II reconstructions. Postoperative complications occurred in 26 cases (23.9%), including flap complications in 13 cases (11.9%) and abdominal donor-site complications in 13 cases (11.9%). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the overall incidence of complications was associated with high BMI and early surgery (P < 0.05). Flap complications were associated with high BMI, early surgery, and the use of internal mammary vascular branches as recipient vessels (P < 0.05). Abdominal complications were associated with previous abdominal surgery scars (P < 0.05). Approximately 20% of patients did not complete the BREAST-Q questionnaires (including the two patients who experienced total flap loss). BREAST-Q scores showed no significant differences between the surgical complication group and the no-complication group in terms of breast satisfaction, mental health, physical health-chest, physical health-abdomen, satisfaction with abdomen, sexual health, etc. (P > 0.05).

In collaboration with community partners, individuals identifying with each community were purposively selected to participate in this study. Fifteen focus groups, ranging in size from 7 to 12 participants, and two key informant interviews were conducted with individuals from Asian and Pacific Islander, Caribbean, and African communities in the United States (total n = 101). The Health Belief Model and Social Ecological Model guided initial codebook development, with inductive approaches capturing emergent themes identified during analysis. Participants described incomplete knowledge of hepatitis B transmission and its link to liver cancer within their communities. These influenced health beliefs and behaviors surrounding screening and care, shaping feelings of self-efficacy and uncertainty regarding prevention and management. Misperceptions about disease risk and management were reproduced within interpersonal relationships, with many describing stigma and social isolation. Family support and culturally embedded social norms were influential in healthcare decisions and seeking. This study demonstrates the multi-level influences contributing to low rates of screening and care engagement across impacted communities, highlighting key differences and similarities.

Forty primary transitional cell bladder samples and 20 adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from patients at Al-Assad University Hospital in Damascus between March 2023 and January 2024. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess HMGA2 protein levels. The relationship between HMGA2 tissue levels and clinical variables was analyzed using the Chi-Square Independence Test. This study showed that HMGA2 protein was overexpressed in 70% of bladder cancer tissues, with no expression in normal tissues. Also, a High HMGA2 levels were noticed to be significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, higher tumor grade, and muscle invasion (p < 0.05). No significant association was found between HMGA2 levels and gender or smoking habits.

TME of solid tumors contains factors exerting a range of effects on Tregs including development, recruitment, expansion, stability and their immunosuppressive activity. Anti-PD-1 secondarily causes replenishment of intratumoral Tregs, which further intensify tumor immunosuppression. Besides, Treg depletion may also compromise immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy in addition to its other adversarial effects. Thus, a desired ICI booster is to use agents preferentially acting on intratumoral Tregs. Modulation of hypoxia, and regulation of Treg-related cytokines, chemokines, receptors and chromatin modifying factors in tumor TME provide supplementary approaches to anti-PD-(L)1.

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterised by the uncontrolled proliferation of clonal plasma cells, primarily within the bone marrow, and is still considered incurable. A significant proportion of patients relapse with drug-refractory disease, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Ferroptosis is a recently-characterised form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, linked to phospholipid peroxidation, that represents a promising approach for the treatment of MM and other cancers, that are refractory to more conventional apoptosis-inducing regimens. A better understanding of the relationship between cellular lipid composition and ferroptosis sensitivity is key to harnessing this form of programmed cell death as a therapeutic approach. In addition to the cellular proportions of phospholipids containing poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids, studies to date indicate that cholesterol levels impact not only the onset and progression of haematological malignancies but also the sensitivity of a variety of different cancers to ferroptosis. Therefore, manipulating the uptake and metabolism of lipids, including glycerophospholipids and cholesterol, may be an effective means of sensitising MM cells to ferroptosis. Findings from the limited number of studies concerning ferroptosis in MM and compelling evidence from other malignancies, provide a strong rationale for further investigation of ferroptosis as a novel therapeutic approach for MM.",

However, there are few studies on the role of cholesterol metabolism in the occurrence and development of thyroid cancer (THCA). This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of cholesterol metabolism-related genes (CMRGs) in THCA and the relationship between immune invasion and drug sensitivity. Cholesterol metabolism-related genes we identified from the molecular signatures database, and univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO) were used to construct a predictive model of cholesterol metabolism-related genes based on the TCGA-THCA dataset. The TCGA dataset was randomly divided into a training group and a validation group to verify the model's predictive value and independent prognostic effect. We then constructed a nomogram and performed enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration, and drug sensitivity analysis. Finally, TCGA-THCA and GSE33630 datasets were used to detect the expression of signature genes, which was further verified by the HPA database. Six CMRGs (FADS1, NPC2, HSD17B7, ACSL4, APOE, HMGCS2) we identified by univariate Cox and LASSO regression to construct a prognostic model for 155 genes related to cholesterol metabolism. Their prognostic value was confirmed in the validation set, and a highly accurate nomogram was constructed combined with clinical features. We found that the mortality rate of high-risk patients increased by 11.41 times, and the infiltration of immune cells in the high-risk group was significantly reduced. Moreover, through drug sensitivity analysis, we obtained sensitive drugs for different risk groups. The GSE33630 dataset verified the expression of six CMRGs, and the HPA database verified the protein expression of the NPC2 gene. Cholesterol metabolism-related features are a promising biomarker for predicting THCA prognosis and can potentially guide personalized immunization and targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic (As) contamination in rice poses significant health risks due to the toxicity of certain arsenicals. This study presents an improved, time-efficient method for quantifying arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>), arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) in commercial white and brown rice using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The method incorporates chromatographic modifiers and ion-pairing agents in the mobile phase, reducing overall retention time to less than 4 minutes while enhancing peak separation. Method optimization, focusing on the solid-to-liquid ratio (g/L) and extraction time (minutes), was validated using the certified reference material (SRM 1568b Rice Flour), with measured concentrations showing good agreement with certified values. The MMA was excluded from the final analysis due to its low concentration in rice samples and minimal risk contribution. Arsenic species in rice followed the trend As<sup>III</sup> > DMA > As<sup>V</sup>. No significant association was found between As levels and country of origin, but certain brown (MR 27, MR 29) and white (MR 10, MR 14) rice samples exceeded the European Commission's limit for inorganic As. Health risk assessments showed all rice samples had a target hazard quotient above 1, indicating potential non-carcinogenic risks. Additionally, estimated cancer risks exceeded the 10<sup>-3</sup> (1 in 1000 lifetime risk) threshold under the revised cancer slope factor (CSF) value. This optimized method offers a reliable approach for detecting and quantifying As species in rice, aiding food safety monitoring and regulatory efforts.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and there is mounting evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematologic malignancies as well as treatment resistance. Macrophages play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage mediated phagocytosis has recently emerged as a key player in blood cancers. The integrin associated protein CD47 is expressed in a variety of cancers and interacts with its ligand, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in down regulation of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is highly expressed in various cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). It is therefore postulated that blockade of the CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint has the potential to 're-awaken' macrophage mediated phagocytosis of MM plasma cells. In this review, we provide our perspective on the key pre-clinical data supporting the CD47-SIRPα axis as a therapeutic target in MM. We subsequently discuss the ongoing clinical trials which may provide the basis for future clinical translation of these agents. We also highlight key gaps in our knowledge of macrophage biology in MM which need to be addressed by future research. Finally, we present potential future directions for translational research and personalized application of macrophage-based immunotherapy in MM.",

    "abstract": "There are multiple pathologic subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), each with distinct clinical prognoses. However, the available data on the clinicopathologic risks associated with several common PTC subtypes are controversial and require more comprehensive evaluation. To address this, we conducted a systematic search of English-language databases, including PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, for studies on six PTC subtypes, including classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (CPTC), papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC), tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (TCVPTC), diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC), and columnar cell papillary thyroid carcinoma (CCVPTC). Our case-control study of clinicopathological prognostic analyses of six subtypes, with a search date of January 2000 to May 2024. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias according to set criteria. R software gemtc package, Stata 15.1 software were applied to perform reticulated Meta-analysis methods were applied to compare the clinicopathological features and prognostic assessment of classic papillary thyroid carcinoma and the other five subtypes in all the studies.The risk of distant metastasis was higher in patients with CCVPTC, TCVPTC, and DSVPTC than in CPTC.FVPTC and PTMC exhibit a lower risk of in situ tumor relapse compared to CPTC. The tumour size of TCVPTC was significantly larger than that of CPTC, while there was no significant difference in the tumour size of CCV, DSV, FVPTC, CPTC and PTMC. DSVPTC was significantly more multifocal than the other subtypes. This network meta-analysis confirms the aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis associated with TCVPTC, DSVPTC, and CCVPTC. Therefore, these subtypes should be managed aggressively with total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection if diagnosed preoperatively. In contrast, FVPTC and PTMC are less aggressive and have a better prognosis, suggesting that treatment and follow-up strategies for PTC should be tailored according to the histopathological subtype.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is traditionally viewed as a risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes. This study evaluated whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) independently affected intraoperative and postoperative outcomes following colon cancer resection, and whether these effects varied by anatomical site. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent colon cancer resection at a single institution from 2015 to 2022. Patients were stratified by BMI (≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and further grouped by urgency (elective or emergency) and anatomical subsite (right- vs left-sided). Primary outcomes were intraoperative complications, severe postoperative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥ III), conversion to open surgery, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among the 737 patients, 33.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30). Obese patients were younger and had higher rates of hypertension (55% vs 46%, p = 0.01), diabetes (25% vs 16%, p < 0.01), and respiratory disease (22% vs 11%, p < 0.01). In the overall cohort, obesity was not associated with increased rates of intraoperative complications, severe postoperative complications, conversion to open surgery, or 30-day mortality. In elective resections, obesity was independently associated with increased likelihood of ICU admission (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.08-3.09; p = 0.02), while in emergent resections obesity was independently associated with higher intra-operative complications (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.19-3.97; p = 0.01). Stratified analysis by resection site revealed that obesity was an independent risk factor associated with intraoperative complications (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.47; p = 0.04) and ICU admission (aOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.61-6.23; p < 0.01) following left-sided colectomy, but not right-sided surgery. Obesity was not associated with adverse outcomes following colon cancer surgery overall. However, when stratified by anatomical subsite, obesity was independently associated with increased perioperative risk in left-sided resections. These findings support a more nuanced approach to operative planning and perioperative risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is poor. Therefore, searching for new therapeutic agents is particularly important to improve therapeutic efficacy. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating DLBCL. In this study, we investigated the role of the deubiquitase inhibitor Spautin-1 in the treatment of DLBCL. Spautin-1 significantly inhibited the growth of DLBCL, including the growth of cells and transplanted tumors in mice. Notably, Spautin-1 showed enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent versus immunodeficient mice models, mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and activation. Mechanistically, Spautin-1 promotes PANoptosis by inducing mitochondrial damage mediated by USP13-ACLY inhibition in DLBCL cells, which in turn induces the release of injury-related molecular patterns and cytokines. Moreover, high USP13 expression in DLBCL is associated with poor prognosis and blocks CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. In summary, Spautin-1 may inhibit the growth of DLBCL cells by promoting mitochondrial damage-mediated PANoptosis and anti-tumor immunity, providing a potential strategy for DLBCL therapy.",

NETs are extremely rare and appear to behave similarly to NETs of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, SCNECs and LCNECs are aggressive tumors with important clinical relevance, as they have a poor prognosis and require aggressive treatment.Therapy-associated neuroendocrine prostate carcinomas (t-NEPC) are recognized as a distinct entity for the first time in the WHO classification (5th edition, 2022). It arises through transdifferentiation via epigenetic changes following androgen deprivation and is characterized by AR loss and high proliferation, among other features. As with primary NE carcinomas, aggressive therapy is indicated. Therefore, a follow-up biopsy is recommended for castration-resistant progressive prostate cancer to confirm this aggressive phenotype.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether deep learning (DL)-based image quality (IQ) assessment of T2-weighted images (T2WI) could be biased by the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). In this three-center retrospective study, five abdominal radiologists categorized IQ of 2,105 transverse T2WI series into optimal, mild, moderate, and severe degradation. An IQ classification model was developed using 1,719 series (development set). The agreement between the model and radiologists was assessed using the remaining 386 series with a quadratic weighted kappa. The model was applied to 11,723 examinations that were not included in the development set and without documented prostate cancer at the time of MRI (patient age, 65.5 ± 8.3 years [mean ± standard deviation]). Examinations categorized as mild to severe degradation were used as target groups, whereas those as optimal were used to construct matched control groups. Case-control matching was performed to mitigate the effects of pre-MRI confounding factors, such as age and prostate-specific antigen value. The proportion of patients with csPCa was compared between the target and matched control groups using the chi-squared test. The agreement between the model and radiologists was moderate with a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.53. The mild-moderate IQ-degraded groups had significantly higher csPCa proportions than the matched control groups with optimal IQ: moderate (N = 126) vs. optimal (N = 504), 26.3% vs. 22.7%, respectively, difference = 3.6% [95% confidence interval: 0.4%, 6.8%], p = 0.03; mild (N = 1,399) vs. optimal (N = 1,399), 22.9% vs. 20.2%, respectively, difference = 2.7% [0.7%, 4.7%], p = 0.008.

However, whether causal relationships exist among these associations remains unclear, as traditional observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors. To evaluate causal relationships between kidney cancer, kidney fibrosis, and inflammatory factors using Mendelian randomization, and explore tumor microenvironment heterogeneity through single-cell analysis. Based on large-scale GWAS data, bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to assess causal relationships between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis, using MR Egger, inverse variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods. Causal associations between kidney cancer and inflammatory factors including Axin-1, C-C motif chemokine 28, and interleukin-10 receptor subunit were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database (GSM4819725) was integrated for tumor microenvironment analysis. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis revealed no significant causal relationship between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis [kidney cancer→kidney fibrosis: IVW OR=0.992(95%CI: 0.913-1.077, P=0.842); kidney fibrosis→kidney cancer: IVW OR=0.922(95%CI: 0.824-1.030, P=0.151)]. However, significant positive causal associations were identified between kidney cancer and multiple inflammatory factors: Axin-1 levels [OR=1.448(95%CI: 1.107-1.894, P=0.007)], C-C motif chemokine 28 [OR=1.287(95%CI: 1.076-1.540, P=0.006)], and interleukin-10 receptor subunit [OR=1.135(95%CI: 1.032-1.248, P=0.009)]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results. Single-cell analysis revealed cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, including various cell types such as immune cells, T cells, and NK cells, with pseudotime analysis demonstrating cell differentiation trajectories and dynamic gene expression changes. Mendelian randomization analysis provides genetic evidence for causal relationships between kidney cancer and inflammatory factors, while excluding direct causal associations between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis.",

The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 6 (PTPN6), also known as SHP-1, plays a critical role in regulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways, with emerging evidence suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. Previous studies have linked aberrant PTPN6 expression to tumorigenesis in specific cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. However, the comprehensive role of PTPN6 across pan-cancer, particularly its prognostic significance and molecular functions, has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to provide a pan-cancer analysis of PTPN6, utilizing data from multiple public databases with molecular in vitro experiments. Our findings showed notable differences in PTPN6 expression among different cancer types. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher PTPN6 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in with notable upregulation in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ). Further, promoter methylation and mutation analyses highlighted alterations in PTPN6 expression across different cancer stages, with a particular reduction in methylation observed in tumor tissues. Functional assays in cell lines demonstrated that PTPN6 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, supporting its role in cancer progression. This comprehensive analysis emphasizes the potential of PTPN6 as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer.

Recently, NNMT has a role in methylation metabolism and tumorigenesis and was associated with a poor prognosis against numerous cancers. In addition, it has been reported that NNMT has been overexpressed in the stroma of advanced high-grade serous carcinoma and may contribute to decreased survival. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to predict resistance and investigate their clinicopathologic significance in paclitaxel-resistant advanced or recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). Fluorescence-labeled two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), immunohistochemical, and MASCOT analyses allowed us to identify the cytoplasmic metabolic enzyme NNMT. In cultured cell studies, NNMT protein expression was higher in paclitaxel-resistant OVMANA and OVTOKO cells than in paclitaxel-sensitive KK and ES-2 cells. Furthermore, although analysis of clinical tissue samples showed no association with poor prognosis in 7 individuals with low NNMT expression in the cytoplasm of OCCC cells, high expression of NNMT in the cytoplasm of OCCC cells may be associated with low sensitivity to paclitaxel in OCCC and may have prognostic implications. Therefore, targeting therapy to reduce cytoplasmic NNMT expression levels may increase the sensitivity of OCCC to paclitaxel.",

This study involves a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions, such as acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and moxibustion, in improving gastrointestinal function and quality of life in patients undergoing chemotherapy. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases up to March 13, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved the comparison of non-pharmacological TCM interventions with standard pharmacological treatments in adult patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Primary outcomes included the quality of life measured by the Karnofsky Performance Status scale, gastrointestinal function measured by complete response rates, and objective response rates. Data were analyzed using Bayesian network meta-analysis methods, with outcomes presented as odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) along with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). A total of 37 RCTs involving 3268 participants were included in the review. The findings highlighted the significant efficacy of specific TCM interventions. The top-ranked intervention for improving Karnofsky Performance Status scores was electroacupuncture at the Geshu point combined with medication, with a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value of 80.3%. For complete response rates, a combination of acupuncture, auricular point sticking, and medication emerged as the most effective method, with a SUCRA value of 88.0%.

Senescence is linked to chronic inflammation via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, activated by cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs) marked by histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3), is crucial for SASP production. This study investigates the potential of a natural flavonoid, Chrysin, as a senomorphic agent that targets these CCF markers to reduce inflammation in senescent breast cancer cells. We induced senescence in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells using doxorubicin and analyzed the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 after treatment with various concentrations of Chrysin through qRT-PCR. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed significantly reduced CCF markers H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, along with decreased STING phosphorylation. Notably, Chrysin did not change the expression of senescent markers p16 or p21. Additionally, Chrysin effectively inhibited SASP-driven breast cancer cell invasion and colony formation, highlighting its potential as both an anti-inflammatory agent and a senomorphic drug. Chrysin notably decreases H3K9me3 and H3K27me3-marked CCF levels, suppressing cGAS-STING pathway activation and reducing IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Our findings indicate that Chrysin represents a promising therapeutic strategy, targeting the epigenetic landscape of CCFs and modulating the SASP to mitigate the harmful effects of senescent cells in the tumor microenvironment.",

PTEN loss has emerged as a promising biomarker for predicting aggressive disease. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of PTEN status in patients diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 213 patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsy with available PTEN testing between 2020 and 2023 at a referral center. Patients who underwent RP with undetectable postoperative PSA levels and a minimum follow-up of three months were included. The primary outcome was the prognostic value of PTEN status. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test, while Cox regression models identified predictors of BCR. Overall, 36/213 (17%) patients exhibited PTEN loss. These patients had more aggressive disease, characterized by higher clinical stage and ISUP grade group (p ≤ 0.01). Among the 56 patients treated with RP and followed for a median of 25 months, BCR-free survival was significantly lower in those with PTEN loss, especially in the intermediate-risk subgroup (log-rank test, p = 0.03). PTEN loss was identified as an independent predictor of BCR (Hazard Ratio: 8.5, p = 0.03). PTEN loss in patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsy and treated with RP is associated with worse prognosis. PTEN testing shows promise as a biomarker to improve patient counseling and guide PCa treatment decisions. Prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings fully.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoma survivors may face an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but large-scale studies comprehensively assessing this risk are limited. This study aims to investigate the association between lymphoma and incident CVDs, and to explore differences across lymphoma subtypes and potential effect modifiers. This retrospective cohort study used UK Biobank data. 3,244 lymphoma patients were matched 1:5 to 16,208 non-cancer controls based on demographics, lifestyle, and health factors. Incident CVDs were ascertained from electronic health records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between lymphoma and each cardiovascular outcome, adjusting for key demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. After multivariable adjustment, lymphoma was significantly associated with increased risks of myocarditis/pericarditis (HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.26-4.63), heart failure/cardiomyopathy (HR: 2.65, 95% CI: 2.26-3.11), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.04), valve diseases (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.47-2.19), conduction system disease (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.37-1.98), supraventricular arrhythmias (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.17), peripheral arterial disease (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.18-1.84), and ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34). Risk varied significantly across lymphoma subtypes, with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral/cutaneous T-cell lymphomas exhibiting particularly elevated risks for several outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension status significantly modified some associations. Lymphoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of multiple CVDs. Findings highlight the need for cardiovascular risk assessment and tailored management in lymphoma survivors, considering subtype and individual risk factors.",

We thus examine the outcomes of PCNSL in a multiethnic Asian population treated with HD-MTX-based chemotherapy and consolidation WBRT, so as to benchmark current treatment outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study involving patients (n = 129) diagnosed with PCNSL at the National Cancer Centre Singapore from 2000 to 2019. The median follow-up duration was 47.0 months. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional models. The cohort consisted of 76 male and 53 female patients with a median age of 60 years. 85 patients received HD-MTX-based induction therapy as per DeAngelis, while 44 were treated with the Shah protocol. In univariate analyses, male sex, ECOG scores ≥ 1, non-germinal center subtype, use of DeAngelis protocol, and methotrexate dose < 3 g/m<sup>2</sup> were significantly correlated with worse PFS and OS. In a multivariate model, the Shah protocol conferred significantly improved outcomes as compared with the DeAngelis protocol for PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.73, p = 0.0019) and OS (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.59, p = 0.0004). Using gene expression profiling, poor risk PCNSL patients had a higher trend of CD8 T-cells, macrophages and Th-1 cells, upregulation of TIGIT and HAVCR2, and downregulation in WNT11 and CD44. Our study demonstrates that contemporary HD-MTX-based chemoimmunotherapy induction regimens achieve good disease responses in PCNSL.

SNMM frequently originates in the nasal cavity, causing nonspecific nasal symptoms that inevitably delay diagnosis. Left untreated, the tumor may extend into the orbit.Case DescriptionHerein, the authors describe two patients presenting with compressive optic neuropathy and were found to have advanced SNMM involving the orbit. Both patients presented with vision loss, decreased color vision, proptosis, conjunctival chemosis, and restricted extraocular movements. One patient was found to have a relative afferent pupillary defect. Neither patient was a surgical candidate, and both received palliative radiotherapy and immunotherapy.ConclusionsThese cases and literature review demonstrate the potential for the disease to initially manifest with orbital extension and ocular symptoms.

We investigated whether first-round FIT concentration could predict colorectal neoplasia detection in the second screening round, using data from the randomized controlled trial Screening of Swedish Colons (SCREESCO). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of SCREESCO FIT-arm participants with negative two-stool FIT (<10 μg Hb/g feces) in the first screening round, followed by a positive FIT (≥10 μg Hb/g feces) in the second round two years later with work-up colonoscopy. We used binary regression models to assess risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, including CRC and advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN), at colonoscopy, according to participants' characteristics and first- and second-round FIT concentrations. In total, 1,991 individuals were included, with median FIT concentrations of 2.2 and 21.8 μg Hb/g feces in the first and second rounds, respectively. Higher first-round FIT concentration was associated with increased risks of CRC and ACN in the second round. Compared to those with first-round FIT concentrations of 0.0-1.9 μg Hb/g feces, the risk ratios for ACN were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.07-1.80) for 2.0-5.9 and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.38-2.48) for 6.0-9.9 μg Hb/g feces. For fixed second-round FIT concentration, the absolute risk of ACN increased in accordance with higher first-round FIT concentration. Even an increase in low levels of FIT concentration is associated with future CRC and ACN detection. Combining first- and second-round FIT results could enhance the efficacy of screening.

A retrospective review of TSs between 2013 and 2023 was performed, with clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up data collected and analyzed. The patients were divided into two surgical groups, and tumours within each group were further classified according to the Samii system into middle fossa (type A), dumbbell-shaped involving middle and posterior fossae (type C), and extracranial with intracranial extension (type D), excluding posterior fossa (type B). A total of 101 patients (44 via EEA, 57 via TCA) were included. The two groups exhibited comparable baseline characteristics, except for the prevalence of dizziness in the pooled data (types A, C, and D). In pooled data and type A tumours, the EEA was associated with a statistically significant differences in higher gross total resection rate, shorter operative time, lower intracranial infection rate, and greater improvement in facial numbness. EEA was also significantly associated with a lower neurological deficits and higher Karnofsky Performance Scale scores in pooled data. Both approaches resulted in similar outcomes for type C tumours. EEA was advantageous for type D tumours in the infratemporal fossa, pterygopalatine fossa, and medial orbital regions, and no neurological deficits were observed.

In this article, we approach the topic critically and discuss the areas in which the development of microbiome-based clinical applications may soon be expected. We selectively review the literature on disease-associated microbiome signatures and therapeutic modulation of the microbiome. We discuss clinical studies as well as relevant preclinical studies that reveal causal relationships between the microbiome and disease. The intestinal microbiome undergoes dynamic regulation by lifestyle factors such as the diet. Particularly in inflammatory and malignant neoplastic diseases, changes in the microbiome have been identified that contribute to the progression of disease in animal models. Studies have also shown that the response to systemic antitumor therapy is regulated by the microbiota. In view of this, initial clinical trials have been conducted that document the efficacy of fecal microbiome transfer and of selective approaches to microbiome modulation in the treatment of several inflammatory and malignant diseases. Evidence from animal models and initial clinical studies indicates that therapeutic modulation of the microbiome can be of benefit to patients suffering from a number of inflammatory and malignant diseases. The further translation of research of this kind into clinical applications will require the validation of these data in controlled trials and the development of targeted approaches to microbiome modulation.",

This study aimed to explore associations between diverse folic acid fortification policies (mandatory vs. no mandatory fortification) and global late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC) incidence rates. The study systematically assessed (i) folic acid fortification policies in 193 member states of the World Health Organization, and (ii) age-standardized LOCRC incidence rates by country. We examined the associations between folic acid fortification types and LOCRC incidence using an ecological study design. Incidence trends before and after fortification were analyzed using a log-linear joinpoint regression model, and the annual percent change and average annual percent change with 95% confidence interval were determined for representative countries with mandatory fortification (the United States [U.S.] and Canada). By September 2024, 69 countries enacted mandatory folic acid fortification legislation, while 124 had no fortification. The overall LOCRC incidence rates per 100,000 were 70.8 and 84.0 with mandatory and no mandatory fortification, respectively. The decreasing trends after implementing folic acid fortification were more rapid than in the pre-fortification period in the U.S. and Canada. These findings suggested an association between mandatory folic acid fortification policies and reduced LOCRC incidence. These global data provide a scientific basis for transitioning fortification policies and inform strategies for cancer prevention through the fortification with folic acid.",

This meta-analysis evaluated the association between occupational benzene exposure and the risk of these cancers. A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE identified 7,221 publications, with nine cohort studies meeting inclusion criteria. Summary risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using PRISMA, MOOSE, and PECOS guidelines. Study quality was assessed with a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and publication bias was evaluated via Egger's test and funnel plots. The overall summary RR for benzene exposure was 1.22 (95% CI=1.03-1.44), primarily driven by mortality (RR=1.69; 95% CI=1.18-2.41) rather than incidence (RR=1.08; 95% CI=0.91-1.29). Cancer-specific RRs were 1.24 for cervical, 1.21 for endometrial, and 1.28 for ovarian cancers, none reaching statistical significance. No significant heterogeneity was found by cancer type, region, exposure duration, industry, or study quality. No publication bias was detected (p=0.43). This analysis suggests a potential association between occupational benzene exposure and increased risk of female genital cancers, particularly in mortality data.

Enhancing practices related to infant and young child feeding (IYCF) is a suggested strategy to mitigate mortality risks and enhance nutritional conditions associated with wasting. Interventions centered on behavioral modifications through IYCF counseling hold promise in increasing the effectiveness of IYCF practices. In this review we sought to study the impact of intensive IYCF counseling interventions for preventing wasting and nutritional edema among infants and children up to 5 years of age. We searched 9 electronic databases for articles published up to July 2021, and conducted an updated search on Ovid MEDLINE and MEDLINE for articles published until April 13, 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. Two review authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Our outcomes included prevalence of wasting and underweight, deterioration to severe wasting, anthropometric outcomes (weight-for-height z-score, weight-for-age z-score) and child morbidity and mortality. We summarized the findings of this review for primary outcomes according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. A total of 10 studies from 17 records were found to be eligible for inclusion, and all of these studies were meta-analyzed. Evidence suggests that compared to controls, IYCF counseling is likely to have little to no impact on the prevalence of wasting (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.04; 10 studies; GRADE: moderate). Intensive IYCF counseling had little to no impact on WHZ, MUAC, or WAZ and had an uncertain impact on the prevalence of diarrhea, fever, cough, and underweight (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.97; 8 studies; GRADE: very low). Nutrition education and counseling showed uncertain GRADE evidence on reducing prevalence of underweight but had no association with wasting.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dyslipidemia can occur as a long-term side effect of childhood cancer treatment. The difference in prevalence among children receiving comparable treatment suggests a role for genetic variation. We conducted the first genome-wide association study on dyslipidemia in a large childhood cancer survivor cohort, using three additional cohorts for replication. METHODS Discovery analysis was performed in the Original Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort (N=4,332). Replication analyses were carried out in the CCSS Expansion cohort (N=2,212), the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE, N=2,829), and the DCCSS-LATER Cohort (N=1,814). In the CCSS cohorts, dyslipidemia was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 self-reported high cholesterol or high triglycerides, whereas in SJLIFE and DCCSS-LATER, it was assessed by serum lipid measurements. Association analysis was performed in the entire cohort and stratified by cancer treatment. RESULTS The initial discovery analysis yielded one genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8) and 16 suggestive (p<5x10-6) loci associated with dyslipidemia risk. Of these, one genome-wide significant and eight suggestive loci with biological plausibility were selected for replication analysis, but none replicated. Additionally, treatment-stratified analysis revealed six significant (p<5x10-8) loci, none of which replicated in meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Further research with clinically assessed data and larger sample sizes is needed to explore the genetic contributions to dyslipidemia risk in childhood cancer survivors. IMPACT The establishment of larger, internationally collaborative consortia of childhood cancer survivors is critical for generating more robust findings, which will help the identification of those survivors at risk for dyslipidemia and subsequently cardiovascular disease.",

To investigate potential contributors to pancreatic cancer risk among individuals without these exposures, we examined pancreatic cancer risk in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative who were never-smokers and non-drinkers. Methods The study included 40,205 women (aged 50-79 years at enrollment) who were never-smokers/non-drinkers at enrollment. Information on reproductive, health, and lifestyle factors was obtained at baseline. Diabetes was reported at baseline and during follow-up. Pancreatic cancer cases were centrally adjudicated. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Results Over an average follow-up of 16.6 years, 336 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were ascertained. High body mass index (HR≥35vs ≥18.5-<20kg/m2 1.42, 95%CI1.02-2.01), large height-adjusted waist circumference (HR≥88vs<80cm 1.51, 95%CI1.16-1.97), and diabetes (HR 1.53, 95%CI1.18-1.98) were associated with increased risk.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has significantly advanced the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients who develop resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. However, most patients inevitably develop resistance to the treatment, which presents a major challenge for long-term disease control. The molecular mechanisms underlying osimertinib resistance are complex and are generally categorized into EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent pathways. To address this issue, various therapeutic strategies have been explored. These include the development of fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs, novel targeted agents, and combination therapies involving molecular inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapeutic agents, and gene inhibitors. In addition, nanomaterials, particularly selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), have emerged as promising tools to overcome drug resistance. These nanomaterials can be used to enhance osimertinib delivery, improve its bioavailability, and modulate key resistance pathways at the cellular and molecular levels. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and highlights cutting-edge therapeutic approaches. Special attention is given to nanotechnology-based strategies, which offer new possibilities for personalized and precise treatment of NSCLC. A deeper insight into these molecular mechanisms is essential for improving the clinical efficacy of osimertinib and prolonging the survival of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

Yatein, a biogenic precursor of deoxypodophyllotoxin possesses antitumor effects. Herein, we explored its antitumor effect in breast cancer. Yatein significantly inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells by MTT, colony formation, EdU assay, and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, yatein suppressed the stemness of cancer cells, causing inhibition of migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanism study revealed that yatein inhibited TOP2A activity and stabilized TOP2A-DNA cleavage complexes, caused DNA damage and apoptosis, suggesting its potential in the treatment of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity and the complex immune microenvironment make it challenging to identify candidates for immunotherapy using dominant biomarkers. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells, particularly CD103+CD8+ tissue-resident T cells and their specific subsets, are generally linked to better outcomes in many cancers, but their role in renal cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that tumor-infiltrating CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+ tissue-resident T cells can serve as an unfavorable prognostic factor for ccRCC patients and may be related to PD-1 treatment outcomes. We assessed the infiltration of CD103+CD8+T, CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+T and other CD8+T cell subsets in ccRCC using multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and evaluated their links to patient clinicopathological features and prognosis. With published single-cell data from ccRCC patients treated with PD-1 therapy, we studied the expression differences of hnRNPA2B1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells between responders and nonresponders. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the infiltration levels of CD103+CD8+T, CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+T cells, and CD103+CD8+Bhlhe40+T cells in ccRCC tissues were all significantly higher (all P values were <0.01). Moreover, patients with a higher degree of infiltration of these cells had worse overall survival (HR = 0.3490, 95% CI: 0.09338 to 1.304, P = 0.0144). All of them can serve as independent prognostic factors for ccRCC patients (HR = 3.753, 95% CI: 1.317 to 10.693, P = 0.013). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells in patients responding to PD-1 antibody treatment had higher hnRNPA2B1 expression compared with nonresponders. In summary, our study indicates that tumor-infiltrating CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+ tissue-resident T cells can serve as predictive factors and indicators for unfavorable prognosis and patient responses to PD-1 treatment outcomes in ccRCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have gained interest as a tool for predicting drug transfer to human milk and assessing the exposure levels in infants. Our group previously developed an integrated lactation PBPK model framework to understand the transfer of drugs into milk and the resulting exposure in infants. As a part of the framework, the current paper focuses on performance of lactation PBPK models to predict maternal plasma and milk concentrations for drugs that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters-atenolol, escitalopram, and alprazolam. PBPK models for healthy adult subjects were developed for atenolol and escitalopram in Simcyp v23 and verified against clinical data. For alprazolam, the Simcyp library model was used. The built-in lactation compartment in Simcyp was utilized for the three drugs. Atenolol and escitalopram adult healthy PBPK models showed agreement of plasma concentration-time profiles with respective clinical data. The lactation PBPK models predicted milk concentration profiles with reasonable agreement for all three drugs as well. The predicted milk concentration-time profile, milk pharmacokinetic parameters and milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratio of atenolol, alprazolam, and escitalopram were within 2-fold of the reported values, suggesting agreement between simulation and clinical data. The current work shows the potential of lactation PBPK models to predict drug exposure in human milk for drugs that are not P-gp or BCRP substrates. The approach will be further evaluated for drugs that are substrates for these active transporters known to be present in mammary tissues.",

Pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis has been considered a promising therapeutic approach for various diseases. In this study, by integrating pseudonatural concepts with our newly developed rhodium-catalyzed C-H activation/Lossen rearrangement/oxa-Michael addition methodology, we rapidly assembled diverse benzofuro[2,3-<i>b</i>]pyridine PNP derivatives and systematically evaluated their antiferroptotic activity. Among these compounds, <b>4k</b> exhibited significant activity in suppressing ferroptosis.

Subsequent results demonstrated that <b>4k</b> effectively ameliorated ConA-induced acute liver injury. Collectively, our findings indicate that <b>4k</b>, featuring benzofuro[2,3-<i>b</i>]pyridine PNP scaffolds, acts as a selective inhibitor and could serve as a potential lead compound for further research.

This study is based on data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 to analyze trends in cancer deaths and predict future burdens. The burden of disease was assessed by aggregating age-standardized mortality rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Analyze the correlation between socio-demographic indices (SDIs) and gender and cancer incidence. Calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and its corresponding 95% uncertainty interval (UI) to summarize the overall trend. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict future trends. Cancer mortality from malignant tumors due to high metabolic risk has been trending upward each year over the past 30 years in middle SDI, low-middle SDI, and low SDI areas. The highest growth rates of increase were 51% in the low-middle SDI region, the AAPC values of 2.488 and 2.480 deaths and DALYs per 100,000 population, respectively. Cancer mortality rates in the medium-high SDI region decreased slightly after 2019. The ARIMA model predicts that mortality and DALYs will continue to rise steadily through 2050. The findings suggest the need for targeted health promotion outreach and clinical interventions supported by sustained medical inputs to more effectively manage the growing global cancer burden.",

    "abstract": "Chemokines are essential mediators of immune responses, and the CCL20/CCR6 chemokine signaling axis is known to be involved in inflammation, infectious diseases, and cancer progression. However, the role of the CCL20/CCR6 axis in host defense against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> osteomyelitis remains unknown. We hypothesized that the CCL20/CCR6 axis is critical for the recruitment and activation of immune cells against <i>S. aureus</i>, and the lack of CCL20 or its monogamous receptor CCR6 leads to exacerbation of <i>S. aureus</i> osteomyelitis. <i>In vitro</i> studies confirmed that osteoblasts and macrophages (M0 and M2 subtypes) secrete CCL20 following <i>S. aureus</i> exposure. Implant-associated osteomyelitis in C57BL/6, CCL20<sup>-/-</sup>, and CCR6<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed an early increase in planktonic bacterial growth on day 1 and increased bacterial loads in soft tissue and bone on day 14 post-infection in both CCL20<sup>-/-</sup> and CCR6<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed that CCL20<sup>-/-</sup> and CCR6<sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired recruitment of T cells, especially CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells, to the site of infection. Interestingly, CCR6<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited increases in osteoclast numbers, reactive bone formation, and reduced bone mineral density. In a clinical pilot study, we observed a fivefold increase in serum CCL20 levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in <i>S. aureus</i> osteomyelitis patients (<i>n</i> = 23) vs uninfected controls (<i>n</i> = 10). Remarkably, serum CCL20 levels immediately following septic death were 100-fold higher vs uninfected patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Collectively, these results highlight the critical role of CCL20/CCR6-mediated host immunity during the establishment of <i>S. aureus</i> osteomyelitis and the potential of CCL20 as a biomarker of osteomyelitis-induced sepsis. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is the most common pathogen in orthopedic infections, and hard-to-treat strains (methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>) cause >50% of these infections. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop immunotherapies to treat these life-threatening infections. The role of the CCL20/CCR6 chemokine signaling axis on <i>S. aureus</i> osteomyelitis is unknown. In our efforts to uncover its role, we reveal that osteoblasts and macrophages secrete CCL20 in response to infection, and mice lacking CCL20 or its monogamous receptor CCR6 are more susceptible to <i>S. aureus</i> osteomyelitis. Mechanistically, we observed that increased infection severity in the knockout mice is associated with decreased T cell recruitment and increased osteoclastogenesis at the bone infection site. Importantly, in a clinical pilot study, we observed that CCL20 can be a useful biomarker of osteomyelitis-induced septic death. Overall, our study highlights the crucial immunomodulatory role that the CCL20/CCR6 axis plays during osteomyelitis.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11), involved in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and autophagy, is overexpressed in breast cancer and correlates with poor clinical outcomes. However, its exact mechanisms remain largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that inhibiting CDK11 suppresses cell proliferation and migration and induces autophagy in breast cancer cells. The use of chloroquine (CQ) and ATG7 knockdown to block autophagy reversed the proliferation and migration inhibition caused by CDK11 reduction, indicating that induced autophagy suppresses breast cancer. Gene expression profiling revealed that CDK11 knockdown significantly downregulated the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2. Further studies showed that overexpression of BCL-2 partially reversed the autophagy and the inhibition of proliferation and migration induced by CDK11 knockdown. Additionally, a mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor model showed that BCL-2 overexpression partially rescued the tumor growth inhibition and reduction of LC3 expression induced by CDK11 knockdown. Taken together, these data reveal that inhibition of CDK11 induces autophagy and that CDK11 mediates autophagy to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, with BCL-2 playing an important regulatory role in this process. These findings highlight that CDK11 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast cancer.",

Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic data, including rapid urease test (RUT) results for <i>H. pylori</i>, were abstracted from consecutively entered patient medical records at the NRH.ResultsA total of 761 patients underwent upper endoscopy and RUT (2019-2022). Although RUT was positive in only 25.8% of patients (<i>N</i> = 196), relatively common findings of erosions (<i>N</i> = 90, 11.8%) and ulcers (<i>N</i> = 89, 11.7%), as well as frequently reported symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (<i>N</i> = 168, 22.1%), suggest a higher true prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i>-associated peptic ulcer disease in this cohort. Age was associated with an endoscopic finding of ulcers on univariate analysis. Multivariable modeling indicated a significant association between the presence of gastric erythema and erosions and the diagnosis of duodenitis. Multivariable regression also showed symptoms of melena and hematemesis to be significantly associated with the endoscopic finding of ulcers. Among patients treated for <i>H. pylori</i> who underwent follow-up endoscopy and RUT, 28.8% failed treatment.ConclusionThere was a high degree of concern regarding gastrointestinal symptomology and pathology in this cohort. Access to endoscopy and RUT in Solomon Islands remains limited to a single endoscopy unit.

We develop the concept of 'cartographic infrastructures' to reveal the hidden and fragile political, scientific, and social worlds that undergird the production of maps and the truths they bring into being. To illustrate this, we examine a series of highly influential maps published in the early 1960s by Denis Burkitt-a colonial doctor working in British East Africa-showing the geographical distribution of a pediatric tumour in Africa. By correlating the tumour with altitude and rainfall, the maps suggested it had a viral origin, a finding that profoundly affected cancer research and helped accelerate the development of viral oncology. Using reports, diaries, and photos left behind by Burkitt and others, we excavate the cartographic infrastructures that underpinned his maps and viral hypothesis. First, we examine how the research tradition of geographical pathology-with its focus on environmental factors in carcinogenesis and its interest in Africa as a laboratory for cancer research-provided Burkitt with the theories, networks, and funding necessary to conduct his work. Second, we examine the surveillance practices, ranging from tumour safaris to geographical plotting, that enabled Burkitt to generate and interpret the data underlying his maps. Third, we analyze the communities of white colonial medical officers and missionary doctors spread across Africa with their shared imaginaries of race, empire, and adventure on which Burkitt relied to conduct his surveys.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a prevalent complication of thoracic tumor radiotherapy, severely compromising treatment efficacy and the patients' quality of life, yet effective prevention or treatment strategies remain elusive. Folic acid (FA), a water-soluble vitamin, plays critical roles in DNA synthesis/repair, cell cycle regulation, epigenetic regulation via methylation, oxidative stress response, and embryonic development. However, its radioprotective role has not been systematically elucidated. This study aimed to investigate its effects and molecular mechanisms during RILI. The RILI murine model showed that folic acid supplementation significantly alleviated radiation-induced lung tissue damage, body weight loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Meanwhile, folic acid mitigated radiation-induced DNA damage and cellular senescence in lung tissues and lung epithelial cell lines. RNA sequencing identified a 29-gene SASP signature (including CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10), which was significantly suppressed by folic acid in irradiated lungs. Moreover, folic acid inhibited SASP production by suppressing the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. By integrating in vivo and in vitro models, we revealed that folic acid exerts its radioprotective effects by reducing cellular senescence and the production of SASP. Taken together, these findings indicated that folic acid is potentially a novel therapeutic strategy for RILI.",

For human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive previously treated AGC, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has emerged as the first molecular targeted therapy. Additionally, claudin-18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)-targeting antibody therapy has been established as a first-line treatment, with numerous ongoing clinical trials in later-line settings. Other promising molecular targets include trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 1(CAPRIN-1), and KRAS. Furthermore, innovative therapeutic approaches such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy are being developed. This review summarizes the historical and established evidence from clinical trials on previously treated AGC and discusses ongoing clinical trials and future perspectives in treatment development, with a focus on targeted therapies. Biomarker-driven treatment is expected to become the mainstream approach in the future.",

    "title": "Factors Influencing Hormone Remission in Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors With Residual Tumor: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Growth hormone-secreting pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (GH-secreting PitNETs) pose significant health risks due to hormone-related complications. Despite transsphenoidal surgical resection being the primary treatment, complete removal is often infeasible due to invasive growth patterns, leading to postoperative tumor residuals and uncertain hormone remission outcomes. This retrospective study included 458 patients with GH-secreting PitNETs who underwent surgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Data on preoperative hormone levels, MRI scans, and histopathological features were analyzed. Tumor segmentation, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) scores, and subcluster clustering based on MRI data were computed using radiomic features, while multivariate analyses determined factors influencing hormone remission. Single-cell data from four GH-type pituitary adenomas were collected from public databases to explore ITH in GH1 gene expression. Postoperative hormone remission was achieved in 61 of 144 patients (42.4%) with residual tumors. Univariate analysis demonstrated that in cases with tumor residuals, preoperative hormone levels, tumor resection rates, residual tumor volume, tumor residual location, residual-tumor proximity to the internal carotid artery, and MRI-based tumor heterogeneity were associated with hormone remission. Among these factors, preoperative hormone levels (10-30 ng/mL vs. ≤ 10 ng/mL: OR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.20-1.19, p = 0.115; > 30 ng/mL vs. ≤ 10 ng/mL: OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.36, p < 0.001), tumor resection rate (OR: 18.29, 95% CI: 2.08-160.97, p = 0.009), and tumor heterogeneity as measured by the ITH score (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.12, p = 0.042) were independent predictors of hormone remission in cases with residual tumors. Moreover, single-cell data showing highly variable GH1 expression within the same patient reveal ITH in hormone expression. Preoperative GH levels, tumor resection rates, and ITH scores independently predict hormone remission in GH-secreting PitNETs with residuals. This will provide intraoperative decision-making guidance on how to achieve the maximum possible hormone remission with residual tumors when complete tumor resection is not feasible.",

The gut microbiota is associated with patient outcome and toxicity from cancer therapy, although limited data are available for breast cancer. In the randomized phase 2b trial ICON, immunomodulating chemotherapy was investigated in combination with dual ICB in HR+ mBC. To determine whether gut microbiota could inform prognosis, we performed 16S (V3-V4) rRNA sequencing on fecal samples collected at baseline and after 8 weeks of study treatment. We showed that high alpha diversity before treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; primary trial endpoint) and overall survival. Alpha diversity was lower in patients with prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. However, alpha diversity remained significantly associated with PFS after correcting for prior chemotherapy and other factors in bivariate analyses. High-grade immune-related toxicity was also associated with high alpha diversity. These findings suggest that high alpha diversity should be further investigated as a positive prognostic factor in HR+ mBC and approaches to increase alpha diversity could potentially improve clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding the RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15 (FET proteins) are involved in chromosomal translocations in rare sarcomas. The encoded fusion oncoproteins typically include a DNA binding domain and function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting patients of all ages. Oncogenic fusion TFs are challenging to target directly and new therapies are needed. Treatment with the small molecule SP-2509 results in reversal of the transcriptional activity of the FET fusion that causes Ewing sarcoma, EWSR1::FLI1. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649), but its pharmacological activity in FET fusion positive sarcomas has not been demonstrated. We found potent seclidemstat cytotoxicity against both FET-rearranged and other fusion-positive sarcoma cell lines in vitro, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma. We also define transcriptomic effects of seclidemstat with bulk RNA-seq. Seclidemstat recapitulated much of SP-2509 transcriptional activity in Ewing sarcoma. Widespread transcriptional changes were seen in all tested cell lines after seclidemstat treatment, regardless of the fusion protein expressed. This included reversal of FET-fusion transcriptional signatures for EWSR1::WT1, EWSR1::ATF1, and EWSR1::ERG. Though novel inhibitors are unlikely to display single-agent efficacy in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged and other fusion positive sarcomas.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 antibody, have significantly changed the treatment landscape not only for unresectable melanoma but also for non-melanoma skin cancers. In addition, anti-PD-1 antibody administration methods have evolved and are now used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. As these treatment strategies have been evaluated, it has become clear that understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to the success of anti-PD-1 antibody-based immunotherapy. For example, racial differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy in melanoma are influenced not only by tumor-related factors such as tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, but also by components of the TME, including tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), all of which can affect the therapeutic outcome of ICIs. Furthermore, studies conducted during the development of neoadjuvant therapies have shown that tumor-reactive TILs are densely localized within primary tumors and are closely associated with both treatment efficacy and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic efficacy of currently available anti-PD-1 antibody-based immunotherapies for skin cancer and examine the role of the TME in influencing these therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Oral mucositis (OM) presents a common and debilitating side effect of chemotherapy for children and young people (CYP). Photobiomodulation is recommended for OM prevention in international guidance; however, the acceptability of photobiomodulation in paediatric cancer care is uncertain. This study explores this acceptability with CYP, their parents, and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Semi-structured interviews with CYP/parent dyads and focus groups with HCPs were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Framework analysis was completed utilising the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) using an initial deductive approach for theoretical rigour. Over-arching themes within and between constructs and participant groups were developed. Recruitment occurred alongside analysis until there was repetition of data and an absence of novel codes. Twenty-seven participants were interviewed. CYP were aged 8-15 years old; HCPs had diverse professional roles within paediatric oncology and dentistry. Over half of families and three quarters of HCPs had previous photobiomodulation experience. Data were coded for all seven TFA constructs. Four themes, consisting of multiple subthemes, were developed from 42 distinct codes: (i) positive attitudes towards photobiomodulation; (ii) importance of child-centredness and autonomy; (iii) lack of understanding of photobiomodulation treatment; (iv) perceived additional burden to healthcare teams. Photobiomodulation for OM prevention is acceptable to CYP, their parents, and HCPs during cancer treatment. Exploration of the theoretical facets of this acceptability supports adaptation of services to overcome highlighted challenges to photobiomodulation acceptance. Photobiomodulation services should be designed to reduce burden on healthcare services, with resources developed to support CYP's autonomy, comprehension and self-efficacy with intra-oral treatment.",

The resulting peptides, SPAM2 and SPAM3, have antibody-like affinities for hPD-L1 (dissociation constants between ~250 and 300 pM) and are selective for hPD-L1. Both SPAM2 and SPAM3 compete with hPD-L1 ligands known to interact with the programmed cell death protein 1 site and are stable in human serum. SPAM3 bound human glioma D423 cells with high affinity in flow cytometry experiments comparable to that of a clinical therapeutic antibody. These results support the use of affinity maturation selections to dramatically enhance the biophysical properties of linear, proteinogenic peptides for translational applications.",

This study compared immune responses to standard versus intensified pneumococcal vaccination strategies in IBD patients receiving anti-TNF (±immunosuppressors) or vedolizumab. In a prospective, multicenter, randomized open-label study across 7 French university hospitals, IBD patients in clinical remission on biologic therapy (anti-TNF ± immunosuppressors, or vedolizumab) were randomized 1:1 to an intensified (PCV13/PCV13/PPSV23) or standard (PCV13/PPSV23) regimen. Vaccine response (ELISA and opsonophagocytic assays [OPA]), side effects, and disease activity were monitored over 36 months. The primary endpoint was vaccine response at month 5 (M5), defined as antibody titers >1 µg/mL for at least 9 of 13 serotypes in ELISA. One hundred and four patients (median age, 43 years; 60.6% male; 68.3% Crohn's disease) were randomized to the standard (n = 51) or intensified (n = 53) regimen. At M5, the vaccine response was significantly higher in the intensified group compared to the standard group, as measured by ELISA (53.2% vs. 27.1%; relative risk [RR[ = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.15-3.36; P = .009) and OPA (90.9% vs. 62.5%; P = .007). OPA responses remained higher in the intensified group at M12, M18, and M36. Reduced responses were associated with anti-TNF therapy, combination therapy, and Crohn's disease. Both regimens were well tolerated, with no differences in safety profiles or IBD relapse rates. Intensified vaccination significantly enhances and sustains immune response over 36 months, particularly benefiting patients with CD on anti-TNF therapy.",

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice for canine intracranial gliomas. Recently, modern advanced radiation techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), have become widely available in veterinary medicine. However, the glioma-specific therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with modern RT remain unclear. This study aimed to describe survival outcomes and tumour response and to identify whether any treatment, clinical, and imaging factors were predictive of prognosis in dogs with intracranial gliomas treated with definitive-intent IMRT alone. Medical records of dogs with presumed intracranial gliomas that underwent definitive-intent IMRT were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-five dogs were included. Amongst them, 29 and 26 underwent fractionated RT (FRT) and stereotactic RT (SRT), respectively. In the 44 dogs that underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the overall measurable response rate was 77.3%. Clinical improvement was observed in 92% of the dogs. Local tumour regrowth and drop metastases were observed in 17 (30.9%) and 10 dogs (18.2%), respectively. The median overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 432, 670, and 441 days, respectively. Seven dogs (12.7%) died during RT or within 6 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival times between FRT and SRT. In the multivariate analysis, poor performance status, tumour location in the diencephalon, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery heterogeneity were significantly associated with shorter survival times. These findings suggest that definitive-intent RT results in tumour shrinkage and prolonged survival (432 days) with minimal radiation toxicity regardless of the RT protocol used. Performance status and MRI findings can be useful for predicting prognosis.",

However, optimizing mitochondria-targeted gene delivery to promote RGC regeneration and visual-photoreception recovery remains challenging in LHON. Here, mitochondria-targeted wireless charging gold nanoparticles (WCGs), doubling as a wireless charging-mediated gene-delivery platform and electric stimulus-restored phototransduction, are developed for LHON treatment. Upon high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) irradiation, WCGs enhanced MT-ND4 transfection efficiency, restored complex I activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in vitro, and further promoted RGC neurite outgrowth in LHON patient-derived iPSC-differentiated retinal organoids. Wireless charging combined with electric stimulation also facilitated in vivo gene delivery, effectively promoting neuronal recovery, preventing RGC degeneration, suppressing inflammation, and enhancing retinal electrophysiological function in the damaged retinas of LHON mice. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis revealed that HFMF-treatment reprograms Müller glia to enhance dendritic development, restore mitochondrial function, and express phototransduction genes to support photoreceptor function in vivo. Finally, functional retinal-optic-electrophysiological findings with spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level support that HFMF synergized with WCG/hND4 therapy, promoting retinal repairment with RGC neurite regeneration and recovering visual phototransduction in LHON mouse models.",

PFOA primarily targets the liver, inducing stress responses and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, while promoting hepatoma cell proliferation through the mTOR pathway. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of PFOA-induced liver cancer (LIHC), we will use a network toxicology approach that integrates multi-omics data to construct a compound-target-disease network, focusing on potential targets like ALDH1B1, which encodes the aldehyde dehydrogenase family in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism. It is hypothesized that hepatic metabolic homeostasis is disrupted and hepatocellular carcinogenesis is ultimately promoted by PFOA through direct binding to ALDH1B1 and interference with its function. To confirm this, we will employ molecular docking and dynamics simulations to validate the binding interactions and toxicity mechanisms at the molecular level. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of PFOA's hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity while identifying potential targets for risk assessment and intervention strategies related to environmental exposure.",

Based on the treatment received by the patients, they were divided into three groups: open surgery group (87 patients treated with conventional open excision surgery), rotary cutting group (65 patients treated with Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance), and ablation group (12 patients treated with microwave ablation). Subsequently, key indicators, including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, postoperative pain score, incidence of postoperative complications, and aesthetic outcome of the breast, were comprehensively compared and analyzed among the three groups.ResultsStatistical analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) among the groups in terms of operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, and postoperative pain scores at 24, 48, and 72 h. Specifically, the ablation group showed significantly lower values for these parameters compared with the rotary cutting and open surgery groups. The rotary cutting group exhibited better outcomes than the open surgery group across these metrics. In addition, the incidence of postoperative complications and aesthetic outcome of the breast in the ablation and rotary cutting groups were significantly better than those in the open surgery group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications and the aesthetic outcome of the breast between the ablation and rotary cutting groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionCompared with conventional open surgery, microwave ablation and Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance demonstrate superior surgical outcomes, lower postoperative pain levels, and reduced incidence of postoperative complications in the treatment of benign breast tumors. Microwave ablation offers shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, faster postoperative recovery, and significantly greater pain relief while providing better aesthetic outcome of the breast.",

Longitudinal design was employed to assess 230 patients. Changes in BTP, PGI, PPG and PPGR were measured. BTP intensity (mean, SD) before administration of a BTP medication (T0), 15 min after (T15) and 30 min after (T30) was 6.5 (1.63), 4.3 (1.5) and 2.3 (1.5), respectively. The mean PPG was 1.61 (SD 1.6). Almost all patients reported an improvement in PGI. There were no differences between the different opioids used as BTP medication, and PGGR and PGI (p = 0.728 and p = 0.442, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, higher pain intensity at T0 and lower pain intensity at T30 were independently related to PGI (p < 0.0005). The number of patients who achieved their goals increased at T30 (46.1%); 90.8% of patients reported an improvement in PGI; PPGR was correlated with PPG both at T15 and T30 (p < 0.0005) and was inversely correlated with pain intensity at T15' (p = 0.001) and T30' (p < 0.0005). PPG enables clinicians to individualise patient care and facilitates the assessment of pain response within the same patient over time, ensuring that the evaluation is both clinically relevant and meaningful. Together, the PPG, PGI and PPGR serve as important patient-centred metrics which support pain assessment and inform clinical decision-making in alignment with patients' expectations. Patient expectations, expressed as pain goals, are hard to be achieved. Nevertheless, global impression after a breakthrough medication is good, regardless the opioid used.",

The confirmed ORR was 27.8% (95% CI 9.7-53.5); four of five responders had complete responses (95% CI, 6.4-47.6). Median OS was 25.6 months (95% CI, 14.6-not evaluable); median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.4-14.6). The most common serious adverse reactions were dysphagia and tongue edema (each n = 2; 10.5%). ASP-1929 photoimmunotherapy plus pembrolizumab was generally tolerable, with promising efficacy in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a challenging disease to treat due to the limitations of conventional therapies, including toxicity to healthy cells and drug resistance. This underscores the need for alternative treatment modalities to target tumors more effectively while minimizing side effects. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as promising agents in the realm of cancer therapy, particularly through magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), which employs MNPs to generate localized heat in tumor tissues using an alternating magnetic field (AMF), while sparing healthy cells. This present study focused on the synthesis of self-regulating, temperature-controlled, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-coated manganese-zinc ferrite nanoparticle-based magnetic fluid (MF) to enhance the biocompatibility of MF and its therapeutic efficacy. The biocompatibility and cellular uptake of the synthesized MF were investigated by using the MTT assay and Prussian blue staining. Quantitative assessment of the internalization of MNPs was carried out using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The study further analyzed the immediate and 24 h delayed cytotoxic effects of MFH on breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and noncancerous murine fibroblasts (McCoy). The mode of cell death induced immediately and after 24 h post-MFH was examined using Hoechst/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Both MCF-7 and McCoy cells exhibited favorable biocompatibility and substantial internalization of MF, with a significant induction of apoptosis after MFH. A 24 h incubation period post-MFH enabled cells to transition from early- to late-stage apoptosis in both cell lines, resulting in nearly complete cell death. This research establishes a foundational framework for investigating the application of PAA-coated biocompatible MNPs, with the goal of further exploring their use in breast cancer spheroids and/or in vivo animal models to develop MFH-based cancer treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity, otherwise referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), is defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions and has been linked to an increased risk of depression in many parts of the world. Disadvantaged social identities potentially play an important role in shaping this association. However, these associations are poorly understood in situations of multiple disadvantaged social identities, especially among Black populations in the United States of America. This study examined the association between multimorbidity and depression severity among Black populations in the United States using the intersectionality approach. This study utilized IPUMS-NHIS datasets from 2009 to 2019. A weighted sample of 5,745 respondents aged 18 years and above was extracted from the data and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models. The study found that although multimorbid individuals had a higher risk of severe depression (RRR = 1.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95% CI:1.58-2.35), there are variations by individual's social identities. The risk was higher among Black Americans (RRR = 2.40; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95% C.I = 1.89-3.07) with MCCs compared to Black immigrants; and among females (RRR = 2.73; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.11-3.54) and unemployed (RRR = 2.69; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.07-3.51) compared to their male and employed counterparts, respectively. Those with multiple disadvantaged social identities yet had MCCs, especially, unemployed Black American females (RRR = 3.43; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.54-4.63) and males who were unemployed (RRR = 2.02; <i>p</i> < 0.05; 95% C.I = 1.42-2.87) had elevated risk of experiencing severe depression compared to those who had no MCCs and Black immigrants. The findings suggest the need to focus attention on the complex effects of multiple disadvantaged social identities in shaping mental health outcomes, particularly among individuals experiencing chronic health conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of fibrin glue application in reducing bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the general patient population. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 262 patients who underwent ESD for gastric neoplasms. The participants were randomized into the fibrin glue group (n=133) or the control group (n=129). The primary outcome was the post-ESD bleeding rate, which was compared between the two groups. Additionally, exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted for high-risk patients, which included patients taking antithrombotic agents (ATAs) and patients with resected specimens measuring 4 cm or greater. In the modified intention-to-treat population (n=252), the overall bleeding rate occurred in 10.7% of cases, including 10.3% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 11.1% of patients in the control group (p=0.839). In the per-protocol population (n=248), the bleeding rates were 10.3% in the fibrin glue group and 10.7% in the control group (p=1.000). Among ATA users, the overall bleeding rate was 18.0%, including 9.5% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 24.1% of patients in the control group (p=0.271). Among ATA users with specimens measuring 4 cm or larger, the overall bleeding rate was 18.4%, including 12.5% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 22.7% of patients in the control group (p=0.675). Routine application of fibrin glue after ESD did not significantly reduce postoperative bleeding. Although the results of subgroup analyses suggested a potential reduction in early bleeding among high-risk patients, these findings warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS-2) is a rare congenital immune dysfunction characterized by partial albinism and recurrent episodes of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It is caused by a variant in the gene encoding Rab27a leading to a degranulation defect in melanocytes, natural killer (NK)- and T cells. Prognosis of patients with GS-2 is limited by repetitive episodes of life-threatening HLH with onset in early childhood. The only curative treatment is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Here, we report on an 18 year old female patient with a homozygous missense p.Arg50Glnfs*35 variant in exon 2 of <i>RAB27A</i> who presented with an exceptionally late onset of severe HLH. Her phenotypically inapparent albinism complicated to correctly diagnose GS-2. Immune function assays confirmed a T- and NK cell degranulation deficiency characteristic for patients with primary HLH, while microscopic hair analysis revealed melanin clumps secondary to melanocyte functional impairment. To understand why disease onset occurred unusually late in this patient, we investigated the patient's T cell and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) function in more detail. We could show that intracellular granzyme B storage in cytotoxic T cells was increased compared to healthy donors and that the patient's T cells maintained some degranulation activity. Both, antigen-specific cytotoxic response and proliferation capacity of the patient's T cells were preserved. We demonstrate for the first time that also PMN degranulation, assessed as stimulation-induced CD66b and CD11b cell membrane expression, is dysfunctional in patients with Rab27a deficiency-associated primary HLH. The patient was treated with steroids and cyclosporine A for immunosuppression to control the HLH. After two severe episodes within only a few months, she eventually received an allogeneic HSCT and has not experienced further HLH episodes for now more than 3 years after the HSCT procedure. This case should raise awareness for the possibility of initial manifestation of primary, genetically-determined HLH even in adult patients.",

    "abstract": "Immunonutrition is a part of nutritional interventions in gastrointestinal cancer patients. It seems to be especially important in the preoperative period to reduce, among others, surgery-related complications. The relation between the immune system and gut microbiota has been previously analyzed. However, the influence of immunonutrients on the composition of gut microbiota is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of enteral immunonutrition on gut microbiota in gastric/colorectal cancer patients in the preoperative period. This study included 14 patients (<i>n</i> = 9 colorectal cancer, <i>n</i> = 5 gastric cancer) allocated to receive immunonutrition or standard products by 7 days prior to the surgery. Randomization was performed using a random number generator. The stool samples were collected at day 0 and after 7 days of consuming the study products. Therefore, gut microbiota analysis was conducted at the beginning and after 7 days (follow-up). The analysis consists of alpha diversity analysis, taxonomic data processing, beta diversity analysis, and differential abundance analysis. Statistical analysis did not indicate any significant differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05) between the two dietary groups for any of the alpha diversity indices. Microbial community compositions were largely similar between the immunodiet and standard nutridrink groups. Differential abundance analysis (DAA) using the Wilcoxon test identified several taxa with nominal <i>p</i>-values <0.05, suggesting potential differences in abundance between groups. However, none of these findings remained statistically significant. The taxa with nominal significance included <i>Bilophila</i>, <i>CAG-56</i>, <i>Clostridium sensu stricto 1</i>, <i>Coprobacter</i>, <i>Holdemania</i>, <i>Fusicatenibacter</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and [<i>Eubacterium</i>] <i>eligens</i> group. The analysis of gut microbiota in the context of immunonutrition is a new area in oncology. In the current study, despite some initial microbial alterations, it was not finally confirmed that immunonutrition has a beneficial effect on gut microbiota in gastric and colorectal cancer patients in the preoperative period. However, the small sample size is one of the study's limitations.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by pronounced invasiveness, rapid progression, frequent recurrence, and poor clinical prognosis. Current treatment strategies remain inadequate due to the lack of effective molecular targets, underscoring the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic avenues. In this study, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis and meta-analysis, incorporating clinical immunotherapy datasets, to identify ten candidate genes associated with GBM initiation, progression, prognosis, and response to immunotherapy. Multi-omics analyses across glioma and pan-cancer datasets revealed that these genes play pivotal roles in cancer biology. Phospholipase Cb4 (PLCB4) showed a negative correlation with tumor grade in clinical samples, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Evidence indicated that PLCB4 expression is modulated by Wnt signaling, and its overexpression may activate the calcium ion signaling pathway. Notably, <i>PLCB4</i> is strongly associated with aberrant tumor proliferation, making it a compelling therapeutic target. Through structure-based virtual screening, five small molecules with high predicted affinity for <i>PLCB4</i> were identified as potential drug candidates. This study's integrative approach-combining target identification, pathway inference, and in silico drug screening-offers a promising framework for rational drug development in GBM. The findings may reduce unnecessary experimental screening and medical costs, and represent a significant step toward improving therapeutic outcomes and prognosis for GBM patients.",

    "abstract": "RNA is a fundamental biological macromolecule that undergoes several post-transcriptional modifications, including adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). These essential enzymes catalyze the conversion of A-to-I in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, influencing RNA stability, splicing, and translation, all of which impact various cellular functions. More recently, RNA editing has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in cancer biology, where ADARs, primarily ADAR1 and ADAR2, exert context-dependent roles as either oncogenic drivers or tumor suppressors. Beyond their catalytic editing function, ADARs also regulate cancer-relevant pathways through editing-independent mechanisms, including RNA binding and protein-protein interactions. Dysregulated ADAR activity facilitates carcinogenesis by altering oncogene expression, impairing tumor suppressor pathways, and reprogramming the transcriptome to promote tumor progression. Furthermore, RNA editing may contribute to tumor cell immune evasion by affecting interferon signaling and altering neoantigen presentation, as well as modulating immune surveillance. Additionally, ADAR-mediated RNA modifications contribute to therapy resistance by modifying drug targets and pathways involved in cell survival and repair. This review comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted roles of RNA-editing ADAR enzymes in cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing editing-dependent and -independent mechanisms contributing to tumor progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Moreover, we highlight the potential of ADARs as prognostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets in oncology.

It remains unclear whether nivolumab is as effective for GSCC as it is for gastric adenocarcinoma. Herein, we present the case of a 66-year-old man diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus-positive metastatic GSCC, involving the liver, multiple lymph nodes, and invasion into the spleen, pancreatic body and tail, and splenic vein. The patient received nivolumab with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil plus local radiotherapy as first-line treatment; nivolumab, paclitaxel polymer micelles, and carboplatin as the second-line treatment, and nivolumab and apatinib as the third-line treatment. The patient responded remarkably (survival period for 49 months) with manageable treatment toxicity. Genomic and immune characteristics were analyzed to understand the underlying disease mechanisms. In conclusion, integrated therapy (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, and anti-angiogenic therapy) may be the ideal treatment approach for patients with GSCC with multiple metastases; however, prospective studies are needed to verify its efficacy.",

We evaluated whether ctDNA-directed stratification could optimize locoregional control in HNSCC patients following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. In this comparative cohort study, consecutive HNSCC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were stratified into two management groups: a ctDNA-guided cohort where tumor-informed ctDNA testing determined POCRT administration given only for detectable ctDNA, and a traditional cohort where all patients received PORT, with postoperative chemotherapy decisions made by multidisciplinary team review based on pathologic response status and pretreatment imaging findings. The primary endpoint was 3-year locoregional control, with secondary analysis of POCRT utilization rates. Among 257 patients who completed neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, 209 (81.3%) underwent surgery with 187 (72.8% of treated patients) achieving major pathological response and comprising our study population. Of these, 69 (36.9%) received ctDNA-guided management, while 118 (63.1%) followed traditional protocols. POCRT utilization was significantly lower in the ctDNA-guided group (27.5% [19/69] vs 42.4% [50/118]; absolute difference -14.9%, p=0.042). ctDNA positivity rates were comparable between groups (ctDNA-guided: 27.5% [19/69] vs traditional: 29.6% [35/118], p=0.867). ctDNA-guided management demonstrated superior outcomes, with a 15% reduction in locoregional recurrence risk (adjusted HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-0.94; p=0.013) versus traditional management. Among ctDNA-positive patients, POCRT benefit was significantly greater in the ctDNA-guided cohort (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.57-0.83; p=0.026) compared to ctDNA-positive patients receiving traditional management (HR 0.87, 95%CI 0.73-0.93; p=0.047; interaction p=0.039). Postoperative ctDNA analysis identifies HNSCC patients who benefit most from POCRT, enabling a 41% relative reduction in treatment utilization while maintaining superior locoregional control. The enhanced therapeutic effect observed in ctDNA-guided patients supports ctDNA's role as a decision-modifying biomarker for personalization management following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.",

Natural killer (NK) cells, a type of innate cytotoxic lymphocyte, possess unique antitumor properties that are independent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restrictions, making them promising candidates for \"off-the-shelf\" therapeutic products. NK cells can eliminate tumor cells through various mechanisms. Genetic engineering of NK cells can enhance their activation signals, promote proliferation, inhibit suppressive signals, and improve tumor homing, all of which are expected to significantly boost their clinical efficacy.

A cancer in which local treatment of liver metastases is particularly important is colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of brachytherapy of liver metastases of colorectal cancer. The analysis included 270 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated between 2015 and 2022. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to indications for treatment: patients with repeat oligoprogression, induced oligoprogression and induced oligopersistence. Patients were analysed in terms of PFS and OS depending on epidemiological factors such as age and gender and clinical factors such as tumour location, type of metastases, stage, LVSI, degree of malignancy, location of extrahepatic lesions, size of metastases, number of metastases, treatment intention and dose. The degree of response to treatment and its toxicity were assessed. During an average follow-up period of 16 months, the median PFS was 10 months and the OS was 17 months. 6m-, 12m-24m-PFS were 79%, 42% and 2%, respectively. and 6m-, 12m- and 24m-OS were 99%, 74% and 22%, respectively.

The most important factors that influenced the prognosis were the intention of treatment, the degree of response to treatment, the dose administered, the presence of extrahepatic metastases, and the degree of malignancy. The toxicity of the treatment was low, and the most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Brachytherapy is an effective and safe method of local treatment of liver metastases and should be considered especially in patients with a limited number of metastases who do not qualify for surgical treatment and the size of the metastases prevents the use of stereotactic radiotherapy.",

Traditional methods for predicting T cell epitopes primarily focus on MHC presentation, leveraging immunopeptidome data. Recent advancements however suggest significant performance improvements through transfer learning and refinement using epitope data. To further investigate this, we here develop an enhanced MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation predictor by integrating newly curated binding affinity and eluted ligand datasets, expanding MHC allele coverage, and incorporating novel input features related to the structural constraints of the MHC-I peptide-binding cleft. We next apply transfer learning using experimentally validated pathogen- and cancer-derived epitopes from public databases to refine our prediction method, ensuring comprehensive data partitioning to prevent performance overestimation. Integration of structural features results in improved predictive power and enhanced identification of peptide residues likely to interact with the MHC. However, our findings indicate that fine-tuning on epitope data only yields a minor accuracy boost. Moreover, the transferability between cancer and pathogen-derived epitopes is limited, suggesting distinct properties between these data types. In conclusion, while transfer learning can enhance T cell epitope prediction, the performance gains are modest and data type specific.

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Most cancers are treated through chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these methods have limitations due to cancer cells evading immune detection, prompting researchers to explore alternatives such as immunotherapy. Nonetheless, cancer cells can weaken the immune response, necessitating improvements in immunotherapy methods. Exosomes, tiny cell-derived nanoparticles, reflect the traits of their originating cells. Natural Killer NK cells produce exosomes comprising perforin, granzyme, Fas-L, etc. The small size, proximity to tumors, and stability of these exosomes enable easy absorption by cancer cells. This study demonstrates that IL-15 impacts NK-derived exosomes, enhancing their ability to kill cancer cells. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> With the addition of 100 nanograms per milliliter of IL-15 to NK-92 cell culture, the cells are incubated for 48 hours. Exosomes are then isolated from treated and non-treated NK-92 cell lines through the ultracentrifuge method. After isolation, different concentrations of exosomes from both groups are added to HL-60 cells for treatment. After 24 hours, the apoptosis rate is assessed through the Annexin-V method. <b>Results:</b> Increased light absorption in the BCA test, along with thicker bands of CD63 and CD81 in the Western blotting test, indicates a higher yield of exosomes after adding IL-15 to the source cells. The low p-value from the t-test demonstrates that exosomes derived from stimulated NK cells are more cytotoxic than those from the control group. Further, two-way ANOVA confirms differences between the control and treatment groups at each concentration, and Welch's t-test proves that all differences in the ANOVA test are significant. <b>Conclusion:</b> This article presents evidence that exosomes obtained from IL-15-induced NK cells not only increase in quantity but also demonstrate significant cytotoxicity against leukemic cells compared to exosomes obtained from non-stimulated NK cells.",

Forty-four patients (77.2%) returned to work in their previous or new roles. Among these, 27 (47.4%) worked full-time, 17 (29.8%) part-time, and 13 (22.8%) did not RTW. No significant relationship was found between RTW and factors such as age (p=0.116), gender (p=0.547), residence (p=0.333), insurance type (p=0.083), job type (p=0.526), history of chronic diseases (p=0.432), or cancer treatment method (p>0.999). However, significant correlations were observed between RTW and the quality of life questionnaire score (p=0.001), length of hospitalization (p=0.041), and annual income (p<0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Approximately 77% of colorectal cancer patients returned to work following treatment. Shorter hospital stays and higher income were associated with greater RTW rates. Additionally, the quality of working life questionnaire score was strongly correlated with RTW (p=0.001).",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat many cancers, and their sensitivity to radiation is crucial for favorable outcomes. This study investigated whether the immediate early response 5 (IER5) protein affects Cdc25B protein expression in HeLa cells after gamma irradiation. IER5 was knocked down using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells irradiated with 2 or 4 Gy of gamma rays. The mRNA and protein expression levels were subsequently determined via qRT-PCR and western blotting. The distribution of cells during the cell cycle was also determined using flow cytometry. IER5 protein levels were successfully reduced with RNAi. Variations in IER5 levels led to differences in Cdc25B mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, IER5 affected the proportion of cells in the G2 phase, which is regulated mainly by Cdc25B. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted on the expression levels of IER5 and Cdc25B in HeLa cells and the IER5-silenced HeLa (siIER5-HeLa) cell line at various time points after exposure to 4 Gy of gamma rays, and a negative correlation was detected between IER5 and Cdc25B expression levels, with correlation coefficients of -0.686 and -0.663, respectively. Additionally, variations in IER5 levels led to differences in the expression levels of p53, NF-YB, and p300, which may be putative transcriptional regulators of Cdc25B. These results suggest that IER5 plays a negative role in regulating Cdc25B expression, which may involve interactions with the transcriptional regulators p53, NF-YB, and p300.",

This study aimed to spotlight the risk factors, treatment modality and clinical outcomes over a 5-year period in our hospital. This retrospective study was done at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. All the patients with HCC diagnosed between 1st January 2019 and 31st December 2023 had their demographics, clinical information, and investigations collected. The outcome was overall survival, defined as time from diagnosis till death or lost to follow up. Data obtained was analyzed using SPSS version 20. A total of 138 patients were studied, 117 males (85%) and 21 females (15%). The median age was 46 years (IQR 14). Hepatitis B Virus infection was the main risk factor, found in 102 patients (73.9%). Among males, 35% took alcohol. Three patients (2.2%) with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A, 2 underwent surgical resection, while the other one had palliative care. Of six (4.3%) stage B patients, two had levantinib, one of which also had TACE and four had palliative care only. Ten of the sixty-three patients with stage C (45.7%) received chemotherapy, while all 64 (46.4%) in stage D received supportive care. Two (1.4%) unclassified patients received symptomatic treatment. Median survival times were 1.2 months for palliative care, 3 months for chemotherapy, and 18 months for resection (P < 0.005). Hepatitis B Virus was the main risk factor for HCC in our environment. Hepatic resection offered the best opportunity for survival.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma attributable to alcohol use (NPC-AU) contributes substantially to global cancer mortality and disability, yet its temporal and geographic patterns remain incompletely described. To assess the global, regional, and national burden of NPC-AU from 1990 to 2021 and project trends through 2040. Using GBD 2021 data, global, regional, and national age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life-years rates (ASDR) attributable to alcohol were evaluated. Trends were quantified by average annual percentage change (AAPC) and projections were generated using Bayesian age-period-cohort models. From 1990 to 2021, global ASMR declined from 0.31 to 0.19 per 100,000 population (AAPC -1.66; 95% CI -1.79 to -1.52) and ASDR fell with an AAPC of -1.72 (95% CI -1.87 to -1.57). Male ASMR decreased from 0.42 to 0.27 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.60), and female ASMR from 0.21 to 0.12 per 100,000 (AAPC -2.25). High-middle SDI regions saw ASMR drop from 0.50 to 0.28 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.97), whereas low-middle SDI regions experienced an increase from 0.09 to 0.11 per 100,000 (AAPC 0.72). Regionally, East Asia's ASMR declined at an AAPC of -2.70, Southern Latin America at -3.13, and Southeast Asia increased at 1.76. Age-specific peaks in ASMR shifted from 55-59 and 65-69 years in 1990 to 65-69 and 70-74 years in 2021. Projections forecast male ASMR of 0.35 per 100,000 (95% UI 0.03-0.67) and female ASMR of 0.02 per 100,000 (95% UI 0.00-0.04) by 2040. Although global ASMR and ASDR for NPC-AU declined markedly from 1990 to 2021, rising burdens in lower-SDI regions, persistent male predominance, and shifting peaks to older age groups highlight the need for targeted alcohol-control policies and age-tailored screening.",

For these optical tools to be clinically available, a multicenter trial is needed. We investigate if SHG-based prognostic signals vary with patient race, providing insight for designing such a trial. SHG imaging was performed on colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient samples to derive two prognostic indicators. We assessed the association between these indicators and patient race. SHG images were analyzed as previously described to determine the forward- to backward-SHG scattering ratio (F/B) and fiber angle variability (FAV). Both prognostic measurements were compared between Black and White patients. In the IDC cohort, F/B from the tumor-stroma interface differed significantly between demographic groups. For the CRC cohort, a trend was observed in the tumor-stroma interface and tumor bulk. FAV did not vary by race in either cohort. F/B variation with patient race suggests the relationship between F/B and metastatic outcome may vary with patient race. These findings highlight the potential need for race-specific prognostic algorithms to improve metastasis prediction for all patients.",

This study aims to address the challenges posed by tumors in reducing the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) through mechanisms such as hypoxia and abnormal blood vessel formations. In this study, manganese-containing DNA nanoflowers (DHA-DDF) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) were functionalized with an AS1411 aptamer and a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) antisense sequence. The in vitro tests confirmed their stability and pH-responsive drug release properties. The combined treatment of DHA-DDF and ultrasound could induce apoptosis, inhibit the migration and invasion of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, and down-regulate the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in LLC cells. The in vivo studies using subcutaneous LLC in mice showed that ultrasound enhanced the tumor-targeted accumulation and penetration of DHA-DDF. The combined approach markedly reduced tumor development and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, effectively down-regulated the expression of hypoxia-related genes, inhibited cell proliferation, and blocked tumor angiogenesis. The programmable, biocompatible, and multifunctional nanoflowers demonstrate a notable improvement in the efficacy of SDT and provide robust tumor inhibition in both cellular and animal models.

However, the conventional matrices derived from murine tumors, commonly used to generate PDX models, suffer from key limitations such as lack of tissue specificity, high production costs, and inconsistent batch quality. In response, our study investigates the use of decellularized liver extracellular matrix (Liver ECM) as a biomimetic alternative that more accurately recapitulates the native hepatic microenvironment. We demonstrate that Liver ECM, enriched with liver-specific biochemical cues, enables robust engraftment, growth, and metastasis of patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells in both subcutaneous and orthotopic PDX models. Notably, orthotopic models established with Liver ECM exhibited enhanced metastatic behavior, particularly to the intestine, compared to those formed using conventional matrices. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed activation of key pathways associated with cancer progression, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration, and inflammation. Additionally, we extend the application of Liver ECM to patient-derived organoid xenografts, which showed improved tumorigenicity and retained pathophysiological features of the original tumor tissue. Together, these findings underscore the potential of liver-specific ECM as a superior platform for generating physiologically relevant PDX models and enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical cancer studies.",

A 15-year-old South Asian male presented with right-sided upper abdominal pain persisting for 5 months. Imaging revealed a large, multiloculated cystic lesion involving the neck and body of the pancreas. Aspiration cytology and cyst fluid analysis (low carcinoembryonic antigen, elevated amylase, lymphocytes) were suggestive of pancreatic lymphangioma. The patient became asymptomatic and was managed conservatively with close monitoring. No surgical intervention was performed. This case demonstrates that conservative management of pancreatic lymphangiomas may be appropriate in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adolescents with benign imaging and biochemical features.

In this study, the TCGA database combined with Microarray was used to detect differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in GC tissues and cells. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR was used to further verify the expression of miR-145-5p in GC cells and the 41 pairs of GC tissues and adjacent tissues. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the correlation between miR-145-5p and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GC. The proliferation ability and cell cycle of AGS and MKN28 were detected by CCK-8, Edu and flow cytometry. The downstream target genes of miR-145-5p were screened by bioinformatics and further verified by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of SMAD5 in GC tissues. Western blot was used to detect cell cycle-related proteins that were regulated by siRNA SMAD5. The expression of miR-145-5p was lower in GC tissues and cells compared with adjacent tissues and GES-1, and was related to the poor prognosis of patients with GC. Overexpression of miR-145-5p inhibited the proliferation of GC cells and blocked the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase. MiR-145-5p targeted SMAD5 to inhibit the proliferation, and arrested the G1/S phase transition of GC cells. Mechanistically, SMAD5 siRNA significantly reduced CCND1 protein expression, Bioinformatics databases predicted that cyclin D1 was the transcription target gene of SMAD5. Moreover, the re-expression of cyclin D1 partially reversed the cell cycle arrest that was induced by SMAD5 depletion in GC cells. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel role of the miR-145-5p/SMAD5/cyclin D1 axis in modulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in GC, which may provide a prognostic biomarker for GC treatment.",

The new class of medicines based on RNAi combines the process of diagnosis and treatment via sequence-specific recognition of biomarker mRNAs and downregulation of their translation. While this approach proved clinically successful, safer, and more personalized options that mitigate adverse effects can be revealed by separating diagnostic and treatment steps.

RecNANPs are non-immunostimulatory, achieve prolonged gene silencing compared to conventional RNAi inducers, and can be combined with chemotherapy.

The Industrial Revolution, advancing technology and society, led to elevated air pollution levels, contributing to acid rain, smog, ozone depletion, and global warming. Poor air quality increases risks of respiratory inflammation, tuberculosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumoconiosis, and lung cancer. In this context, developing reliable air pollution forecasting models is imperative for guiding effective mitigation strategies and policy interventions. This study presents a daily air pollution prediction model focusing on Jakarta's sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO) levels, leveraging a hybrid methodology that integrates Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) with the Fuzzy Time Series Markov Chain (FTSMC) approach. The analysis revealed five distinct clusters, with medoid selection refined iteratively to ensure stabilization. A 5 × 5 Markov transition probability matrix was subsequently constructed for modeling the data. Predicted values for SO₂ and CO in Jakarta using the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method showed strong alignment with the actual data. Forecasting accuracy results for SO₂ and CO in Jakarta, based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), showed excellent performance, underscoring the efficacy of the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid approach in predicting air pollution levels.•The CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method demonstrates high effectiveness in analyzing large datasets, addressing the limitations of previous hybrid clustering fuzzy time series methods.•The number of fuzzy time series partitions is optimally determined based on clustering results obtained through the gap statistic approach, ensuring robust partitioning.•The forecasting accuracy of the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method, evaluated using MAE and RMSE, showed excellent performance in predicting daily air pollution levels of SO₂ and CO in Jakarta.",

More recently, the pig-to-human brain-dead decedent model was introduced with claims that this might replace (or at least augment) the pig-to-NHP model. There are, however, several limitations of the decedent model, most notably the very limited period during which the subject may remain sufficiently metabolically and hemodynamically stable to allow meaningful monitoring of the fate of a pig organ graft. It will be exceedingly difficult to provide the regulatory authorities with data from experiments in which truly prolonged graft function has been monitored, whereas this is already being achieved in the pig-to-NHP model. In view of the complications related to the effects of brain death, the data obtained from xenotransplantation experiments in decedents may provide confusing results. There is a real risk that this may influence the regulatory authorities to become overly cautious in approving formal clinical trials of pig organ xenotransplantation to be initiated.

The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the feasibility of establishing a molecular diagnosis in accordance with the WHO 2021 diagnostic criteria for CNS tumors. 23 cases with unspecified histopathological diagnosis were identified, 16 cases were assigned to group 1, seven cases to group 2. DNA-methylation-based profiling and copy number variations enabled a tumor diagnosis in nine (56.3 %) cases in group 1 and three (42.9 %) cases in group 2, adding up to 12 tumors (52.2 %). Five cases were identified as physiological cortex. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating DNA methylation-based profiling into diagnostic workflows, contributing to an accurate diagnosis in challenging cases.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a pediatric brain cancer that has a dismal prognosis with limited treatment options. We present the treatment course and outcome of an adolescent male diagnosed with a thalamic DMG carrying a histone H3.3 K27M (H3K27M) alteration. Tumor biopsies were taken at diagnosis for histological analysis, molecular profiling, and <i>ex vivo</i> drug sensitivity testing (DST). Seven months after diagnosis, the patient had recurrent/progressive disease after radiotherapy and an ineffective molecular-guided therapy based on tumor molecular profiling. The patient then started a novel functional precision medicine (FPM)-guided two-drug combination of disulfiram, based on the DST results of this drug on the patient's tumor cells obtained at diagnosis, and ONC 201, the only drug that has advanced to a phase III clinical trial for H3K27M-DMG. Neuroimaging demonstrated a treatment response, and the patient lived for fifteen months after starting this personalized therapy. Disulfiram was discontinued after three months due to significant peripheral neuropathy. Our case describes the feasibility and limitations of using DST of patient-derived tumor cells to identify potentially effective personalized and novel therapies for DMG, which should be evaluated for efficacy and safety in formal N-of-1 clinical trials settings. We discuss the benefits and risks of this approach, particularly considering its use in children, adolescents, and young adults with pediatric brain cancers.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and immune-mediated safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain controversial. Given TNBC's aggressive biology and poor prognosis, definitive evidence is urgently needed. We performed this meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the benefits and safety of these inhibitors by examining clinical trial data for TNBC. Up until October 25, 2024, a thorough search was done in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to find research assessing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in treating TNBC. This study ultimately included 8 randomized controlled trials involving 5,512 patients. Pathological complete response (pCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were among the primary objectives, which defined as adverse drug reactions affecting various organ systems due to immune system activation, were graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria. The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased pCR rates by 77% compared to chemotherapy alone (OR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.28-2.45, P<0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the benefit of pCR was more evident in patients with lymph node positivity(OR=2.57,95% CI:1.76-3.75, P < 0.01). For EFS, the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) combination therapy decreased the possibility of events by 35% (HR=0.65,95%CI:0.54-0.80, P< 0.01), with notable benefits observed in earlier-stage (T1-T2) patients(HR= 0.53, 95%CI:0.40-0.70, P < 0.01). Similarly, PFS was improved in the experimental group for both ITT (HR=0.79,95% CI, 0.71-0.88, P<0.01) and PD-L1 positive populations (HR=0.71,95%CI:0.63-0.81, P < 0.01). However, the incidence of irAEs was significantly higher in the ICIs group compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (OR=2.77,95% CI:1.93-3.96, P < 0.01). With lymph node status acting as a crucial predictor, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and neoadjuvant chemotherapy dramatically improves pCR and EFS in TNBC. Additionally, it improves OS and PFS, although at the cost of an increased incidence of irAEs. These findings offer insightful information for upcoming clinical trial designs, economic evaluations, and clinical decision-making in TNBC treatment. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42025640551.",

A total of 57 ESCC patients who underwent dual-phase DECT scans were included. Key parameters measured were iodine concentration (IC), water concentration (WC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), spectral Hounsfield unit curve slope (λHu), and effective atomic number (Zeff). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with Ki-67 expression levels. Results showed that high Ki-67 expression correlated with significantly higher Zeff and IC values in the venous phase (VP) (P = 0.047 and P = 0.049, respectively; AUC = 0.67 for both), and lower WC in the arterial phase (AP) (P = 0.021; AUC = 0.70). Multivariate analysis revealed that IC in VP and WC in AP were independent predictors of Ki-67 overexpression. The combination of these two parameters yielded an AUC of 0.78 for predicting Ki-67 overexpression, with 68.3% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, and 73.7% accuracy. DECT parameters demonstrate potential for non-invasive Ki-67 status detection in ESCC, offering valuable insights for clinical diagnosis and prognosis.",

A 76-year-old male patient underwent laparoscopic radical resection for rectal cancer, accompanied by ileostomy, at our institution. Postoperatively, the patient received two cycles of XELOX chemotherapy but continued with oral capecitabine for six cycles due to oxaliplatin intolerance. Follow-up enhanced CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed an isolated metastatic tumor in the spleen. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. Histopathological examination post-surgery confirmed the metastasis of rectal cancer to the spleen.

However, insufficient medical and financial resources have been reported to hinder program implementation; therefore, enhancing program efficiency is crucial. Although demographic factors have been reported to correlate with public health program efficiency, it remains unclear whether this applies to cancer screening. To evaluate the efficiency of cancer screening programs conducted in Japanese municipalities and analyze their relationship with demographic characteristics, including population size and aging rates. A cross-sectional study using national open-source data from 2019. We collected data from all 1741 Japanese municipalities in 2019 using a national open-source database. After applying inclusion criteria, 1593 municipalities were analyzed. Program efficiency was measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), with inputs including the number of public health nurses, medical institutions, and healthcare expenditure per target population. Outputs were cancer screening participation rates. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between efficiency, population size, aging rates, and their interaction. Of the 1593 municipalities analyzed, 414 (26.0%) were deemed efficient. A statistically significant interaction between aging rates and population size was observed in the model predicting screening efficiency. In municipalities with aging rates above 31.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.2-37.1), larger target populations were associated with lower efficiency. Conversely, in municipalities with over 1075 screening targets (95% CI: 552-1381), higher aging rates were linked to lower efficiency. This study suggests that aging rates and population size may be associated with municipal-level differences in the efficiency of cancer screening programs. Understanding the mechanism underlying this relationship could help inform resource allocation and program design. Further research is warranted to explore these relationships more deeply and to support the development of more efficient screening strategies, particularly in the context of ongoing demographic shifts.",

Assessing how this performance varies with these factors is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of biomarkers and to identify areas for improvement in sub-populations with poor performance. Additionally, the presence of competing risks complicates the assessment of discriminative performance. Ignoring competing risks can lead to misleading conclusions, as the biomarker's performance for the event of interest, such as disease onset, may be confounded by its performance for competing events, such as death. To address these challenges, we develop a regression model to assess the impact of covariates on the discriminative performance of biomarkers, characterized by the covariate-specific time-dependent Area-undercurve (AUC) for a specific cause. We construct a pseudo partial-likelihood for estimation and inference and establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the finite sample performance of these estimators, and we apply the proposed method to data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK).",

Moreover, cell toxicity in DDP-treated RAW 264.7 cells was suppressed by CSP. In a mouse model generated on LLC1 tumor-bearing mice, CSP and DDP combination treatment significantly increased DDP-induced tumor cell death.

Although numerous computational predictors exist for predicting AIP samples, most rely on traditional compositional features that fail to capture internal sequence ordering, local structural variations, and evolutionary information to determine peptide functionality. To address these problems, we propose DeepAIPs-SFLA, a novel deep learning-based computational model that integrates evolutionary information and structural features using advanced image-based encoding. The training sequences were transformed into two-dimensional structural and evolutionary images using RECM and PSSM embeddings. These images were further decomposed using LBP and CLBP algorithms, resulting in novel local texture descriptors: RECM_CLBP, PSSM_CLBP, and RECM_LBP. A differential evolution-based feature integration method was employed to construct a comprehensive multiview feature vector. Subsequently, an enhanced genetic algorithm-based shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) was applied for optimal feature selection. An optimal feature set was used to train a deep residual convolutional neural network (RCNN). Our developed DeepAIPs-SFLA model attained an outstanding predictive accuracy of 97.04% with an AUC of 0.98 using the training sequences. The model was validated via independent sets to examine its generalization power, demonstrating substantial enhancements of 13 and 2% in accuracy compared with available predictors on the Ind-426 and Ind-1049 data sets, respectively. The robustness and efficacy of DeepAIPs-SFLA represent its potential as a valuable model for advancing academic research and drug discovery for inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nanomaterials hold significant promise in targeted cancer therapy due to their unique physicochemical properties and functional versatility. Among these, metal-phosphate-organic frameworks (MPOFs) have emerged as particularly attractive candidates for drug delivery applications. In this study, copper-(II)- and strontium-(II)-based MPOFs were synthesized and loaded with l-arginine, doxorubicin (DOX), or both, and their cytotoxic effects were evaluated against MCF-7 and A549 cancer cell lines. The synthesized nanomaterials included l-Arg@Cu-(II)-MPOF, DOX/l-Arg@Cu-(II)-MPOF, DOX@Cu-(II)-MPOF, l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOF, DOX/l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOF, and DOX@Sr-(II)-MPOF. The synthesis was performed at different pH values (5, 7.4, 9, and 11). The Cu-(II)-based MPOFs were successfully synthesized at pH 5, 7.4, and 9, while the Sr-(II)-based MPOFs could be obtained only at pH 11. The FT-IR and X-ray diffraction spectra of the synthesized MPOFs were used to characterize their structural and chemical compositions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), EDX, and elemental mapping analyses were also used to identify the surface morphology and elemental makeup. The surface morphology of the Cu-(II)-MPOFs, as shown by the FESEM images, had a well-defined crystalline porous nanoflower architecture with a size between 6.3 and 18.1 μm. Interestingly, the l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOFs also developed a stacked porous flower-like architecture, but the inclusion of DOX interfered with this architecture such that the nanosheet-like architecture was formed. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized MPOFs was determined by MTT assays in MCF-7 and A549 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 4.19 to 22.83 μg/mL. The highest cytotoxic activity was shown by MPOFs with DOX as the only ligand in both cell lines. Also, the DOX@Cu-(II)-MPOF prepared at pH 9 revealed maximum anticancer activity, with an IC50 of 4.73 μg/mL against MCF-7 and 4.19 μg/mL against A549 cells. Sr-(II)-based MPOFs proved to be more cytotoxic toward the A549 cell line. Specifically, the DOX@Sr-(II)-MPOF proved to be most active, with an IC50 of 5.51 μg/mL against A549 cells. These results identify the promising cytotoxicity of the prepared MPOFs and introduce their prospects as new targeted cancer therapy platforms.",

    "abstract": "Prostatic urethral obstruction (PUO) is the urethral narrowing by the external pressure of an enlarged prostate, which hinders the ability to pass urine normally. The most common reasons for an enlarged prostate are prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. In this study, we aimed to develop a drug-loaded shape-memory polymer urethral stent (SMPUS) to address PUO. The SMPUS was designed to combine both mechanical and chemical/herbal treatment of PUO. Successfully, SMPUS shows potential mechanical efficacy through its shape-memory properties that ensure the patency of the urethral lumen by restoring its tube-like stent shape upon flushing with hot water at its melting temperature. Additionally, the in vitro drug release investigation shows the capability of SMPUS to serve as a versatile drug delivery platform, after further in vivo investigation, enabling the release of the selected drugs to treat the primary diseases associated with PUO while mitigating the systemic side effects associated with conventional treatments. Both polymer and drug concentrations can be modulated to achieve the required mechanical and thermal properties based on the case progress. This adaptability of the developed SMPUS allows for future in vivo and clinical trials in medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the common malignant tumors among women, and in recent years, the role of gut microbiota in tumorigenesis has been increasingly gaining attention.Existing research has shown that the gut microbiome, establishes axis connections with multiple extra-intestinal organs. However, whether gut microbes affect the process of endometrial carcinogenesis through metabolic pathways and the specific mechanisms by which they promote the development of EC remain unclear. This study aims to explore the impact of overweight-mediated gut microbiota on the initiation or progression of EC and to assess its relationship with metabolites, thereby providing new insights for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we analyzed gut microbiota differences among normal-weight, overweight EC patients, and healthy controls using 16S rRNA sequencing. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and KEGG analysis identified group-specific metabolites and pathways, while Spearman correlation analysis revealed associations between microbiota and metabolites. This study revealed that in the ECMO group, the genus Megamonas exhibited the highest abundance and significant intergroup differences (H=13.46, P<0.05). Additionally, the <i>Bacillota/Bacteroidota</i> ratio (B/B ratio) gradually increased in the CN, ECMN, ECMO group. LEfSe analysis identified <i>Megamonas</i> and Amedibacillus as potential biomarkers for the ECMO group. Serum metabolomics of overweight EC patients highlighted lipid metabolism-related metabolites with the most specific expression. KEGG enrichment analysis of differential metabolites highlighted that the Glycerophospholipid metabolism and Purine metabolism pathways were notably significant in both the ECMN and ECMO groups. The study found significantly elevated abundance of <i>Megamonas</i> in the gut microbiota of overweight EC patients, which may promote EC progression by degrading inositol to enhance lipid absorption. This reveals the role of gut microbiota in EC pathogenesis through lipid metabolism regulation, providing a theoretical basis for microbiota-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

Collagen-based materials, employed as dermal fillers to smooth wrinkles, have attained extensive utilization. Nevertheless, traditional animal-derived collagen protein primarily presents concerns pertaining to disease risks, potential immunological reactions, and batch instability. Here, we introduced a highly durable 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether cross-linked recombinant human collagen type III (rhCol III) microgel as dermal filler for rejuvenating aging skin. The rhCol III microgel exhibited exceptional thermostability, mechanical strength and injectability. Subsequently, we established a UV-photoaging skin animal model and chose rhCol III microgel as a bioactive material for <i>in vivo</i> implantation, systematically comparing its biological effect with commercialized collagen I (Col I) derived from porcine skin (pCollagen) and hyaluronic acid through histological observation, immunofluorescence staining, hydroxyproline quantification and analysis of specific gene expression. Outcomes indicated rhCol III microgel prompted augmented production of Col I, collagen III (Col III) and elastic fibers, thereby contributing to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In summary, our investigation contributed to robust biosafety and rejuvenation of UV-induced skin photoaging by rhCol III under a single injection for 6 weeks. Despite the imperative ongoing efforts required for the successful translation from bench to clinic, the discernibly superior safety and efficacy of rhCol III microgel present an innovative methodology in combating skin aging, offering significant promise in medical cosmetology and tissue engineering.",

This exploratory study proposes a machine learning approach integrating radiomic features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans to improve classification accuracy for glioblastomas (GBM), meningiomas, brain metastases, and normal controls (NC). A total of 154 patients (74 GBM, 62 meningioma, 18 brain metastases) and 170 NCs were included in the study. MRI scans underwent standard preprocessing. To address class imbalance, data augmentation was applied to the GBM, meningioma, and brain metastases groups, increasing their sample sizes to 148, 124, and 180 cases, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analysis and Curvelet-based transformations. Feature selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multicollinearity assessment using the Spearman correlation test. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed. Nine machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and LightGBM, were trained and evaluated. Random Forest and CatBoost achieved the highest performance, with 95.2% accuracy using LASSO-selected features, outperforming other classifiers. Combining GLCM and Curvelet features improved accuracy over either set alone. PCA-based dimensionality reduction (99% variance) also performed well, but slightly below LASSO. Integrating Curvelet and GLCM-based radiomics with optimized models improves diagnostic accuracy, offering a promising tool to assist radiologists in tumor classification.",

This disease is known to have a poor prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence compared to conventional gastric adenocarcinoma. At the age of 44, a 60-year-old female underwent a laparoscopic-assisted proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer at a previous hospital. Neuroendocrine carcinoma was diagnosed following a postoperative pathological examination based on histological findings and immunostaining results. The patient was followed up without any recurrences. After 14 years, a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT revealed a 9-mm mass on the greater curvature side of the gastric antrum, which was suspected to be lymph node swelling at the previous hospital. After 8 months, she came to our hospital with abdominal discomfort and distention. The CT scan revealed a 55-mm mass, indicating an increase in the previously mentioned mass. At our hospital, the patient underwent open tumor resection. The pathological findings revealed a recurrence of gastric NEC. The patient has been recurrence-free for 6 months following surgery. We present a case of gastric NEC with disseminated recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a disseminated case in which a recurrent lesion caused by omental dissemination grew in size and infiltrated a portion of the gastric serosa approximately 14 years after the initial surgery.",

No local recurrence or distant metastasis was observed during the first 3-year follow-up period after treatment. Three years later, she presented to the emergency department with muscle weakness. A 60-mm lesion in the right parieto-occipital lobe of the brain and a 40-mm tumor in the small bowel mesentery were detected. Emergency craniotomy confirmed a cerebral metastasis of the Ewing sarcoma. The patient subsequently underwent 6 cycles of ifosfamide (IFM) monotherapy, which reduced the mesenteric tumor to 10 mm in size. Surgical resection was performed with clear margins. Histopathological examination of the mesenteric lymph nodes confirmed the findings of the emergency craniotomy. The patient continues to receive IFM monotherapy as adjuvant chemotherapy. Although brain metastases developed at postoperative months 1, 6, and 10, no intra-abdominal recurrence was observed during the 1-year surveillance period.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel treatment approaches. This study examined how mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes containing extraction of <i>Grifola frondosa</i> (<i>G. frondosa</i>) affected lung cancer cells. Exosomes were obtained from mesenchymal stem cells and loaded with <i>G. frondosa</i> extract (extract-exosomes) by sonication. The effects of extract-exosomes on A549 lung cancer cells were assessed in vitro on cell viability, colony formation, mitochondrial membrane disruption, migration, apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle. Moreover, we examined apoptosis-related genes mRNA expression by real-time PCR. Finally, both NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were evaluated by western blotting method. Our results indicated that exposure to extract-exosomes significantly inhibits lung cancer cells proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Furthermore, this treatment increased mitochondrial membrane disruption, apoptosis, and autophagy in the cancer cells. Additionally, there was a notable increase in the number of the treated cancer cells at G1 and sub-G1 phases of the cell cycle. The research findings indicate that extract-exosomes can inhibit lung cancer cells proliferation through the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, cell cycle arrest, as well as modification of NF-κB and MAPK pathways.",

This case report describes the first instance of penile porokeratosis from Nepal, highlighting its rarity and clinical presentation. A 22-year-old male presented with a 3 × 3 cm annular plaque on the shaft of his penis, which had been asymptomatic for a year. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of porokeratosis, and tests for sexually transmitted infections were negative. Following a single session of cryotherapy, the patient was counseled about the benign nature of the lesion. Regular follow-ups were scheduled every 4 weeks for additional cryotherapy and to monitor for any potential malignant change. GP is a rare condition, potentially triggered by environmental factors like heat and friction. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its similarity to other dermatoses, making histopathology essential. Although other forms of porokeratosis carry a risk of malignancy, there are no known cases of GP progressing to cancer. Penile porokeratosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent genital lesions. A biopsy is crucial for accurate diagnosis, as misdiagnosis can delay appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to better understand this rare disease, including its incidence, pathophysiology, and risk of malignant transformation.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer between females globally with many involving risk factors. There are increasing evidences about the role of obesity, which is usually assessed using body mass index (BMI), and hypercholesterolemia in breast cancer development through different mechanisms including the interplay with the immune response. The histopathological grading, which reflects the degree of differentiation, could be used to determine the aggressiveness of breast cancer. Limited studies assessed the correlation between the previous factors and histopathological grading in breast cancer patients and they concluded controversial results. We aimed to investigate the correlation of BMI and total cholesterol levels with histopathological grading in breast cancer patients with regard to menopausal status. Total cholesterol was measured using Qimica kit/Spain and data were analyzed using suitable statistical tests. <i>P</i>-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. We found a significant relationship between BMI and tumor grading (<i>P</i> = 0.008). The correlation was observed in postmenopausal patients (<i>P</i> = 0.01) with no correlation in premenopausal patients (<i>P</i> = 0.32). Also, there was a significant correlation between total cholesterol and tumor grading (<i>P</i> = 0.003) only in postmenopausal patients (<i>P</i> = 0.011) with no correlation in premenopausal patients (<i>P</i> = 0.32). There is a significant relationship of histopathological grading with both BMI and total cholesterol levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Further studies with larger samples are needed to evaluate the role of those factors in breast cancer progression and aggressiveness and their effects on immunotherapy tolerance and response.",

    "title": "Hypoxia-driven angiogenesis in breast cancer mechanisms and therapeutic targets: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with hypoxia playing a crucial role in its progression. Hypoxia, defined as reduced oxygen availability, is a hallmark of solid tumors and particularly influences the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. Under hypoxic conditions, tumors activate a variety of molecular responses that promote survival, including the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). These transcription factors regulate the expression of pro-angiogenic genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which drive angiogenesis and support tumor growth. However, the vasculature formed under hypoxic conditions is often dysfunctional, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. This review explores the mechanisms by which hypoxia drives angiogenesis in breast cancer, emphasizing the roles of HIFs, VEGF signaling, and metabolic reprogramming. Angiogenesis, a critical process for tumor survival and growth, is primarily mediated by the induction of VEGF under hypoxic conditions. VEGF acts on endothelial cells to promote blood vessel formation, ensuring the tumor receives sufficient oxygen and nutrients. However, the vessels formed are typically leaky and inefficient, exacerbating the hypoxic environment and perpetuating a cycle of tumor progression. The metabolic reprogramming that occurs in hypoxic tumor cells, such as the shift toward glycolysis (the Warburg effect), also plays a pivotal role in sustaining angiogenesis. The resulting acidic conditions further enhance VEGF production and endothelial cell migration, supporting continued tumor growth and metastasis.",

Due to its nonspecific symptoms, it is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays in appropriate management. We report a case of a 45-year-old female who presented with post-micturition palpitations, diaphoresis, hypertensive episodes, and chronic lacunar infarcts for several years. Initially misdiagnosed with an anxiety disorder and later migraine with generalized anxiety disorder, her symptoms persisted despite psychiatric and neurological treatments. Further evaluation with ultrasonography and CT-intravenous urography revealed a bladder mass, prompting surgical intervention. Histopathology confirmed bladder paraganglioma with classic Zellballen architecture, and immunohistochemistry showed positivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56. Bladder paragangliomas are frequently mistaken for other bladder neoplasms or functional disorders due to their variable presentation. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, but definitive confirmation relies on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Surgical excision remains the gold standard for treatment, with long-term follow-up necessary due to the potential for recurrence. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of bladder paraganglioma, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with unexplained hypertensive crises or post-micturition symptoms.

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant concern in cancer patients, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as additional healthcare burdens. While advances in cancer treatment have expanded survival rates, they have also been associated with an elevated risk of VTE, complicating the clinical landscape. This article explores the challenges posed by cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT) management, particularly the dilemma of administering anticoagulation therapy in cancer patients with a heightened bleeding risk. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in reducing symptomatic VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, the lack of a universally accepted risk-stratification model in clinical practice has hindered its routine adoption. Among the existing models, the Khorana score is commonly used but is not definitively superior to others. Moreover, concerns over the absence of substantial survival benefits, metastasis-free survival differences, and the potential for increased bleeding risk have deterred the routine use of thromboprophylaxis in this population. Recent insights from the TARGET-TP trial, which employed a biomarker-driven risk assessment model based on fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, challenge these concerns. The trial demonstrated improved 6-month mortality rates without an associated increase in bleeding risk in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients. However, the trial's limited inclusion of lung and GI cancer patients necessitates further investigation to establish broader applicability. This article underscores the need for refined risk assessment models, evaluates the implications of the TARGET-TP trial's findings, and discusses the evolving landscape of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients.",

The inflammatory cascade not only plays a role in the etiology and development of several psychological disorders but is also a common biological substrate for cardiovascular difficulties in cancer patients (cardio-oncology). Despite mounting evidence of this tripartite link, clinical practice still uses fragmented integrated approaches to treating these interrelated illnesses. The purpose of this review is to compile the most recent data regarding the inflammatory pathways that are common to psychological illnesses, oncological processes, and cardiovascular side effects of cancer treatment. We examine how psychological discomfort in cancer patients worsens cardiovascular outcomes and how cardiovascular problems affect psychological well-being oppositely. Additionally, we assess new inflammatory biomarkers that may be useful for both diagnosis and prognosis in these disorders. This review offers a thorough framework for clinicians and researchers to address the intricate relationships between cancer treatment, psychological functioning, and cardiovascular health. It does so by looking at the most recent developments in anti-inflammatory interventions, pain management techniques, and integrated therapeutic approaches. Our goal is to draw attention to potential targeted therapies that use inflammatory pathway regulation to address several facets of this clinical triad at once.",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent malignant bone tumor that typically impacts young adults is osteosarcoma. Synchronous multifocal osteosarcoma (SMOS) with metastasis is extremely rare, defined by the occurrence of various bone lesions being presented at the time of diagnosis. This report describes a rare case of SMOS with adrenal involvement and a simultaneous abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We report a case of a 34-year-old Palestinian male with a history of hypertension and gout who presented with lower back and right leg pain. Imaging studies showed multiple lytic lesions in the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur, confirming the presence of a metastatic disease. A whole-body CT scan revealed an adrenal mass and an AAA. A core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade SMOS with metastasis. Osteosarcoma is the primary cancerous bone tumor that frequently impacts teenagers and young adults. Although multifocal osteosarcoma is rare, it is characterized by its aggressive nature and its possibility to metastasize. SMOS, which is a less common type, makes up only 0.6% of cases. Metastatic SMOS commonly impacts bones, including the pelvis, spine, and femur. While it is typical for cancer to spread to places like the lungs, the rare occurrence of metastasis to organs like the adrenal glands makes diagnosis and treatment more challenging. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing SMOS with unusual metastatic patterns and significant comorbidities. It emphasizes the importance of using interdisciplinary, comprehensive methods to optimize patient outcomes in such clinical scenarios.",

Its preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and the lack of specific imaging criteria. Often, it mimics other diseases like cancers and infections, complicating early detection. A 51-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and a biliary stricture following stent placement presented with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss for 4 months. A CT scan revealed an indwelling common bile duct (CBD) stent, mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and pneumobilia. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure was performed with stent exchange. Initial CBD biopsy showed chronic inflammation, but both biopsy and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were negative for malignancy. A subsequent ERCP with additional biopsies also returned negative results for malignancy, though CBD brushing tested positive for <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. The diagnosis of biliary tuberculosis is challenging due to its nonspecific presentation. In this case, the positive result for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in the CBD brushing led to the diagnosis, even after negative biopsy and FNA results. Early recognition of hepatobiliary tuberculosis is crucial as it enables conservative management with stents and anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Biliary tuberculosis, although rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained biliary symptoms. Timely diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic procedures can lead to effective treatment with ATT and stenting, improving patient outcomes, and preventing more invasive treatments.",

The respiratory system is uncommonly involved in CSH. We present a local case of pulmonary CSH associated with marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), along with eight additional cases identified from a literature review. A 64-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for coughing, expectoration, and asthma for more than 1 year. Chest CT revealed localized thickening of the tracheal wall, and the bronchoscopy examination showed neoplasms of the trachea and bronchus mucosa. The lesion was characterized by sheets of histiocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and scattered aggregates of atypical lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical stains and T/B-cell gene rearrangement studies supported the pathological diagnosis of CSH-associated MALT. The patient remained free from the disease after lesion resection via bronchoscopy, with further treatment of targeted therapy. Pulmonary CSH-associated MALT can occur in patients of various ages and genders with non-specific clinical and imaging features. Histopathological examination is essential for differentiating CSH from similar conditions. The pathogenesis of CSH may relate to the overproduction of immunoglobulins, and the immunoglobulin types involved in the cases we described are predominantly kappa light chains. Recognizing CSH is essential for starting a clinical evaluation to identify the underlying neoplasm or associated causes. A conclusive diagnosis relies on pathological examination. More detailed case reports are needed to clarify pathogenesis and improve diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes.",

Initially identified as a cardiotonic steroid with potent effects on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, Ouabain has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, a crucial component of cellular physiology, maintains electrochemical gradients essential for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cellular volume regulation. Since Jens Christian Skou's Nobel Prize-winning discovery in 1957, research has unveiled its broader role in cellular homeostasis and disease. A significant breakthrough was the identification of Ouabain as an endogenous ligand of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, transforming the pump's role from a mere ion transporter to a receptor within a hormonal signaling pathway. This discovery has linked the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump to complex intracellular signaling pathways, with implications for hypertension, heart failure, and cancer. However, emerging evidence suggests that its role extends beyond cardiovascular dysfunction to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In epilepsy, dysregulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump contributes to altered ion homeostasis and hyperexcitability. At the same time, in Alzheimer's disease, its dysfunction has been associated with disrupted calcium signaling, oxidative stress, and amyloid-beta accumulation. Similarly, alterations in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity have been linked to dopaminergic neuron vulnerability in Parkinson's disease.

This study, therefore, probed the action of the LINC00152/miR-103a-3p axis in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and progression of BLCA. LINC00152, miR-103a-3p, and ADORA3 expression in clinical BLCA tissues were tested. LINC00152 was knocked down in BLCA cells alone or combined with miR-103a-3p inhibition or ADORA3 overexpression. The level of EMT- and PI3K/AKT pathway-related genes was assessed with Western blot. Cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and apoptosis were examined with CCK8 and EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Binding of miR-103a-3p to LINC00152 and ADORA3 was validated through RIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. The action of LINC00152 in BLCA progression was verified in vivo. LINC00152 and ADORA3 expression was abundant and miR-103a-3p expression was poor in BLCA tissues. LINC00152 knockdown or PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition repressed malignant behaviors and EMT of BLCA cells. Mechanistically, LINC00152 bound specifically to miR-103a-3p, which targeted ADORA3 and then activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. miR-103a-3p inhibition or ADORA3 overexpression nullified the suppressive impacts of LINC00152 knockdown on EMT and malignant behaviors of BLCA cells. Furthermore, LINC00152 knockdown decreased ADORA3 expression and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. LINC00152 knockdown upregulates miR-103a-3p to reduce ADORA3 expression, thus protecting against the malignant biological behaviors and EMT of BLCA cells.

There is significant heterogeneity between regions: regions with high Social Population Index (SDI) have the highest decrease rate, while regions with low to medium SDI have the fastest increase rate. Age analysis shows that the disease burden is highest in the 50-85 age group, with males having a significantly higher risk than females. The BAPC model predicts that by 2050, global ASMR and ASDR will further decline, and decomposition analysis shows that population growth is the main reason for the increase in burden. Age-standardized mortality rates and ASDR for CRC due to low whole grain diets declined globally between 1990 and 2021, but the absolute number of cases continues to increase. Low whole grain diet is an important modifiable factor in the disease burden of CRC, with significant age, sex, and regional heterogeneity in its impact. Bayesian BAPC model predictions showed a decreasing trend in ASMR and ASDR for colorectal cancer disease burden associated with low grain diets, but the absolute burden continued to increase due to increased aging. Decomposition analyses showed that population growth was the main cause of the increasing burden.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition represents a critical determinant of adverse clinical outcomes and substantial disease burden in cancer patients. Despite the established prognostic value of Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) as composite inflammation-immune-nutrition indices in elderly cancer patients, their utility in early-onset (EO) cancer survivors remains unclear. This retrospective study evaluated GNRI and CONUT for predicting mortality in 3,273 early-onset (EO) cancer survivors, with a development cohort (<i>n</i> = 2,814) from NHANES (1999-2018) and a validation cohort (<i>n</i> = 459) from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (2011-2020). Patients were stratified by GNRI (< 98 vs. ≥ 98) and CONUT (≥ 2 vs. ≤ 1) and grouped into composite risk categories: High-risk (GNRI < 98 + CONUT ≥ 2), Moderate-risk (GNRI < 98 + CONUT ≤ 1 or GNRI ≥ 98 + CONUT ≥ 2), and Low-risk (GNRI ≥ 98 + CONUT ≤ 1). In the development cohort, GNRI < 98 and CONUT ≥ 2 independently predicted elevated risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 3.36, 95%CI = 2.69-4.19, <i>P</i> < 0.001), cancer-specific mortality, and non-cancer mortality. High-risk patients exhibited the poorest survival outcomes compared to Low-risk (all-cause mortality HR = 3.36, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed worse prognosis in GNRI < 98, CONUT ≥ 2, and High-risk groups across all mortality endpoints. Validation cohort results aligned with these findings, reinforcing the prognostic significance of composite nutritional risk stratification. This study is the first to validate GNRI and CONUT as effective composite inflammation-immune-nutrition indices for identifying high-risk EO cancer survivors. Composite stratification combining both indices enhances multidimensional inflammation-immune-nutrition risk assessment, offering a practical framework for prognostication and personalized care in this population.",

    "title": "Single-Atom Cu Anchored on a UiO-66 Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensor for Trace and Rapid Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds.",
    "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) serve as critical biomarkers in exhaled breath for early-stage cancer patients, and their rapid, trace-level detection holds marked implications for cancer screening. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology demonstrates strong potential for trace VOC gas detection due to its ultra-high sensitivity and immunity to water interference. However, while surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-free semiconductor substrates offer superior spectral stability and selectivity, their sensitivity toward VOC detection remains suboptimal. This study introduces a novel semiconductor-based SERS substrate composed of copper single atoms anchored on UiO-66 (Cu<sub>1</sub>/UiO-66), achieving a record-low detection limit of 10 parts per billion for VOC gases with a rapid 2-min response time, thereby elevating the gas-sensing performance of SPR-free substrates to unprecedented levels. The exceptional SERS activity originates from the highly delocalized electron properties of single-atomic copper, which effectively facilitates single-atom charge transfer processes. Concurrently, the incorporation of copper single atoms modulates the band structure of UiO-66, substantially enhancing the coupling resonance between the substrate and target molecules. In simulated breath tests mimicking lung cancer patients' exhalations, Cu<sub>1</sub>/UiO-66 exhibits remarkable VOC recognition capability and robust anti-interference performance. This work pioneers a new paradigm for ultra-sensitive, rapid detection of trace VOCs in exhaled breath, holding substantial promise for early cancer diagnostics and clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging as significant environmental contaminants affecting bone health, with studies linking their exposure to decreased bone mineral density (BMD), enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and disruptions in the bone marrow microenvironment. While current research highlights the effects on bone and BMD, there is a critical gap in understanding the mechanisms behind these effects. Studies presented here investigate the effects of legacy and alternative PFAS, particularly hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), on bone health using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models. An environmentally relevant mixture of five PFAS was found to promote osteoclastic differentiation of murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) <i>in vitro</i>. Among the five components of the Mixture, the emerging compound, GenX, had the highest propensity to induce osteoclastogenesis. Utilizing pharmacological and genetic approaches, we identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) as a potential mediator of PFAS-driven osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, our <i>in vivo</i> mouse experiments demonstrated a decrease in trabecular and cortical bone thickness as well as altered bone mineral composition in male FVB/N mice exposed to either GenX or PFHxS (2 mg/L) for 12 weeks. Altogether, our results reveal potentially negative effects of PFAS exposure on BMD, bone mineral composition, and overall bone health and underscore the need for further research assessing the health risks associated with exposure to alternative PFAS.",

    "abstract": "The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) is a cross-sectional, schoolbased survey that provides insight into tobacco use and related behaviors among adolescents aged 13-15 years. This study examines trends in tobacco-related attitudes, education, and media exposure among Polish youth, using data from the 2022 GYTS alongside previous surveys conducted in 2003 and 2016. The study sample was stratified by geographical regions: rural areas, small towns, and large cities. Data were collected from 98 schools across Poland, involving 95 schools (96.9%), 224 classes (97.8%), and 3985 students (78.9%). The primary analysis focused on 3573 students aged 13-15 years. Data from 2003 and 2016 GYTS editions were also used for comparison. Sampling, data weighting, and the methodological framework followed WHO guidelines. Between 2003 and 2022, there was a notable decline in the proportion of Polish adolescents receiving tobacco education in school, from 61.4% to 43.1%. Perceptions of the harms of secondhand smoke also fell substantially, from 65.8% to 34.4%. Support for smoke-free policies weakened, with a decline in support for both indoor and outdoor smoking bans. Exposure to anti-tobacco messages in media dropped dramatically, from 89.4% in 2003 to 34.9% in 2022. On the other hand, perceptions that smoking enhances social interactions rose from 40.8% to 45.5%, while tobacco industry advertising and depictions of tobacco use in media remained prevalent, though declining over time. The findings suggest concerning trends in tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors among Polish adolescents, indicating weakened prevention efforts and a shift towards pro-tobacco norms. The decline in tobacco education, public support for smoke-free policies, and media exposure to anti-tobacco messages highlight the need for renewed public health interventions. Strengthening school-based education, reinforcing smoke-free policies, and regulating tobacco portrayals in media are critical to reversing these trends. Additionally, policy measures such as plain packaging and a ban on tobacco displays at points of sale are necessary to protect future generations from tobacco initiation. Without decisive action, there is a risk of undermining the progress made in tobacco control.",

This review provides a comprehensive update on the clinical trials of radiolabeled SSTR-targeting radiopharmaceuticals since 2020, with a focus on somatostatin receptor agonists and antagonists radiolabeled with <sup>68</sup>Ga, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>177</sup>Lu, <sup>161</sup>Tb, <sup>212</sup>Pb, <sup>67</sup>Cu, and <sup>225</sup>Ac. Head-to-head clinical trials demonstrate that radiolabeled SSTR antagonists such as [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-JR11 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-LM3 offer improved lesion detection and tumor-to-background ratios (particularly in liver metastases) compared to radiolabeled agonists like [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC and [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-DOTA-TATE.

    "abstract": "<b>Background.</b> A barrier to early-stage oral cavity cancer detection is the lack of a defined population and screening regimen satisfying risk-benefit considerations. <b>Methods.</b> We constructed a microsimulation model, Simulation of Cancers of the Oral cavity and Risk Exposures (SCORE), that incorporates risk profiles defined by smoking and alcohol exposure. SCORE simulates the development and progression of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) representing benign, dysplastic, or malignant lesions in the US population starting at age 40 y. OPMD high-risk characteristics of malignant transformation informed a biopsy decision rule. SCORE was calibrated to national cancer registry data. We compared life expectancy in those aged 40 to 60 y with OPMDs, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific deaths across screening strategies with and without the biopsy decision rule, assuming screening every 3 y starting at age 50 y. <b>Results.</b> In US men, all screening strategies reduced cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality by at least 26% and 20% compared with no screening. Whether with or without a biopsy decision rule, life expectancy among those aged 40 to 60 y with OPMDs was 36.37 ± 0.01 life-years, a gain of 0.03 life-years. However, the use of the biopsy rule improved diagnostic efficiency with 8 biopsies per treatable diagnosis. Screening with or without the biopsy decision rule in high-risk men demonstrated comparable benefit, reducing cancer-specific deaths by 27% and incidence by 20% compared with no screening. Meanwhile, in the non-high-risk subpopulation, applying the biopsy rule avoided the harms of excess procedures, reducing lifetime biopsies by 38% versus biopsy of all OPMDs while preserving reductions in cancer burden. <b>Conclusions.</b> SCORE enables virtual trials of various screening regimens and target populations. Given the time and cost of clinical trials, SCORE may facilitate the evaluation of new technologies and clinical recommendations. A new oral cancer simulation model with risk factors including degrees of smoking and alcohol exposure, oral lesion features, and sex incorporates more accurate and precise representation of patient risk categories.We evaluated screening strategies for oral potentially malignant disorders with or without risk-stratified biopsy referral in both the general population and subpopulations defined by degrees of smoking and alcohol exposure.Men with a high degree of both smoking and alcohol exposure exhibited a significant reduction in cancer-specific deaths and cancer incidence from screening programs for oral potentially malignant disorders.Screening with risk-stratified biopsy, using a surgical treatment threshold of moderate dysplasia or worse, yielded the greatest efficiency in term of biopsies needed to detect 1 treatable case.",

While the prevailing approach to modeling the probability of cure involves a generalized linear model using a known parametric link function, such as the logit link function, it has limitations in capturing the complex effects of covariates on cure probability. This paper introduces a novel MCM employing a neural network-based classifier for cure probability and an accelerated failure time structure for the survival distribution of uncured patients. An expectation maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in capturing non-linear classification boundaries compared to logit-based and spline-based MCMs, as well as other machine learning algorithms. This enhances the accuracy and precision of cured probability estimates, improving predictive accuracy. The proposed model and estimation method are applied to survival data on leukemia cancer patients, showcasing their effectiveness.",

However, broader application, particularly in solid tumours, is limited by challenges such as antigen escape and tumour heterogeneity. This study aimed to develop an anti-FLAG CAR capable of engaging FLAG-tagged secondary reagents, providing a flexible and adaptable targeting strategy. We engineered a humanised anti-FLAG CAR to engage FLAG-tagged secondary reagents. The initial construct exhibited tonic signalling, which was addressed through structural optimisation. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in solid tumour mouse models expressing either FLAG or a FLAG-tagged secondary targeting reagent. The initial anti-FLAG CAR showed functional activity but exhibited tonic signalling and exhaustion, limiting its therapeutic utility. Structural optimisation significantly reduced exhaustion and improved T cell persistence and functionality. The optimised CAR T cells effectively inhibited tumour growth in models using either FLAG- engineered tumour cells or a FLAG-tagged secondary targeting reagent. Our findings underscore the importance of CAR design in minimising exhaustion and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

A longitudinal cohort study was conducted at two radiotherapy departments in Thessaloniki, Greece, from October 2022 to May 2023. A total of 216 breast cancer patients were enrolled and assigned to a control group (n = 98), receiving standard care, or an intervention group (n = 118), receiving an informational brochure detailing radiotherapy procedures. Validated Greek versions of the Questionnaire for Assessing Fear of Radiotherapy in Oncology Patients (QAFRT), the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), the Information Styles Questionnaire (ISQ), and the Profile of Mood States Short Form (POMS-S) were administered at baseline and upon completion of radiotherapy. At baseline, groups were homogeneous in demographics and clinical characteristics, except for education level (P < 0.0005). Significant reductions in fear scores were observed in the intervention group across all QAFRT subscales (P < 0.0005), including fear of treatment effectiveness, illness during therapy, daily life disruption, and side effects. The intervention group also demonstrated significant improvements in psychological well-being, with reductions in tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, and increased vigor on the POMS-S (P < 0.0005). Symptom burden, as assessed by MDASI, improved significantly across all domains in the intervention group (P < 0.0005). Furthermore, informational needs regarding disease and treatment were significantly reduced in the intervention group post-intervention (P = 0.001), while psychological informational needs remained unchanged. Providing structured, written informational support prior to radiotherapy initiation significantly reduces fear, improves mood states, and alleviates symptom burden in breast cancer patients.

We report a case of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma that was initially misdiagnosed as miliary TB. A 35-year-old nonsmoking male presented with a progressive dry cough and shortness of breath. Chest imaging revealed diffuse bilateral micronodules and a pericardial effusion, raising suspicion for miliary TB. Although acid-fast bacilli smears and a purified protein derivative test were negative, empiric anti-TB therapy was initiated based on radiographic findings. Despite treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated. Further evaluation, including a cervical lymph node biopsy, unexpectedly revealed metastatic, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. A subsequent pericardial biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement. Anti-TB therapy was discontinued; however, the patient's clinical status continued to decline. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of metastatic LA mimicking miliary TB. In low TB-burden settings, it is essential to maintain a broad differential diagnosis and to consider alternative etiologies, such as metastatic malignancies, when confronted with miliary patterns on chest imaging, particularly in the absence of classic TB risk factors or poor response to treatment. Tissue biopsy from accessible sites and immunohistochemistry remain critical for establishing an accurate diagnosis and guiding appropriate management in such complex presentations.

In our study, we investigate tumor spheroids composed of breast cancer cells embedded in three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrices. Through a combination of quantitative experiments, artificial-intelligence-driven image processing, and mathematical modeling, we uncover rapid transitions in cell phenotypes and phenotype-dependent motility among disseminating cells originating from tumor spheroids. Persistent invasion leads to continuous remodeling of the extracellular matrix surrounding the spheroids, altering the landscape of migration phenotypes. Consequently, filopodial cells emerge as the predominant phenotype across diverse extracellular matrix conditions. Our findings unveil the complex mesoscale dynamics of invading tumor spheroids, shedding light on the complex interplay between migration phenotype plasticity, microenvironment remodeling, and cell motility within 3D extracellular matrices.",

We evaluated three well-known machine learning-based models to recognize patients who had outpatient clinic reservations in the mental health-related care units from free-text nursing notes of 1,672 patients. For model training, the patients were children diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or cancer, while evaluation of the model was done on the patients diagnosed with cancer. A stratified fivefold nested cross-validation was used. We designed this as a binary classification task, with the following labels: no support (0) or psychosocial support (1) was needed. Patients with the latter label were identified by having an outpatient appointment reservation in a mental health-related care unit at least 1 year after their primary diagnosis. The random forest classification model trained on both cancer and diabetes patients performed best for the cancer patient population in three-times repeated nested cross-validation with 0.798 mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and was better with 99% probability (credibility interval -0.2840 to -0.0422) than the neural network-based model using only cancer patients in training when comparing all classifiers pairwise by using the Bayesian correlated t-test. Using machine learning to predict childhood cancer patients needing psychosocial support was possible using nursing notes with a good area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. The reported experiment indicates that machine learning may assist in identifying patients likely to need mental health-related support later in life.",

    "abstract": "Low hemoglobin values are associated with cardiotoxicity in patients with melanoma and other cancer entities receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. However, in cancer patients under chemotherapy, enhanced incidence of cardiotoxicity events are also reported with increasing hemoglobin values. So far, the association between hemoglobin values within the normal limits and the incidence of cardiotoxicity in melanoma patients treated with ICI therapy has not been examined. We analyzed 114 melanoma patients receiving ICI therapy (61 ± 13 years; 38 % female) from the prospective Essen Cardio-Oncology Registry (EcoR). Patients with cancer-related anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) were excluded from the analysis. Baseline hemoglobin levels were assessed at patient enrollment before initiation of ICI therapy. Endpoint was the whole spectrum of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT) according to the European guidelines on cardio-oncology with a median follow-up of 464 days. Hemoglobin values and overall CTR-CVT were positively associated with hazard ratio (HR) rising in a J-shaped curve depending on increasing hemoglobin values. Subgroup analysis revealed only a significant association of hemoglobin and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) (HR: 1.417; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.101 - 1.825; <i>p</i> = 0.007). This association also remained significant after adjustment for further confounders. Hemoglobin values within the normal limits are associated with cardiovascular toxicity in terms of CTRCD in this cohort of melanoma patients receiving ICI treatment. Future studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms and validate the clinical utility of hemoglobin as a potential additional biomarker for risk stratification in cancer patients.",

Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)</i> infections pose significant challenges in pediatric oncology settings. Understanding the prevalence, genotypic characteristics, and antibiotic resistance patterns of <i>MRSA</i> aids in improving patients' outcomes. A total of 120 <i>S. aureus</i> isolates from patients receiving chemotherapy for treatment of malignant diseases and developing BSIs during febrile episodes were examined. Isolates were identified using Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK 2-Compact 15. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Molecular characterization included PCR assays for <i>16S rDNA</i>, multiplex PCR for <i>femA, mecA</i>, and <i>PVL</i> genes, and <i>SCC<sub>mec</sub></i> type. Out of 120 isolates of <i>Staphylococcus aureus, 97</i> (80%) isolate possessed mecA gene and were identified as <i>MRSA, MRSA</i> bacteremia harboring <i>PVL</i> gene was detected in cancer patients in Egypt at 26.8% of <i>MRSA</i> isolates. The study identified a higher fatality rate in patients aged 6-10 years (26.7%) compared to other age groups (<i>p</i> < 0.044). Deceased patients exhibited higher leukocyte counts and lower platelet counts. Solid tumor patients had significantly higher neutrophil and monocyte counts. <i>Type II</i> of <i>SCC<sub>mec</sub></i> correlated with survival and mortality, with the <i>PVL</i> gene being a significant factor. <i>Type III</i> showed a higher prevalence of <i>femA and mecA</i> among survivors, while <i>Type IVb</i> was associated with better outcomes. Antibiotic susceptibility revealed high resistance to cefoxitin, cefepime, and Tazocin, but better sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, particularly in <i>Types IV</i> and <i>V</i>. The study highlights the age-related fatality differences and the impact of HCV infection on survival rates.

These include the aseptic abscess syndrome (AA). Diagnosis is based on histopathological examination and the exclusion of infectious, allergic, and cancer causes. The paper presents the case of a 41-year-old woman with inflammatory spondyloarthropathy (HLA-B27 antigen present), treated with secukinumab, who developed a painful, inflammatory tumor in her right breast. Antibiotic treatment was ineffective, and histopathological exami- nation detected leaching mainly from granulocytes. Infectious and oncological background changes and IgG4+ disease were excluded. After the diagnosis was confirmed, glucocorticoid therapy was started, which brought rapid improvement, but after the dose was reduced, the tumor relapsed. The re-escalation of the steroid dose and the discontinuation of secukinumab coincided with the exacerbation of ankylos- ing spondylitis, which forced the inclusion of upadacitinib, which was effective and well tolerated. Single studies show high efficacy of TNF inhibitors as well as IL-6 or IL-1 blockades in the treatment of AA and sec- ondary prevention in patients with failed steroid therapy. There are no reports of AA cases in the literature during treatment with secukinumab. Treatment with upadacitinib has so far not caused AA recurrence.",

This study retrospectively analysed pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection in 91 patients with pre-existing stage II-IV lung cancer at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between June 2015 and June 2024. Among these patients, 78.0% [71/91] were male, and 16.5% [15/91] were receiving ICIs monotherapy at the time of initial pulmonary NTM infection diagnosis (ICIs group). Compared with the non-ICIs group, ICIs-treated patients developed pulmonary NTM infection earlier (median time: 12 months [IQR, 6-18] vs. 21.5 months [IQR, 13-30]; p = 0.004), and had a higher proportion of rapid-growing NTM isolates (73.3% [11/15] vs. 30.3% [23/76]; p = 0.003), predominantly Mycobacterium abscessus complex (40.0% [6/15]). In contrast, Mycobacterium avium complex was the predominant NTM species in the non-ICIs group (71.1% [54/76]). During 12 months of anti-NTM therapy, the ICIs group showed a lower cumulative sputum culture conversion rate (36.4% [4/11] vs. 59.6% [31/52]; p = 0.19) and a longer median time to initial sputum culture conversion (12 months vs. 6 months; p = 0.13), though these differences were not statistically significant. The most commonly administered ICIs drugs were tislelizumab (40.0% [6/15]) and sintilimab (26.7% [4/15]). These findings suggest that ICIs may be associated with earlier development of pulmonary NTM infection in lung cancer patients.

We also assessed Global Health/Quality of Life (QoL). The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) provided data on prostate cancer (PCa) patients diagnosed in 2017-2019. All had been treated with RT+ ADT. All had completed EPIC-26 and EORTC QLQ-C30 about 3 years after RT start (n = 663). ADT duration was stratified: Short (< 9 months), intermediate (9-18 months) and long ADT (18-24 months). A group of controls were established from the general population (n = 1,817). Outcome measures were the urinary irritative/obstructive domain summary score (DSS), the bowel and sexual DSSs (EPIC-26) and QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30). Compared to controls, patients had clinically important lower bowel, and sexual mean scores. Urinary irritative/obstructive DSS levels were similar. Overall, 43% (PCa patients) and 20% (controls) reported major sexual problems. In patients aged < 75 years, longer than short ADT duration significantly decreased sexual DSS. QoL was relatively unaffected. Low response rates, selection bias and a lack of pre-treatment data represent the studys´ limitations. Three years post-RT+ADT, PCa patients describe clinically important lower EPIC-26 bowel and sexual DSS compared to controls. Sexual domain levels decreased with increasing ADT duration, particularly in patients < 75 years. Our observations indicate worse AHOs than previously reported and should be considered during pre-treatment counselling of PCa patients.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 5-10% of cutaneous melanoma occurs in individuals with a family history of the disease. While known high-penetrance genes, such as CDKN2A, explain some cases, a substantial proportion of hereditary melanoma remains genetically undefined. Recently, germline variants in genes involved in telomere regulation, including POT1, TERT, ACD, and TERF2IP, have been identified in melanoma-prone families. This study investigated the prevalence and pathogenicity of POT1 variants in a Swedish familial melanoma cohort. Patient/material and methods: A total of 168 familial melanoma cases were screened for CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, and POT1. The population frequency of pathogenic variants (PVs) was assessed using the SweGen and the gnomAD databases. Functional evaluation was performed using a saturation genome editing (SGE) assay. Telomere length analysis was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on blood-derived DNA from melanoma patients and healthy controls. The melanomas of the carriers were reviewed by expert dermatopathologists. Among the 161 CDKN2A/CDK4/BAP1-negative melanoma families included in this cohort, only one likely PV in POT1 (c.676C > A, p.His226Asn) was identified (0.6%). Population data confirmed its rarity. The carrier family exhibited multiple early-onset melanomas, with two out of three invasive cases displaying spitzoid morphology, and several other tumors. No significant telomere length differences were observed between carriers and controls. Two additional POT1 variants of uncertain significance were detected; both were predicted to be benign. POT1 PVs were rare in the studied Swedish familial melanoma cases, implying limited contribution to hereditary melanoma in this population. Nonetheless, the identification of a previously unknown likely PV further supports the need for continued genetic screening in selected cases. POT1 testing should be considered in families with multiple melanomas, early onset and spitzoid histopathology, and co-occurring with other syndromic tumors.",

Combined with conebeam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (oART), this strategy has the potential to create a more efficient treatment workflow and reduce the burden for the patients. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and time consumption of different simulation-free oART workflows for patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) to identify the most suitable option for clinical implementation. Patient/material and methods: Diagnostic CT scans from patients diagnosed with MSCC were used for treatment planning, while CBCT scans from their first treatment session were retrospectively used to emulate the treatments. Four adaptive workflows were defined and assessed: Deformable Supervised (DefSup), Deformable Unsupervised (DefUn), Rigid Supervised (RigSup), and Rigid Unsupervised (RigUn). The supervised workflows involved manual corrections to the target structures, whereas the unsupervised workflows did not include any manual adjustments. Time stamps, segmentation quality, and dose plans were used to evaluate the feasibility of each workflow. A total of 120 simulation-free emulations were performed (based on 27 patients with 30 target sites). The DefSup workflow yielded the highest accuracy in both segmentation and dose distribution. Additionally, with a median time consumption of 6.57 min, this workflow demonstrates a level of reliability and quality suitable for clinical application. The DefSup workflow was found to be the most optimal and safe for clinical implementation, as demonstrated by the successful treatment of the first patient with MSCC using this approach.",

Pre-transplant PFIC1 patients often present with mild dyslipidaemia. This raises the possibility that PFIC1 patients, besides cholestasis, may also experience defects in glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ATP8B1 in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using the Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> mutant mouse, a pre-clinical model of PFIC1. Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> and wild-type mice on normal chow were examined. Hepatic glucose metabolism was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance testing, quantification of fasting plasma glucose, insulin and lipids. Mechanistic studies were conducted in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) and HepG2 cells overexpressing glucagon receptor (HepG2-GCGR). The findings in the mouse model were validated in pre-transplant livers from PFIC1 patients. Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> mice showed decreased levels of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and insulin, indicating normal insulin sensitivity and impaired hepatic glucagon response. PMHs from Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> mice exhibited reduced glucagon-dependent cAMP levels and signalling and had increased expression of Pde4 isoforms. Rolipram-mediated PDE4 inhibition restored glucagon signalling. ATP8B1 knockdown HepG2-GCGR cells also showed increased PDE4D expression and impaired glucagon signalling. Liver tissue from PFIC1 patients exhibited elevated PDE4D and reduced p-CREB levels and very low glycogen content. ATP8B1 deficiency causes upregulation of PDE4D in the liver of Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> mice and PFIC1 patients. PDE4D-mediated glucagon resistance impairs gluconeogenesis and stimulates compensatory glycogenolysis in Atp8b1<sup>G308V/G308V</sup> mice and PFIC1 patients.

Conventional large-bore drains often cause significant pain. Small-bore drains (e.g., 19F Blake drains) may reduce discomfort; however, evidence regarding their use in VATE is limited. This study compared drainage effectiveness and pain between 19F Blake drains and conventional 28F drains after VATE for esophageal cancer. This retrospective study included 77 male patients with middle- or lower-third esophageal cancer who underwent VATE with laparoscopic retrosternal tunneling from November 2018 to November 2022. Fifty-five patients received a 28F conventional drain, and 22 received a 19F Blake drain. Outcomes included drainage duration and volume, pain levels (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), postoperative pneumonia rates, and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) on postoperative day 3. The 19F group reported significantly lower pain scores on postoperative days 1-3 (VAS: 2.95-3.25 vs. 4.07-4.62, p<0.001). Drainage duration and pneumonia rates were similar between groups. The 19F group demonstrated a trend toward higher drainage volume and significantly better preservation of pulmonary function, with smaller declines in FVC (ΔFVC: 0.24±0.20 L vs. 0.63±0.17 L, p<0.001) and FEV1 (ΔFEV1: 0.38±0.25 L vs. 0.58±0.25 L, p=0.02). 19F Blake drains provide similar drainage effectiveness to that of 28F drains, with reduced postoperative pain and better pulmonary function preservation. These findings support the use of 19F Blake drains to improve patient comfort and recovery following VATE.",

This study assesses outcomes in patients with resected NSCLC harboring <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions, comparing them to patients with common <i>EGFR</i> mutations and those with wild-type <i>EGFR</i>. We retrospectively reviewed 3,235 patients who underwent resection for NSCLC at Tri-Service Hospital between 2008 and 2021. After excluding cases lacking <i>EGFR</i> testing, incomplete data, or advanced-stage disease, 44 patients with exon 20 insertions were matched to 602 patients with common <i>EGFR</i> mutations and 729 with wild-type <i>EGFR</i>. Clinical characteristics, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with statistical comparisons performed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent prognostic factors. Patients with exon 20 insertions were younger and more frequently presented with stage IA disease. The 5-year DFS was 79% in the exon 20 insertion group, compared to 81% in the common mutation group and 83.9% in the wild-type group. The 5-year OS was 78.5% for exon 20, 91.9% for common mutations, and 91% for wild-type. While no significant differences in DFS or OS were observed between groups, the exon 20 insertion group had a higher incidence of secondary cancers. Multivariable analysis indicated that exon 20 insertion was independently associated with worse OS, but not with DFS. <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions do not significantly shorten DFS, but are associated with inferior OS in early-stage resected NSCLC.

Fifty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated HPV-associated OPC planned for treatment with primary radiotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from March 04, 2024, to July 09, 2024, were included. All had histologic confirmation of p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor staging and nodal assessment were independently completed by a radiation oncologist and a diagnostic neuroradiologist according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. MRI findings were compared with CT with contrast and FDG-PET/CT. The median patient age was 65, 84% were male, and 80% had <10 pack years of smoking history. Primary tumor sites included the base of tongue (50%), tonsil (48%), and glossotonsillar sulcus (2%). The rate of tumor upstaging with MRI was 12% (6/50), all 6 cases upstaged from T2 or T3 to T4. MRI identified RPLN metastases in 10% (5/50) of cases not identified on CT or PET/CT. Overall, 18% (9/50) of patients had either primary tumor upstaging or newly identified RPLN metastases based on MRI.

The findings highlight the potential of SLN-based co-delivery of DOX and PIP for oral metronomic chemotherapy. The validated LC-MS/MS method ensures precise pharmacokinetic assessment, which is crucial for future clinical translation. This study provides a promising strategy for enhancing oral chemotherapy efficacy.",

    "title": "Epigenetic synthetic lethality as a cancer therapeutic strategy: synergy of experimental and computational approaches.",
    "abstract": "Cancer treatment is an ongoing challenge, as directly targeting oncogenic drivers is often unfeasible in many patients due to the lack of druggable targets. This has led to the exploration of alternative strategies, such as exploiting synthetic lethality (SL) relationships between genes. SL facilitates the indirect targeting of oncogenic drivers, as exemplified by the clinical success of PARP inhibitors against BRCA-mutated tumors. Advances in high-throughput perturbation screens and multi-omics technologies have deepened our understanding of SL relationships, while computational models enhance SL predictions to better reflect biological complexity. However, while numerous experimental and computational methods have been developed to identify SL interactions, difficulties remain in translating these findings into clinical applications.This review combines recent progress on SL relationships in cancer with emerging insights into epigenetic regulation, highlighting how epigenetic drugs (epidrugs) can provide new opportunities for targeted interventions, offering a way to minimize off-target effects and enhance therapeutic precision. To advance SL-based therapies, efforts must focus not only on identifying new SL interactions but also on consolidating existing knowledge and integrating experimental and computational approaches to characterize the vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Strengthening this foundation will be critical for the effective development of SL-based cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "Molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy have shown promise in managing gastric adenocarcinoma. The amplified expression of Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and microsatellite stable (MSI) status serve as indicators of response to targeted therapy and immunotherapy, respectively. This study assessed the frequency of MSI status and HER-2 expression in a pretreated sample of Iranian patients with gastric and gastroesophageal (GE) adenocarcinoma. We conducted HER-2/neu expression and mismatch repair (MMR) system analyses on specimens from patients with gastric and GE adenocarcinoma at the Cancer Institute of Iran. Archival tissues from 135 mainly pre-treated surgical specimens of gastric adenocarcinoma cases were used for HER-2 analysis, and 66 specimens were used for MSI analysis. All specimens were tested for HER-2 amplification, revealing that 11 patients (8.1%) had HER-2 amplification, and three out of 66 examined patients exhibited MSI-H. Patients with HER-2 overexpressed specimens had a shorter median overall survival (OS) compared with HER-2 negative cases (21 months (95% CI: 1.4-40.6) vs. 31 months (95% CI: 22.9-39), p = 0.18). The median disease-free survival (DFS) for HER-2 positive and negative patients was 15 and 28 months, respectively (p = 0.25). The estimated median OS and DFS for patients with negative MSI were 26 and 20 months, respectively. However, none of the patients with MSI-positive status experienced recurrence, metastases, or death within the follow-up period; thus, MSI-H patients had a significantly improved OS and DFS (p = 0.018 and 0.020). HER-2 expression, while less common in our Iranian population compared with North American or Western European countries, showed a nonsignificant trend toward poor outcomes in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. MSI-H status was highly infrequent in our population, suggesting that immunotherapy may not be a beneficial treatment for a significant fraction of Iranian patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. However, a minority may still benefit from it. MSI-H was associated with reduced perineural invasion and improved OS and DFS. Therefore, this hypothesis warrants further investigation in clinical trials to underscore the prognostic significance of HER-2 and MSI status and the value of molecular profiling in guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endoscopic resection (ER) have each been recommended for treatment of early superficial ESCN in the available clinical guidelines; however, the combined application of RFA and ER for treatment of early superficial ESCN remains inconclusive. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of RFA combined with ER in patients diagnosed with early superficial ESCN. Three major bibliographic databases were reviewed for enrollment of case series and cohort studies before September 17, 2023. We included adults with early superficial ESCN who were receiving a combination of RFA and ER, focusing on their end-of-treatment histological complete response (CR), as well as both acute and late postoperative adverse events (AEs) at the follow-up period. Five studies involving a total of 382 participants for analysis were used. The end-of-treatment histological CR, acute and late postoperative AEs were 91% (95% CI, 0.87-0.93), 6% (95% CI, 0.02-0.17), and 21% (95% CI, 0.05-0.57), respectively. With respect to safety, stricture was most commonly encountered. In subgroup analysis, sequential ER followed by RFA achieved similar end-of-treatment histological CR as well as higher acute and later complications postoperatively. For patients diagnosed with early superficial ESCN, endoscopic RFA combined with ER achieved both a feasible end-of-treatment histological CR and tolerable complications postoperatively. The combination of endoscopic RFA and ER may therefore be considered as an alternative choice, although its role in clinical practice remains inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence underscores the importance of cardiovascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). While sex differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes are well established, the question of whether vascular contributions to AD/ADRD vary by sex has only recently garnered attention. In this narrative review, we discuss sex differences in conventional CVD risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), as well as underrecognized female-specific (e.g., menopause history, polycystic ovary syndrome, adverse pregnancy outcomes) and female-predominant (e.g., autoimmune conditions, breast cancer) CVD risk factors. Despite their relevance, these sex-specific considerations are rarely incorporated into current approaches to quantify CVD risk in AD/ADRD research. We offer recommendations to address these gaps and promote the use of sex-informed methods for studying cardiovascular contributions to AD/ADRD in women, which is essential for developing precision strategies to improve outcomes for all individuals at risk of dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: There are extensive sex differences in cardiovascular risk, dementia risk, and their interrelationships. Many cardiovascular risk factors confer greater risk for dementia in women than men. Existing approaches to quantifying cardiovascular risk often overlook sex differences and female-specific factors. Sex-informed approaches are essential for an accurate understanding of cardiovascular contributions to dementia.",

This study describes patient-reported concordance between care goals and treatment intent in advanced cancer compared to other serious illnesses. A post hoc cross-sectional analysis of baseline survey responses was conducted in adult patients enrolled in a multisite trial of advance care planning. Patients reported whether they prefer and whether they are receiving treatment that prioritizes longevity (life-extending care) versus comfort (comfort-focused care). Concordance between care preferences and perceived treatment intent in patients with advanced cancer versus other advanced illnesses was compared. Mortality rates for patients with cancer stratified by perceived care concordance are reported. Among 1099 patients, those with advanced cancer (n = 231) reported similar preference for comfort-focused care (49% vs 48%, p = .47) and had similar 24-month mortality (16% v 13%, p = .25) as patients with other serious illnesses (n = 868).

    "abstract": "Brain metastasis represents the most prevalent form of brain tumors in adults, with a rising incidence resulting from significant advancements in cancer detection and therapeutic interventions. Current treatment protocols advocate for whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients who are not candidates for either surgical resection or stereotactic irradiation. However, cognitive decline remains a major side effect of this treatment modality. Hippocampal-sparing WBRT (HA-WBRT) has been shown to decrease brain toxicity, with the main concern being the probability of developing new brain metastasis in the hippocampal avoidance region. We report a case of a 73-year-old male presenting with multiple brain metastases and treated with HA-WBRT, who then developed a new single pontine lesion shortly after that was found to be located in an under-dosed peri-hippocampal area. We dosimetrically compared the patient's original IMRT plan to three new plans: a standard VMAT plan, an optimized IMRT plan, and an optimized VMAT plan, where optimization incorporated brainstem coverage as a planning objective, resulting in a notable improvement in brainstem dose distribution. HA-WBRT poses a risk of peri-hippocampal metastasis due to underdosing of the upper brainstem that is inherent in HA-WBRT plans. Planning techniques should focus on optimizing coverage of the brainstem in an attempt to decrease this uncommon occurrence.",

We retrospectively analyzed <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> sequencing data and reclassified the <i>BRCA1/2</i> variants of unknown significance (VUS) in Turkish patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers. <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> sequence data of a large cohort were retrospectively analyzed. The sequencing data were reinterpreted in the context of American College of Medical Genetics guidelines, the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles <i>BRCA1/2</i> classification rules, and current public genomic databases. Among the total of 2,713 patients, 254 (9.36%) had <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> variants. A total of 264 <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> variants were detected.

    "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exert a unique delayed effect in clinical practice, although the exact duration of this delay remains inconclusive. To address this, we developed an algorithm-SOTA (Superiority Onset-Time Algorithm) to quantify the delayed effect and estimate the post-onset therapeutic benefit and applied it based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to calculate the delayed effect of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SOTA reconstructs Kaplan-Meier curves from published figures, recovers individual-level data, and applies a piecewise Cox model to identify the optimal breakpoint as superiority onset time (SOT). It also enables the estimation of post-onset efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors by using landmark analysis to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) after the SOT. The code is available at: https://github.com/qihanfan/SOTA. Then we applied SOTA in a meta-analysis of phase II/III RCTs in NSCLC, identified through a systematic search up to Mar 9, 2025. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Pooled estimates of SOT and post-onset HR were obtained. Simulation studies confirmed the accuracy of the SOTA. For survival data reconstruction, the average value of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and maximum deviation between the raw and reconstructed data were 0.008, 0.011, and 0.050, respectively. For the estimation of the SOT, SOTA accurately recovered the true change point of the HR, with relative errors predominantly within ± 5% and coverage probabilities exceeding 95% across all scenarios. In the meta-analysis, 25 RCTs were included after screening. The estimated SOT was 3.64 months for overall survival (OS) and 3.26 months for progression-free survival (PFS). The corresponding post-onset HRs for OS and PFS were 0.68 and 0.47, respectively. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors show a unique delayed effect compared to chemotherapy. The SOTA algorithm provides a quantitative framework for assessing this delay, offering valuable insights for estimating treatment effects and clinical trial design.",

The primary outcome was overall survival. Four cohort studies (2015-2019) were eligible for analysis, including a total of 10,710 patients with TNBC of whom 7,209 underwent radiotherapy.

The micro/nano-roughened SZr surfaces (SZr-MN) were manufactured using sandblasting and chemical vapor deposition. Surface topography, elemental composition, roughness, and contact angle were systematically characterized. Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used to evaluate bacterial adhesion. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human immortalized keratinocytes were used to assess cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. The sandblasting large-grit acid-etching treated titanium (Ti) surfaces (Ti-SLA) served as the control. Ti and SZr implants were inserted into the mandibles of Beagle dogs, followed by radiological, fluorescent, and histomorphometric analyses after 8 and 12 weeks of healing. The SZr-MN surface exhibited micro-scale ravines and gullies densely covered with curled, sheet-like nano-structures, which led to suitable roughness and improved hydrophilicity. Compared to the Ti-SLA surface, the SZr-MN surface demonstrated significantly reduced bacterial adhesion, along with increased adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Consequently, the SZr implant achieved more extensive and denser surrounding bone tissue and enhanced osseointegration compared to the Ti implant, while both showed comparable dimensions of peri-implant soft and hard tissues. The novel SZr implant surfaces demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity, biocompatibility, and proosteogenic effect, leading to enhanced osseointegration and satisfactory soft tissue sealing. Our findings offer a unique perspective on improving the biological activity of zirconia dental implants.",

    "abstract": "Adult zebrafish and neonatal mice can fully regenerate their hearts after partial amputation through proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, the adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capability following cardiac damage. The reason for this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we find that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is accumulated only in the injury hearts of zebrafish and neonatal mice, but not of adult mice, which coincides with the upregulation of DHA synthesis genes in CMs, fibrobasts and macrophages near the injury areas. Inhibition of Fads2, a DHA synthesis enzyme, impairs heart regeneration in both zebrafish and neonatal mice. Injection of DHA remodels transcriptome from injury response to regeneration response and improves cardiac function in adult mice after myocardial infarction. Interestingly, DHA facilitates CM proliferation, but inhibits fibrosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, only DHA, but not oleic acid (OA), can trigger the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d (PPARD) to bind to the promoter regions of heart regeneration related genes such as: Mef2d, Phlda3 and Txndc5 to regulate their expression. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis experiments suggest that DHA binds to PPARD in a distinct manner compared to OA, which may help explain their differing abilities to influence the expression of heart regeneration genes. Our findings demonstrate that the DHA signal plays an essential and evolutionarily conserved role in heart regeneration and provide a therapeutic potential for myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is characterized as a cell death pathway governed by specific gene-encoding requirements, plays crucial roles in the homeostasis and innate immunity of organisms, and serves as both a pathogenic mechanism and a therapeutic target for a variety of human diseases. Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) functions as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor, utilizing its unique Zα domains to detect endogenous or exogenous nucleic acids and its receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains to sense or bind specific signaling molecules, thereby exerting regulatory effects on various forms of PCD. ZBP1 is involved in apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and PANoptosis and interacts with molecules, such as receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), to influence cell fate under various pathological conditions. It plays a crucial role in regulating PCD during infections, inflammatory and neurological diseases, cancers, and other conditions, affecting disease onset and progression. Targeting ZBP1-associated PCD may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for related pathological conditions. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulatory functions of ZBP1 in PCD and its interactions with several closely associated signaling molecules and delineates the diseases linked to ZBP1-mediated PCD, along with the potential therapeutic implications of ZBP1 in these contexts. Ongoing research on ZBP1 is being refined across various disease models, and these advancements may provide novel insights for studies focusing on PCD, potentially leading to new therapeutic options for related diseases.",

This study developed a rapid genotyping system using GeneSoC®, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform with microfluidic thermal cycling capable of completing 50 cycles of PCR within 20 min. To establish optimal analytical conditions, frozen tumor tissues from 67 patients and artificial DNA vectors were analyzed using this system. This system demonstrated a detection limit of at least 5% variant allele frequency for the IDH1 R132H and TERT promoter C228T/C250T mutations. Subsequently, intraoperative testing was performed in 120 cases using this system. The sensitivity and specificity of IDH1 R132H mutation were 0.985 and 0.982, respectively, whereas those of TERT promoter C228T/C250T mutation were 1.000 and 1.000, respectively. These mutations were detected intraoperatively within approximately 25 min after tumor tissue collection. Furthermore, this assay identified tumor boundaries in an IDH-mutated glioma case, where IDH1 R132H mutations could not be detected.

Nuclear receptors (NRs), a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, regulate a broad range of physiological processes including metabolism, immunity, stress response, reproduction, and cellular differentiation. Increasing evidence highlights the involvement of NRs in oncogenesis, with several members demonstrating altered expression and function in brain tumors. Aberrations in NR signaling, encompassing receptors such as androgen receptors, estrogen receptors, estrogen-related receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, NR subfamily 4 group A, NR subfamily 1 group D member 2, NR subfamily 5 group A member 2, NR subfamily 2 group C member 2, liver X receptors, peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors, progesterone receptors, retinoic acid receptors, NR subfamily 2 group E member 1, thyroid hormone receptors, vitamin D receptors, and retinoid X receptors, have been implicated in promoting hallmark malignant phenotypes, including enhanced survival, proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This review aims to explore the roles of key NRs in brain cancer, with an emphasis on their prognostic significance, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting these receptors using selective agonists or antagonists.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the clinical characteristics and prognostic significance of late biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), with a specific focus on recurrences occurring ≥ 5 years after surgery. A retrospective review was conducted of 1106 patients who underwent RARP at our institution between 2011 and 2023. Among them, 552 patients were followed for at least 5 years and stratified into three groups: No recurrence, early recurrence (before 5 years), and late recurrence (at or after 5 years). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify predictors of late recurrence. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate long-term oncological outcomes. In addition, comparative analyses were performed with a cohort of patients who experienced early recurrence. Of the 552 patients, 152 experienced early recurrence and 32 experienced late recurrence. Multivariable analysis identified lymphovascular invasion and seminal vesicle invasion as risk factors for late recurrence. None of the patients with late BCR progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer during the follow-up period; whereas 11% of those with early recurrence developed castration-resistant disease. Late BCR following RARP is not uncommon and is associated with elevated risk in patients exhibiting lymphovascular invasion or seminal vesicle invasion. Patients lacking these pathological features may be appropriate candidates for de-escalated surveillance beyond 5 years postoperatively; whereas those with identified risk factors warrant continued close monitoring to facilitate timely intervention.",

    "title": "Global viewpoints: evolving epidemiology and treatment patterns of prostate cancer in Asia.",
    "abstract": "There are notable regional differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa), whose underlying causes are arguably complex and multifactorial. In this review, we analysed the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, efficacy and safety of therapeutic drugs, prevalence of treatment and testing, and trends in PCa survival in Asian Urological Association member countries. To investigate regional differences in incidence, mortality, and survival, we used the latest data from the GLOBOCAN 2022 edition, CONCORD-3 study data, and the International Monetary Fund database. Asian men tend to present with more aggressive forms of PCa than their Caucasian counterparts. Paradoxically, survival outcomes are often better in Asian populations despite their more aggressive disease profiles. According to the GLOBOCAN 2022 data, PCa incidence is the highest in North America, Oceania, and Europe, but the lowest in incidence and mortality in Asian countries, despite varying significantly across these countries. Many developing Asian countries continue to experience rising mortality rates from PCa, largely due to limited access to PCa screening and disparities in healthcare infrastructure. While PCa treatments demonstrate comparable effectiveness in Asian populations to that in global trials, access to these therapies remains highly variable across the Asia-Pacific region, highlighting the need for access to improved healthcare policies and systems. In developing Asian nations, the 5-year survival rate (5Y-SR) is shown to be positively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, suggesting that economic factors play a key determinant in PCa outcomes in these regions. Our analysis reveals stark disparities between developed and developing Asian countries, particularly in mortality-to-incidence ratios, prostate-specific antigen screening coverage, access to novel therapeutics, and reimbursement policies. Despite medical advances, economic status and health policy infrastructure remain key determinants of PCa outcomes in Asia. Moreover, our analysis of 5Y-SR relative to GDP per capita underscores the colossal impact of the latter on PCa prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained considerable attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as large surface area, strong antibacterial effects, and diverse applications across multiple sectors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of different studies on the synthesis processes, characterization techniques, and broad applications of AgNPs in the pharmaceutical, environmental, and antibacterial domains. The discussion covers various synthesis methodologies, including chemical processes, physical methods, and green synthesis, highlighting their respective merits and limitations. Important characterization techniques include X-ray diffraction (XRD), which determines the crystalline structure; scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which examines surface morphology; transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which reveals internal structure through high-resolution imaging; and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which determines particle size distribution. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is also used to assess shape, size, and colloidal stability. This review further discusses the applications of AgNPs, including drug delivery, cancer treatment, wound healing, and antimicrobial and antiviral therapies. Although AgNPs exhibit several advantages, concerns such as toxicity and cost-effective production persist. This study suggests that with further research, AgNPs could play a crucial role in addressing significant challenges in the health and environmental sectors.",

    "abstract": "Neurovascular-sparing treatment is believed to help preserve erectile function for localized prostate cancer, given the key role of the arterial supply of neurovascular bundles (NVBs) in potency recovery post-treatment. While NVB-sparing radiotherapy (RT) is emerging, imaging methods to assess NVB function are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the functional status of bilateral NVBs using pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound in patients undergoing prostate RT. Fifty-seven patients (mean age: 66.2 ± 7.1 years) were enrolled in this single-institute prospective study. Each patient underwent a transrectal ultrasound scan in the lithotomy position. Bilateral blood flow in the NVBs was measured using pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound. A custom program was developed to automatically detect and analyze the Doppler spectral waveform. Five Doppler parameters were extracted: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), mean velocity (Vm), resistive index (RI), and pulsatile index (PI). Discrepancies in Doppler parameters between the left and right sides were calculated. Patient-reported sexual outcomes were assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP). The Doppler pulsed waveform parameters for the 57 patients were: PSV = 11.0 ± 4.0 cm/s, EDV = 1.3 ± 1.9 cm/s, Vm = 4.0 ± 2.4 cm/s, RI = 0.89 ± 0.14, and PI = 3.46 ± 1.80. Analysis of PSV revealed differing blood flow between the left and right NVBs: 40 patients had <50% difference, 10 patients had a 50%-100% difference, and seven patients had >100% difference. Among patients aged 65 years or younger (n = 11) with EPIC-CP scores, blood flow was negatively correlated to erectile dysfunction (Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.71, p = 0.01). Substantial differences in blood flow between bilateral NVBs were observed. The functional information obtained from NVB Doppler ultrasound may be valuable in guiding individualized NVB-sparing treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasia with papillary-like nuclear characteristics (NIFTP) is characterised by an indolent behaviour and was defined in 2016 to avoid overtreatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). To report the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of patients with NIFTP treated at a Chilean centre between 2016 and 2023. Observational retrospective study. Of 1103 patients with thyroid neoplasia treated with surgery, 104 (9.42%) had NIFTP. Clinicopathological variables were recorded, including ultrasound characteristics, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results, genetic testing when available, type of surgery, tumour size, and follow-up data. Of 104 patients, 85 (81.7%) were female, age of 44 ± 14.2 years and a median tumour size of 1.7 cm (range 0.1-7.1). Eighty-six (82.7%) had available preoperative staging ultrasound: 1 (1.2%), 39 (45.3%), 38 (44.2%), and 8 (9.3%) were ACR-TIRADS 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Sixteen (15%) NIFTP were incidental, which were smaller than non-incidental NIFTP (median 0.4 cm (0.1-2.2) vs. 1.9 cm (0.6-7.1), p < 0.001). Of the 86 FNAB results available, 2 (2.3%), 10 (11.6%), 20 (23.3%), 24 (27.9%), and 30 (34.9%) were Bethesda I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively. Forty-three patients (41.3%) were treated with lobectomy, 58 (55.8%) with total thyroidectomy (TT), and only 3 (2.9%) with TT and lymph node dissection. In Bethesda II patients, surgery was indicated in cases of nodule growth, showing a larger tumour size than other Bethesda categories (3.0 ± 1.4 vs. 1.8 ± 1.02 cm, p = 0.015). ThyroidPrint® was performed in 12 patients with Bethesda III or IV, resulting suspicious in 11 (92%): of these, 8 (67%) underwent lobectomy. There were no significant differences between lobectomy and TT regarding sex, ACR-TIRADS, tumour size, or ThyroidPrint® results. Twelve (11.5%) were multifocal and 5 (4.8%) bilateral. Fifty-two patients (54%) were followed for ≥ 1 year using follow-up criteria and response to treatment for low-risk DTC recurrence. Thirty-four (65%) had excellent response, 15 (28.8%) indeterminate (13 (25%) by biochemical criteria and 2 (3.8%) by ultrasound), 3 (5.7%) incomplete biochemical (2 (3.8%) due to elevated Tg and 1 (1.9%) due to elevated anti-Tg antibodies), and none with incomplete structural response. There were no differences between lobectomy and TT ± lymph node dissection regarding the type of response. At the end of the follow-up, there were no deaths, and no new interventions were required due to recurrence. In this series, NIFTP showed indolent behaviour and excellent prognosis. Ultrasonographically, 90% presented as ACR-TIRADS 3 or 4, with less than 10% as ACR-TIRADS 5. Regarding FNAB, nearly half were indeterminate, one-third were Bethesda V, and none Bethesda VI. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were found between lobectomy and TT.",

    "abstract": "The role of androgens in lung function is contentious, yet their effects on type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII)-derived lung cancer models remain underexplored. This study reveals that androgens provide survival advantages to A549 cells, a male lung adenocarcinoma AECII cell line, by promoting wound healing and enhancing stress resilience. We demonstrated that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly upregulate aquaporin 3 (AQP3) through androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and ERK pathway activation, thereby mitigating cell death under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and cyclic cell-stretching. Testosterone facilitated cellular wound healing by promoting actin cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion complex formation, reliant on AR rather than AQP3. Under air-liquid interface culture conditions, testosterone consistently induced AQP3 upregulation, enhanced actin remodeling, and facilitated cellular wound healing responses. Validation of these findings was achieved through gene expression analyses, protein level assessments, cell imaging, and in vitro wound healing assays. The underlying molecular mechanisms of androgen action were elucidated using AQP3- and AR-specific siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors. These findings underscore the urgent need to investigate the role of sex hormones in lung cancer and other androgen-responsive epithelial models, focusing on their influence on cancer cell survival and motility.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies, particularly due to the frequent development of drug resistance. Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often faces resistance that limits its clinical efficacy. Therefore, identifying molecular markers that modulate paclitaxel responsiveness is critical. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which regulates protein homeostasis, plays a role in cancer progression, apoptosis, and drug resistance, with deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), serving as key regulators. Recent studies suggest that targeting specific DUBs may enhance drug sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of DUB genes in response to paclitaxel treatment. Multiplex RT-PCR and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that USP1, USP5, USP28, and USP34 were downregulated, whereas USP10 and USP36 were upregulated in paclitaxel-treated A549 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in protein levels consistent with mRNA expression for all DUBs except USP10 and USP36, which displayed discordant patterns. Furthermore, paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was verified by altered levels of apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins including PARP, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and p53. The identification of these DUB genes highlights their potential as biomarkers for predicting drug responsiveness and prognosis during paclitaxel treatment, thereby proposing a new direction for improving the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has begun to uncover the molecular characteristics of high grade gliomas. However, an ultrastructural understanding of their pathogenesis remains largely unexplored. Multinucleated giant cells are large cells with multiple nuclei thought to form from the fusion of multiple neoplastic cells. In this study, we aim to elucidate the nature of the multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) within <i>IDH1</i>-wild type glioblastoma (GBM) and <i>IDH1</i>-mutant astrocytoma, grade 4, by characterizing their phenotypes, ontogenies, morphologies, prevalence, significance, and potential impact on tumor progression and treatment resistance. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we examined 30 tumors (18 <i>IDH1</i>-wild type GBMs and 12 <i>IDH1</i>-mutant astrocytomas) and found that they share two types of MGCs. Type 1 is formed by the fusion of several tumor cells. Type 2 seems to be produced by tumor fibrillar cells filled with intermediate filaments (IF) and lipids through two processes, either by cell fusion or by the immigration of naked nuclei to a larger IF-filled tumor cell. Our results showed that MGCs are abundantly present in 43% of cases, making them less rare than previously believed. The two MGC types occurred solely or in combination in both types of gliomas. Furthermore, MGCs appear non-proliferative; and therefore, their contribution to tumorigenesis and proliferation is not yet fully resolved.",

Their detection has increased in recent years due to the widespread use of advanced imaging techniques. However, epidemiological data regarding the various types of adrenal tumors in Eastern Europe remain scarce and show considerable variability. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics, distribution, and temporal trends of adrenal tumors diagnosed in a Romanian tertiary referral center between 2001 and 2022. We conducted a retrospective review of 116 adrenalectomy specimens documented in the Pathology Database of our institution. Demographic characteristics, tumor laterality, histological subtypes, and temporal distribution patterns were analyzed. Adrenal adenomas were the most common tumors (31.9%), followed by pheochromocytomas (24.1%), and adrenal cortical carcinomas (11.2%); other lesions (e.g., cysts, myelolipoma, etc.) were rare. The number of adrenal surgeries increased by 36% in the period 2012-2022 compared to 2001-2011. The prevalence of adrenal adenomas almost doubled in the second study period (38.8% vs. 22.4%, p=0.014).

This study investigated the predictive value and clinical associations of inflammatory markers and depression in cancer patients using machine learning (ML) and statistical modeling. Pancreatic cancer patients (n = 328; mean age, 65 years; majority with stage IV disease) were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depression defined as PHQ-9 ≥ 10). Clinically significant depression was present in 35% of subjects at baseline, and the rate declined at follow-up. Four ML models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting; XGBoost) were trained using routinely collected clinical data and showed comparable performances with moderate but consistent discriminative capacity (AUC: 0.70-0.72). Permutation importance analysis revealed C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and albumin as key predictors of depression. Generalized estimating equations further confirmed that elevated CRP (OR = 1.32, p = 0.001) and NLR (OR = 1.55, p = 0.001) were independently associated with depression.

A total of 80 patients with stage IV NSCLC were enrolled. Baseline assessments included the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, Herth Hope Index (HHI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Response to ICImonotherapy, along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), was evaluated at week eight and through subsequent survival analyses. At week eight, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) were observed in 31.8%, 33.0%, and 35.2% of patients, respectively. PD patients had significantly higher pretreatment CONUT scores, greater anxiety and depression, and more severe fatigue and insomnia than PR patients. Low nutritional risk was associated with improved OS and PFS. Higher HHI scores and lower HADS-A/D, BFI, and AIS scores correlated with better survival outcomes. In multivariate analysis, anxiety was independently associated with PFS, and depression and fatigue independently predicted OS. Pretreatment nutritional status, psychological health, fatigue, and insomnia significantly influence immunotherapy response and survival in advanced NSCLC. These findings underscore the clinical importance of comprehensive baseline assessments to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from targeted interventions before initiating immunotherapy. Addressing nutritional deficits, psychological distress, fatigue, and insomnia early could potentially enhance treatment response and improve survival outcomes, offering valuable insights for personalized cancer care strategies.",

Standard samples and removable partial denture (RPD) frameworks were SLM-printed and then polished using the following methods: mechanical polishing (MP), EP, PP, DP, PDP (PP + DP), DPP (DP + PP), and PDPP (PP + DP + PP). Surface characteristics were analyzed using optical profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Corrosion resistance was assessed through electrochemical testing and ion release experiments. The metal reduction was evaluated by measuring weight loss, major connector and clasp thickness loss, and framework adaptation. The post-processing time for the technician's fine polishing of these frameworks was recorded to further evaluate the polishing quality of the frameworks. All measurements were presented as mean ±standard deviation. Statistical data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and nonparametric one-way analysis. The MP group exhibited the lowest roughness (0.04 ± 0.01 µm), followed by the PDPP group (0.49 ± 0.12 µm). All groups had a passivation film composition predominantly composed of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with a small amount of CrO<sub>3</sub> observed in the PDP group. PDPP exhibited minimal ion release (0.12 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) and stable Nyquist plots. PDPP can significantly reduce the technician's post-processing time (45.75 s, p < 0.05) without compromising the adaptation of the frameworks. PDPP forms a stable passivation film with extremely low ion release and a highly smooth, uniform surface. This significantly reduces the time required for manual post-processing while maintaining the accuracy of RPD frameworks, making it highly suitable for large-scale clinical framework polishing.",

While oncogenic miR-21 has been identified as a key promoter of tumor angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulation, existing approaches fail to visualize this epigenetic regulatory mechanism in real time. To address this gap, we developed two DNA tetrahedron sensors using DNA nanotechnology, enabling precise recognition and real-time visualization of miR-21 and its downstream VEGF mRNA through a dual-target synchronous detection strategy. Our results demonstrate that sensor 1 not only enables real-time imaging of miR-21-mediated angiogenesis in tumor cells but also exhibits robust antiangiogenic activity by specifically disrupting the miR-21/VEGF signaling pathway. This dual functionality effectively suppresses tumor cell migration and invasion. By integrating molecular diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, this strategy overcomes the limitations of conventional single-function sensors. It provides a novel tool for elucidating tumor angiogenesis mechanisms while highlighting the dual applications of DNA nanostructures in precision cancer therapy. This study opens new avenues for antimetastatic therapies based on epigenetic regulation and underscores the translational potential of functional DNA nanodevices in cancer treatment.",

Filters were applied for language (English, Korean), publication type (original article), and time-period (1949-2025). Data were extracted, categorized, and analyzed descriptively. Our search identified 3072 studies, of which 41 met the inclusion criteria. Psychological risk factors, particularly stress, were the most frequently reported top-ranked causal attributions (50.0%), followed by biological risk factors (23.8%), while behavioral risk factors were under-recognized. The Western population was more focused on biological risk factors, whereas non-Western population more frequently reported psychological and environmental factors. Moreover, studies published after 2015 reported an increased emphasis on psychological risk factors, while attributions to fate or chance diminished significantly. The persistent over-attribution of psychological risk factors and under-recognition of behavioral risk factors highlight the need for targeted education and campaigns. Cultural and societal influences shape these perceptions, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based education to improve cancer awareness and prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The spreading of MAPT/Tau pathology is closely associated with the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. A key event in this process is the rupture of endolysosomal vesicles following the intercellular transfer of MAPT/Tau aggregates, releasing the transferred MAPT/Tau species into the cytosol where they can promote the aggregation of endogenous MAPT/Tau. However, understanding of the cellular pathways involved in this process remains limited. In this study, we investigated cellular pathways that prevent endolysosomal vesicle rupture. We established a new <i>C. elegans</i> model of MAPT/Tau spreading by introducing an mCherry-labeled, disease-associated aggregation-prone fragment of human MAPT/Tau (F3ΔK281:mCh) into the six touch receptor neurons. F3ΔK281:mCh transgenic animals exhibited significant neurotoxicity and mechanosensory deficits due to the accumulation of this MAPT/Tau fragment. In addition, its intercellular transmission compromised the endolysosomal system in receiving hypodermal cells. Using this model, we conducted an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen and identified 59 genes critical for maintaining endolysosomal integrity. GO-term analysis revealed an enrichment of genes related to the ESCRT complex, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mRNA splicing, and fatty acid metabolism. Silencing of selected conserved genes exacerbated seeded MAPT/Tau aggregation in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neuron model and triggered endolysosomal rupture in HEK293T cells, confirming the crucial role of endolysosomal damage in seeded MAPT/Tau aggregation. Overall, this study discovered novel cellular pathways that safeguard endolysosomal integrity. These findings may guide the development of therapeutics that improve endolysosomal integrity to halt the progression of MAPT/Tau pathology.",

In a secondary data analysis, we utilized dynamic structural equation modeling to observe the interdependent evolution of caregiver self-perception of sleep difficulty and mood, and caregiver perception of patient symptoms in 141 family caregivers from 12 home hospice programs. During hospice care, caregiver perception of patient symptom burden impacted caregivers' self-reported feelings of anxiousness and depressed mood (b = 0.005, SE = 0.002, CI [0.001, 0.009], p < 0.012) and these perceived worsening mood states increased caregivers' perception of worsening patient symptom severity (b = 0.34, SE = 0.186, CI [-0.054, 0.710], p < 0.037). However, caregiver-reported patient symptom burden exhibited no direct effect on caregiver perception of their own sleep difficulty. Thus, caregiver self-reported sleep difficulty was indirectly impacted by caregiver self-reported mood; as mood worsened, caregiver-perceived sleep difficulty worsened (b = 0.10, SD = 0.024, CI [0.054, 0.148], p < 0.001). As patient death approaches during home hospice, our findings suggest that caregivers' perceptions of patient symptoms and caregiver self-report of mood and sleep difficulty worsen over time and are interrelated. These findings suggest that caregiver mood may influence the experience of sleep difficulty; therefore, interventions that address mood may benefit sleep-focused strategies.",

However, in older patients, comorbidities and frailty may limit the feasibility of this approach. This study evaluates the incidence of Textbook Oncological Outcome (TOO), a composite quality metric in surgical oncology, in patients aged ≥ 70 years undergoing low anterior resection (LAR) for LARC after nCRT and identifies predictors of achieving this benchmark. We retrospectively analyzed 157 elderly patients with LARC treated by nCRT followed by LAR between 2011 and 2023 in three Italian tertiary centers. TOO was defined as R0 resection, no prolonged hospital stays (LOS < 11 days), no major complications (Clavien-Dindo < 3b), no 30-day readmissions, and no 90-day mortality. TOO was achieved in 61% (n = 95) of patients. The most common limiting factor was prolonged LOS, met by 70.7% (n = 111), followed by the absence of 30-day readmission (87%, n = 137). The most consistently achieved components were no major complications (91%, n = 143), R0 resection (98%, n = 154), and no 90-day mortality (100%). Univariate analysis revealed that a lower (y)pTNM stage was the only significant predictor of TOO (p = 0.008), whereas age and surgical approach were not significantly associated. Survival and recurrence did not differ between patients who did and did not achieve TOO. TOO was achieved in a significant proportion of elderly patients undergoing LAR for LARC after nCRT.

Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Baseline Gleason score, blood parameters (PSA, LDH), and sites of metastases (bone, lymph nodes, liver, lung) were recorded. Quantitative PET parameters such as SUVmean (mean standardized uptake value), SUVpeak (peak standardized uptake value), SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value), PSMA-TV (PSMApositive tumor volume), TL-PSMA (total lesion PSMA) were measured. PET response was assessed by RECIP 1.0 (response evaluation criteria in PSMA imaging); biochemical response by PCWG3 (prostate cancer working group 3). Associations with OS were analyzed via uni- and multivariable Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves. No CTCAE grade III-V toxicities occurred. Grade I/II hematologic events included anemia (23.2%), leukocytopenia (18.6%) and thrombocytopenia (9.3%); eGFR declined by 2.5% (grade I/II in 18.6%). Median OS was 11 months; 60.7% of patients died. 74.4% of patients (32/43) showed PSA declines (median - 58%; 14/43 ≥ 50%). Higher baseline PSA (HR 1.001 per ng/mL; P < 0.10) and LDH (HR 1.008 per U/L; P < 0.01) were associated with shorter OS. Patients with progressive disease by both RECIP and PCWG3 had shorter OS than others (11 vs. 22 months; HR 3.3; P < 0.01). Any PSA response predicted longer OS (21 vs. 7 months; HR 0.3; P < 0.01). Presence of liver metastases portended poorer survival (8 vs. 21 months; HR 6.7; P < 0.001). [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T RLT is well tolerated in patients ≥ 75 years.

While p53 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining is frequently used to evaluate TP53 mutation status, specific cut-offs correlating with mutations remain undefined and largely empirical. This study analyzed tumor specimens from 172 patients with MCL with both p53 IHC and TP53 mutation data, categorizing p53 nuclear expression into four groups (0 + , 1 + , 2 + , and 3 +) using digital image analysis. We established IHC cut-offs with 100% specificity for identifying TP53 non-truncating mutations: 5% for 3 + nuclei, 50% for combined 2 + and 3 + nuclei, and an H-score of 150. The combined 2 + and 3 + nuclei percentage showed the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value. Notably, p53 IHC expression did not significantly correlate with the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of TP53 missense mutations. However, patients with both TP53 missense and ATM mutations displayed lower p53 expression compared to those with only TP53 missense mutations. TP53 truncating mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain were associated with null p53 staining, while truncating mutations in the tetramerization domain showed weak to moderate staining. Cases with single nucleotide substitutions involving TP53 splice sites showed weak to moderate p53 staining and lacked 3 + nuclei. In cases where multiple types of TP53 mutations coexisted, the clonally dominant mutation influenced the overall p53 expression level. Finally, we observed significantly worse overall survival in patients demonstrating p53 overexpression by using the above mentioned IHC cut-offs. This study provides essential evidence for interpreting p53 IHC staining and may potentially guide rapid risk stratification of patients with MCL, especially in limited resource settings.",

In a large, randomized Phase III clinical trial (CALGB/SWOG 80405) involving patients with metastatic CRC, high expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway gene GAD1 and low expression of ABAT, indicative of a GABAergic environment, were associated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival outcomes. A metastasis map of human cancer cell lines (MetMap) and functional studies using a microfluidic tumor-on-chip platform demonstrated that high GAD1 expression correlates with increased metastatic potential. Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of GAD1 reduced tumor invasion, while exogenous GABA promoted invasion. Tumor-derived GABA was elevated in Ras-altered tumors. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data confirmed that higher GAD1 expression is associated with worse outcomes in Ras-mutant tumors. These findings establish a role for GABA signaling in tumor invasiveness, particularly in Ras-altered CRC. This study demonstrates using clinical data to inform new discoveries and highlights the need for advanced preclinical model systems that more accurately reflect human physiology to explore these findings.",

Their dysregulation has been strongly linked to cancer progression. LncRNAs influence key aspects of tumor biology, including cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, and therapeutic resistance, acting either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. In hormone-dependent malignancies such as breast and prostate cancers, lncRNAs play pivotal roles by modulating hormone signaling pathways and regulating the expression and activity of hormone receptors, including estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen receptors (AR). Despite increasing evidence of their involvement, many of these lncRNAs remain poorly characterized, and their potential as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets is still under investigation.This review aims to critically synthesize recent advances in the understanding of lncRNAs in hormone-dependent cancers, with a focus on their oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles, involvement in drug resistance, and clinical relevance.

Using pooled clinical data, this study evaluates Tislelizumab's efficacy and safety in advanced ESCC. This review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a comprehensive search conducted across PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar for clinical trials involving ESCC patients treated with Tislelizumab. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs). We evaluated the study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools. Data extraction and pooling were performed using R for single-arm studies and RevMan 5.4 for RCTs. Outcomes were analyzed using pooled medians, hazard ratios for OS and PFS, and relative risks for ORR, DCR, and adverse events. Four studies with 1,202 patients met inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was low to moderate. Pooled data indicate a median OS of 8.6 months and PFS of 4.75 months in the Tislelizumab group, with an overall ORR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.20-0.61) and DCR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.36-0.88). Tislelizumab significantly improved OS (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59-0.78, p < 0.0001), PFS (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.93, p = 0.01), ORR (RR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.22-2.24, p = 0.001), and DCR (RR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, p = 0.001) compared to standard chemotherapy.

There were no significant differences in grade 3 and serious AEs between Tislelizumab and standard chemotherapy. The most common AEs reported included hematologic toxicities, gastrointestinal issues, metabolic disturbances, and biochemical abnormalities. Tislelizumab improves survival and response in advanced ESCC patients, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile.

However, comprehensive data on HBV infection and associated adverse liver diseases in the Chinese population remain limited. This study aimed to analyse the risk factors for adverse liver outcomes in patients who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). A matched retrospective cohort study was conducted from 1 January to 30 September 2013 in Jiangshan and Shiqi towns in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. Data were sourced from the Yinzhou Health Information System. HBsAg-positive patients were matched 1:2 by birth year, sex, town and calendar period with HBsAg-negative controls. Adverse liver diseases, including cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure, were identified as outcomes, with follow-up continuing until 31 December 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between HBV infection and the risks of adverse liver disease and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, sex, education, location, tobacco use, alcohol consumption and physical activity. A total of 1, 454 HBsAg-positive patients and 2, 766 matched controls were included, with 29, 945 person-years of follow-up (median: 9.17 years). During follow-up, 99 participants developed adverse liver diseases and 73 died. Among HBsAg-positive individuals, the incidence rate of adverse liver disease was 8.21 (95% CI: 6.59 to 10.12) per 1000 person-years, with a 12.24-fold higher risk than HBsAg-negative individuals (95% CI: 6.74 to 22.21).

    "abstract": "Grief associated with bereavement is a multidimensional psychological, physiological and behavioural response to the loss of loved ones. Bereaved individuals may experience physical distress, separation anxiety, intense yearning and cognitive confusion, with an increased risk of adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including death. Currently, various tools are used to measure grief in bereaved adults; however, these tools show significant differences in their cultural context and quality of development. Psychometric properties, including reliability, validity and responsiveness, etc., are essential for ensuring the scientific use of grief assessment tools and for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Previous reviews have lacked a standardised methodological framework for psychometric evaluation of grief instruments. Therefore, this study aims to identify and evaluate the psychometric properties of grief assessment instruments in bereaved adults in accordance with the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) methodology. This study will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol 2015 checklist. A systematic search will be conducted across 7 English and 2 Chinese databases from their inception until 1 March 2025. Studies focusing on the psychometric properties of instruments for measuring grief in bereaved adults will be included. 2 reviewers will individually screen and extract the relevant literature. This systematic review will adhere to the COSMIN guidelines for instrument evaluations. A qualitative synthesis approach will be used to aggregate the psychometric properties of each instrument across studies. The COSMIN Risk of Bias Checklist will be employed to assess the risk of bias, while the COSMIN quality criteria will be applied to evaluate the methodological quality of the findings. The principle of taking the lowest rating will be used when summarising the quality of each psychometric property. The overall quality of evidence will then be appraised using a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, which will inform recommendations for the evidence-based use of the instruments. This study is a meta-analysis of data from existing studies that do not involve direct interaction with human participants or the collection of patient-specific information. Consequently, review by an ethics committee was not applicable. The findings of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and shared at relevant conventions. CRD42024573767.",

However, the most appropriate schedule for patient referral is still to be determined. Scores and criteria are debated, with uncontrolled symptoms (pain, dyspnoea, distress, etc) being one of the main indicators. These symptoms are also the leading causes for patients with cancer to seek care in emergency units. Several studies in North America suggested that referral to palliative care from emergency units is feasible and efficient.The aim of this study is to determine if systematic early referral to palliative care in a context of emergency reduces aggressiveness of care near the end of life compared with referral on medical team request. This multicentric randomised study plans to enrol patients with a PALLIA-10 score >3 attending unscheduled on-site visits in French comprehensive cancer centres, and allocate them to randomisation (1:1) to receive palliative care systematically (experimental group) or on medical oncology team request (standard group). The primary objective is to compare the proportion of patients meeting at least one criterion of clinical care aggressiveness near the end of life, in each group. Secondary objectives include a description of clinical care aggressiveness components, palliative care requirement (psychologist, social worker, nutritional counselling, etc), patient-reported outcomes (FACT-G7, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Edmonton Symptoms Assessment System), the place of death and overall survival. Health economics and human and social sciences substudies will be presented.The study needs to include 192 patients (96 patients per arm) to reach a 20% decrease in care aggressiveness in the last month of life from 65% to 45%, with a statistical power of 80%, and a 2-sided type I error rate of 5%, using systematic referral. Considering a 20% rate of dropout or patients still alive at the time of analysis, 240 patients will need to be allocated to randomisation. This clinical study received approval from the Ethics committee CPP Est III on 25 October 2023, and complies with the MR001 Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (#1994173, 27 September 2016). The first consent was signed on 12 September 2024.Results will be presented and published in international academic journals. V.2.1 dated 10 July 2024. NCT06150027.",

    "abstract": "Injectable hydrogels are promising biomaterials for tissue engineering applications due to their ability to deliver bioactive compounds or cells with minimal invasiveness. Temperature-responsive in situ gelling hydrogels, which undergo transition from liquid to gel in response to temperature stimuli, are desirable candidates for injectable hydrogels. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are well-known temperature-responsive biomaterials for cell scaffolds, drug delivery, and tissue engineering, due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable mechanical properties. However, due to high hydrophobicity and heterogeneous aggregation, the development of injectable hydrogel-derived ELPs remains limited. In our previous study, we designed coiled-coil unit-bound ELPs (CUBEs) hydrogel systems, which integrate ELPs, a polyaspartic acid (polyD) chain, a functional peptide, and a coiled-coil peptide. In this study, we evaluated the injectability and cell delivery potential of a basic CUBE hydrogel system, called O-CUBE (AVGVP)<sub>42</sub>-D<sub>88</sub>-CL. The O-CUBE protein solution was mixed with human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells, serving as a cell model, and subsequently injected into culture medium pre-warmed to 37 °C to initiate in situ gelation. O-CUBE protein was successfully gelled at an approximately 90 % gelation rate after injection at 37 °C within pH ranges of 6-8. Encapsulated HeLa cells exhibited spheroid morphology, indicating that the hydrogel facilitated cell-cell interactions in three-dimensional culture. Further evaluation using a DNA assay revealed that HeLa cells can survive and proliferate within the hydrogel. These results demonstrate that the CUBE hydrogel system is a promising candidate to deliver cells with minimal invasiveness.",

    "abstract": "Remote symptom monitoring using electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) during cancer care provides clinical benefits. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a web application (Moovcare®) for lung cancer care. In this single-site study (NCT05011890), patients with lung cancer (n = 41) were enrolled to 6 months of weekly symptom reporting using Moovcare®. Oncology providers received alerts for concerning symptoms and accessed graphical reports. Feasibility was operationalized as the median percentage of ePROs completed per patient (threshold: ≥65%). Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction with treatment team were assessed at enrollment and 6 months. Clinician acceptability and utility were evaluated with a survey after 6 months of use. Participants averaged 61.5 years of age, and most were female (61.0%), White (73.2%), and had advanced NSCLC (87.8%). The median weekly ePRO completion rate was 76% (IQR: 40%-96%). Alerts occurred in 32/41 (78.0%) of patients, with a mean of 4.2 alerts (95% CI, 2.7-5.69). Clinicians closed alerts in 2.7 (SD 4.0) days. HRQOL was largely unchanged, and satisfaction with provider communication was high. Clinicians (n = 3) felt there was value in symptom monitoring, but electronic health record integration would improve utility. Two out of 3 providers would use the system again and recommend it to others. Remote symptom monitoring was feasible for patients with lung cancer. While symptoms were commonly reported, provider perceptions of alert utility were low. Adjusting alert criteria to highlight actionable symptoms and increasing ePRO use in patients with low participation may increase future utility. NCT05011890.",

Primary outcomes measured were length of stay (LOS), days to oral feeds, days to ambulation, complications within 1 month, and 30-day readmission. Secondary outcomes included days to urinary catheter removal (TOC), use and duration of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), days to decannulation, and days to radiation therapy. Seventy-nine patients were studied: 37 ERAS and 42 pre-ERAS, with comparable baseline demographics. The ERAS group demonstrated significantly shorter median days to oral feeds (8.0 vs 11.0, P = 0.045) and TOC (5.0 vs 11.0, P = 0.007). Respiratory complications were also significantly lower in the ERAS group (0% vs 16.7%, P = 0.009). However, the ERAS group had longer median days to decannulation (8.0 vs 5.0, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in LOS, overall complication rate, or 30-day readmission. Adoption of the ERAS protocol in HNC free flap reconstruction is safe and effective, reducing time to oral feeding, respiratory complications, and days to TOC, though with longer decannulation times, without adversely affecting overall complications or readmissions.",

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted surgery with its advantages such as three-dimensional high-definition vision, dexterous robotic arms, and tremor filtration, is increasingly being applied to complex radical gastrectomy. However, the role of the surgical assistant remains crucial during the procedure. The assistant is responsible for tasks outside the console, including adjusting robotic arms, changing instruments, exposing the surgical field, and addressing unexpected situations. The technical proficiency of the assistant and their collaboration efficiency with the primary surgeon directly impact the smoothness of surgery and patients' outcomes. With the expansion of robot-assisted surgical indications, the establishment of a standardized training system and the optimization of team collaboration models have become urgent challenges to address. This article draws on the author's practical experience as an assistant in robot-assisted gastric cancer surgeries, conducting an in-depth analysis of the responsibilities and operational skills of surgical assistants in robot-assisted procedures. The aim is to develop a relatively comprehensive set of operational guidelines for surgical assistants in robot-assisted radical gastrectomy, providing valuable references for enhancing the overall efficiency of surgical teams and improving surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery, as an increasingly widespread application in the treatment of gastric and colorectal cancer, still faces obvious discrepancies in recommendations, indications, and evidence strength across existing guidelines. This study systematically analyzed 31 relevant guidelines and consensus statements (retrieved from Chinese and English databases from January 2010 to May 2025) from two dimensions: feasibility (effectiveness, safety, etc.) and training quality control.The results showed that colorectal cancer guidelines had a higher proportion (4 guidelines) of \"clear recommendations\" for robotic surgery, while gastric cancer guidelines predominantly presented \"conditional recommendations\" or no recommendations. In the training and quality control dimension, although structured suggestions received positive recommendations, more than half were based on low or very low-quality evidence. Evidence mapping indicated insufficient matching between \"case-specific recommendations\" and evidence grades in the feasibility dimension, while training processes emphasized the importance of standardized systems and team collaboration.The study highlights the existing heterogeneity in evidence-based guidelines for robotic gastrointestinal surgery, with colorectal cancer demonstrating a more mature evidence base and gastric cancer showing notable evidence gaps. It is recommended that future guideline development should strengthen the consistency between recommendation grades and evidence levels, promote high-quality research in upper gastrointestinal surgery, and improve surgeon training and certification systems to facilitate standardized clinical translation of robotic gastrointestinal surgery.",

Use a marker pen to draw a C-shaped seromuscular flap area with a width of 2.5 cm and a height of 3.5 cm 1.5 cm below the residual stomach closure nail, and create a free muscle flap in the gap between the plasma muscle layer and the submucosal layer. Make a transverse incision of 3 cm at the lower edge of the mucosal bed, and intermittently suture the entire lower edge of the gastric wall with 3 stitches. Under laparoscopy, use 4-0 barbed wire to suture the 1 cm wide muscular layer at the top of the tubular stomach and the posterior wall of the esophagus about 5 cm away from the esophageal stump with 3 stitches. Push the upper end of the tubular stomach into the mediastinum, and then tighten the barbed wire to ensure a tight fit between the stomach and the posterior wall of the esophagus. Use an ultrasonic scalpel to remove the esophageal stump, suture the entire posterior wall of the esophagus with the gastric mucosa, and use barbed wire to suture the anterior wall from left to right. The anastomotic site is completely covered with a free muscle flap, and the barbed line is used to continuously suture the muscle flap along the C-shaped line to the gastric pulp muscle layer at the edge of the mucosal bed, embedding the anastomotic site and completing the reconstruction of the digestive tract. <b>Results:</b> Clinical data of 23 patients (18 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and 5 from the Quzhou Hospital affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University) who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, tubular gastroesophageal anastomosis, and pure manual right flap reconstruction surgery for esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma and proximal gastric cancer from October 2023 to August 2024. There were 15 males and 8 females, with an age of (65.3±7.7) years, the BMI was (22.9±2.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All patients in the group successfully completed the surgery, with a surgery time of (218.5±38.1) minutes, including (73.5±19.2) minutes for anastomosis, intraoperative blood loss of (64.5±15.4) ml, postoperative passage of gas on (3.4±0.5) days, first consumption of liquid food after surgery of (3.9±1.1) days, and postoperative hospital stay of (9.1±0.8) days. One patient developed anastomotic stenosis (grade I) after surgery, presenting with mild swallowing obstruction, which returned to normal after dietary adjustment, and there were no cases of secondary surgery. The median follow-up time for the entire group was 4.0 (0.7-7.0) months, during which there were no deaths or tumor recurrence or metastasis, no complications such as anastomotic stenosis or gastric emptying disorders, and no complaints of acid reflux or heartburn. At one month of postoperative follow-up, the reflux symptom index (RSI) score was (3.1±2.9) points, and at three months, the RSI score was (2.4±1.4) points. <b>Conclusions:</b> The application of right-opening single flap valvuloplasty based on tubular stomach for gastrointestinal reconstruction after laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy is safe,feasible,and has satisfactory short-term efficacy.",

There were significant differences in the number of tubers detected among the six sets of images from MR sequences and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR sequences in TSC patients with epilepsy (<i>P</i><0.001), with the highest average number detected by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR [<i>M</i>(<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>): 13(12, 18)]. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR detected a total of 70 nodules in five patients, among which 17 nodules were located in the epileptogenic zone and the remaining 53 nodules were in the non-epileptogenic zone. The proportion of tubers [(64.71%, 11/17) vs (5.66%, 3/53)] (<i>P</i><0.001) and DIR signal value [(366±110) vs (258±74)] in the epileptogenic zone with adjacent hypometabolic cortex were higher than those in the non-epileptogenic zone, while PET standard uptake value (SUV) [1.95 (1.66, 2.21) vs 3.05 (2.41, 3.88)] and T<sub>1</sub>WI signal intensity [(182±31) vs (207±47)] were lower than that those in the non-epileptogenic zone (all <i>P</i><0.05). Low PET SUV values (<i>OR</i>=0.066, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.008-0.583) and the presence of adjacent hypometabolic cortex (<i>OR</i>=9.541, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.277-71.263) were identified as two imaging-related factors associated with intracranial sclerotic tubers located in the epileptogenic zone. <b>Conclusions:</b> <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/T<sub>2</sub>-FLAIR is more effective in detecting intracranial tubers in patients with TSC and epilepsy. Low SUV values of intracranial tubers on PET images and the presence of adjacent hypometabolic cortex are the imaging-related factors for determining whether intracranial tubers are located in the epileptogenic zone.",

The disease course of 4 ears was ≤ 10 days,the course of 16 ears was > 10 days yet ≤ 30 days, the course of 20 ears was > 1 month but ≤ 2 months,the course of 6 ears was > 2 months yet ≤ 1 year, the course of 3 ears was > one year but ≤ two years,and the course of 2 ears was > 2 years. The observation of microstructure and ultrastructure of the different course of outer walls of the auricle pseudocyst was shown:due to various causes of cartilage fluid that separated perichondrium and cartilage tissue, when the perichondrium was stimulated, the bone progenitor cells from the quiescence phase came to the activities period. With the extension of the course, the periosteum was thickening gradually, cartilage the bone progenitor cells idifferentiated into chondroblasts, which idifferentiated into chondrocytes last, from native to mature, from thin to thick. It was stable a period of time when the cartilage mature. The outer wall of the cyst was new cartilage, which reflected additional growth. The nucleus of the chondrocytes evolved into nucleolysis, and necrosis, when the lesions was stimulated.The control group had a thin layer of cartilage and periosteum, containing a small amount of osteoprogenitor cells; the cartilage layer was thick, the cartilage cells were small near the periosteum, and the deep cartilage cells were large, all of which were mature chondrocytes. <b>Conclusions:</b> The outer cartilage of auricle pseudocyst is newborn cartilage. The pathological staging is divided into early stage(cartilage formation), middle stage(cartilage maturity) and late stage(cartilage necrosis).This stage can provide a reference for exploring the pathogenesis of pseudocysts of the auricle and formulating surgical treatment principles.",

To compare the risk of polyp recurrence and colorectal cancer (CRC) among young and old adults after polypectomy. We prospectively examined the risk of metachronous high-risk neoplasia, including high-risk adenoma, high-risk serrated polyp (SP) and CRC, according to index colonoscopy findings among individuals aged <50 years and ≥50 years who had received ≥1 follow-up colonoscopy in the Mass General Brigham Colonoscopy Cohort (2007-2023). We used a multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model to calculate HRs. We identified 37 576 adults without polyps, 26 693 with adenomas and 15 425 with SPs (including 8303 with synchronous adenomas and SPs). Among these 10 977 (29.2%), 3385 (12.7%) and 2659 (17.2%) were diagnosed before age 50 years, respectively. The associations between index polyp findings and subsequent risk of high-risk neoplasia were stronger for age <50 years than ≥50 years; however, such differences disappeared (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>>0.05) once the analysis was restricted to index colonoscopy for screening purposes only. Among screened individuals, in both age groups, the association was particularly strong for individuals with index high-risk lesions and peaked at 3 years after polypectomy, with HRs (95% CI) of 4.60 (3.63 to 5.84) and 5.59 (3.89 to 8.03) for young adults with index high-risk adenoma and high-risk SPs, respectively. Patients undergoing polypectomy at a screening colonoscopy below age 50 years exhibited a similarly increased risk of metachronous neoplasia as those aged ≥50 years, suggesting that current surveillance guidelines developed in old adults may apply to young adults.",

However, the impact of SVI laterality on LN metastasis patterns, nodal burden, metastatic focus size and extranodal extension (ENE) remains underexplored. We retrospectively analysed 225 PCa patients with SVI who underwent radical prostatectomy with LN dissection. Associations between SVI laterality, tumour grade, volume and nodal parameters were assessed using univariable and multivariable models. LN metastases were identified in 97 of 225 (43.1%) patients. Bilateral SVI was significantly associated with higher odds of LN metastasis (OR=2.01; p=0.040), nodal burden (IRR=1.89; p=0.004) and ENE (OR=3.76; p=0.013), independent of tumour volume, grade, age and race. Tumour volume and grade independently predicted LN metastasis (p=0.004 and p=0.048, respectively) and were associated with metastatic focus size (p=0.003 and p<0.001, respectively) and nodal burden (p=0.061 and p=0.045, respectively). LN spread mirrored SVI extent: unilateral SVI primarily led to ipsilateral involvement (22/36; 61.1%; p<0.001), while bilateral SVI increased the risk of bilateral spread (OR=3.81; p=0.003). White patients had significantly higher LN metastasis rates than black patients (p=0.010). Bilateral SVI is a strong, independent predictor of LN metastasis, nodal burden and ENE.

The involvement of the microbiome in tumor initiation and progression underscores its potential as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. Furthermore, microorganisms in the gut and other ecological niches play pivotal roles in shaping cancer immune surveillance and modulating responses to immunotherapy, acting as key mediators connecting gut health to cancer progression. Thus, investigating the intricate interplay between the TME and gut microbiota could offer valuable insights to advance personalized cancer therapies. This comprehensive review explores the complex interactions between the gut microbiota, tumor-associated microbiota, and TME, examining their origins, diversity, connections, and therapeutic implications. We investigate the potential for gut microbiota to translocate to tumors, where they may directly impact the TME and influence cancer progression. We compile the current knowledge on the diversity of intratumoral microbiota across various cancer types and its effects on cellular, immune, and spatial heterogeneity within the TME. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of various methods for characterizing and identifying intratumoral microbiome, emphasizing their importance in understanding their composition and function in the TME. We also explore the therapeutic potential of modulating the gut microbiota, highlighting strategies such as dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, and synthetic biology approaches. We then address the challenges and future directions in this emerging field, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols, advanced sequencing technologies, and refined animal models to enhance our understanding of microbiota-cancer interactions. In conclusion, the gut microbiota represents a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Harnessing the power of gut microbial modulation could lead to novel combinatorial strategies that improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients. Nevertheless, further research is essential to surmount existing challenges and translate these insights into impactful, personalized cancer therapies.",

This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations in HCC, including fatty acid, protein, and amino acid metabolism, and to explore their implications in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Additionally, it highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting key enzymes in metabolic pathways for HCC. Metabolism reprogramming is closely associated with HCC proliferation and metastasis, while the interplay between metabolic pathways further drives disease progression. Targeting key metabolic enzymes and pathways through combination therapies and novel drug development shows promising clinical potential.

This study integrates omics and traditional toxicology to decode its intestinal injury mechanisms in the context of traditional applications.Objective AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to study the damage of CTD to the intestine and preliminarily explore its potential METHODS: In this study, mice were exposed to CTD and the resulting colon injury was assessed by histology and western blotting. The effects of CTD on intestinal flora were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing technology. Integrated transcriptomics and network toxicology were used to explore the mechanism of CTD-induced enterotoxicity. The results showed that CTD reduced body weight and the positive expression areas of acid proteins, shortened the colon and villi, and down-regulated the relative expression of occludin, claudin-1, and zonular occludens (ZO)-1. In addition, CTD decreased the relative abundance of probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased the relative abundance of enteric pathogens such as Helicobacter hepaticus and H. ganmani. After exposure to CTD, 687 differentially expressed genes were identified. These genes were mainly associated with cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways were significantly enriched. Six potential core targets involved in intestinal injury induced by CTD were further screened, and the reliability of the targets was verified by molecular docking and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, this study found that CTD disrupted the intestinal barrier in mice, damaged colon tissue, and disrupted intestinal microbiota homeostasis. The mechanism may involve up-regulation of mRNA expression levels of Ifng, Cxcl9, Cxcl 10, Ccl4, Il1a, and Il1b, and activation of related inflammatory pathways.",

We used <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy to characterise metabolic profiles during in vitro growth of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella species in VDM and BHI. Differences in metabolite production, growth, acidification, and carbohydrate utilisation were assessed. Both L. crispatus and L. jensenii grow well in VDM, produce substantially more lactate than in BHI, and acidify the culture more strongly - better reflecting the low pH environment of Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota. In contrast, G. vaginalis grows less robustly in VDM than in BHI, though key metabolic traits such as the Bifidobacterium shunt and mixed acid fermentation (evidenced by formate production) are preserved. Notably, neither genus consume available glucose, yet still ferment carbohydrates, suggesting a metabolic preference for glycogen over glucose. Evidence of glucose release further indicates glycogen breakdown in culture. VDM more accurately models the metabolic activity and environmental effects of vaginal Lactobacillus species than BHI, particularly in terms of acidification and lactate production. Although G. vaginalis growth is limited in VDM, its characteristic metabolic pathways remain evident. These findings underscore the value of VDM in modelling key metabolic features of the vaginal microbiota, especially under conditions where Lactobacillus dominate or Gardnerella is prevalent.",

We aimed to predict colonoscopy behaviour in middle-aged and elderly adults using machine learning, explore determinants, and develop a web-based tool to improve adherence to diagnostic colonoscopy. We used 49,418 consultation data with positive results of colorectal cancer preliminary screening (defining a positive result in risk assessment or FOBT screening as a preliminary screening positive) from a total of 202,091 consultations in a community-based colorectal cancer screening program between 2013 and 2021 from Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. We established logistic regression (LR), adaptive boosting classifier (Adaboost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict adherence to diagnostic colonoscopy. Our predictors included demographic variables (gender, age, marital status, education level, and occupation), personal health background (history of chronic diarrhoea, chronic constipation, mucus or blood in stool, history of chronic appendicitis or appendectomy, history of chronic cholecystitis or cholecystectomy, cancer history, history of colon polyps), life experiences (whether there have been significant traumatic events causing mental distress or anguish in the past ten years), first-degree relatives' history of colon cancer (father, mother, siblings, children), and personal lifestyle factors (smoking status). We utilise the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to elucidate the importance of variables. Our primary outcome was colonoscopy behaviour. Evaluation metrics, such as ROC curves and AUC values, were used to evaluate model performance. The diagnostic colonoscopy completion rate was 11.5% (5,664/49,418). Adaboost, XGBoost, RF, GBM, MLP and LR reported moderate predictive performance on the testing data (AUC > 60.0%).

Policy frameworks in Europe and Japan reflect growing support for involving patients in research and policymaking. However, tools to assess the actual implementation of PE in clinical trials remain limited. This study introduces a structured, self-evaluation tool for principal investigators (PIs) to assess PE and compares its application to academic trials across Europe and Japan. A two-dimensional matrix was developed to evaluate PE across eight key research steps-research priorities, fundraising, protocol development, informed consent, ethical review, investigator meetings, reporting, and regulatory submission-against five engagement levels (0: none to 4: co-creation). The tool was refined to ensure linguistic and contextual applicability in both regions. A structured questionnaire incorporating the matrix was distributed to PIs identified from public databases. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare PE practices between both regions. Among 178 European and 123 Japanese trials, PI response rate were 24.2% (n=43) and 52.0% (n=64), respectively. Across all research steps, 60.7% of European and 80.6% of Japan trials contained no PE. However, PE was reported in at least one step in 86.0% of European and 39.1% of Japanese trials. When engaging, European trials showed higher levels in protocol development, informed consent, ethical review, and reporting steps than Japan (p < 0.001 for all). This study developed a simple, structured tool to assess PE and applied it to trials in Europe and Japan. It revealed regional differences across culturally and structurally distinct systems, demonstrating its value for cross-context comparison and broader application. By enabling structured assessment and monitoring of PE, this tool supports the implementation of engagement policies across regions. Its adaptability may foster shared learning and cross-border collaboration, especially in regions where engagement frameworks are still emerging.",

In the TCGA cohort, only 72.9% of NSCLC with CDKN2A loss had a concurrent MTAP loss defined by CNV. MTAP IHC seems to be better suited than OPA-NGS to assess the MTAP status in NSCLC, especially as the MTAP gene is not specifically covered within this panel.

All cancer studied by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were queried with TCGAbiolinks R package (RRID:SCR_017683) for mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and clinical data. Differential expression analysis was performed comparing mRNA expression between AA and Caucasians. Survival duration differences were studied using two-tailed log-rank test. Association with survival was quantified using hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to identify CpG sites correlated with mRNA expression. CEACAM7 was the only gene overexpressed among AA comparing to Caucasians with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and its RNA expression was significantly associated with cancer stage, overall survival duration and mortality risk in AA. DNA methylation on CpG probes cg22895231, cg25465322, cg01656853, cg17659920, and cg07940585 were negatively correlated with CEACAM7 mRNA expression, directly associated with survival duration, and inversely associated with mortality risk in AA with LUAD.

To model necrotic cell accumulation, a quasi-steady-state approximation is employed, allowing the necrotic population to be expressed as a function of proliferating cell density. Analytical and numerical analyses of the model reveal that the traveling wave speed is consistently lower than that predicted by the classical Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation, highlighting the significance of phenotypic heterogeneity. In particular, we confirm the role of the switching parameter in modulating invasion speed. Approximate wave profiles derived using Canosa's method show strong agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore, model predictions are validated against experimental data for the U87WT glioblastoma cell line, demonstrating improved accuracy in capturing tumor invasion when both phenotypic switching and necrosis are included. These findings underscore the importance of the go-or-grow-or-die framework in understanding tumor progression and establish a novel, generalizable framework for modeling cancer dynamics.",

    "title": "\"Having a Why to live can bear almost any How\" - Meaning-focused Interventions on Cancer-related Clinical Symptoms: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "According to Dr Viktor Frankl's existential framework, distress in patients' spiritual dimensions could manifest as symptoms in both physical/biological and the psychological dimensions. Meaning-focused interventions (MFI) refer to the subset of spiritual care/existential interventions designed to prominently address cancer patients' loss of meaning in life. To evaluate the effects of MFI on cancer-related physical and psychological symptoms. Search was conducted across 10 databases from inception to October 8, 2024. Primary outcomes included a list of symptoms previously reported as prevalent among cancer patients. Secondary outcome was symptom distress. 23 RCTs and 3 quasi-experimental studies, involving 2,889 patients, were included. Significant effect were found on Fatigue (SMD, -2.48; 95% CI, -3.95 to -1.00; k = 6), Pain Intensity (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.09; k = 2), Insomnia (SMD, -0.74; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.04; k = 4), Depressive Symptoms (SMD, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.18; k = 17), Anxiety (SMD, -0.51; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.25; k = 15), Cognitive Function (MD, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.31; k = 2), Retrospective Memory (MD, -2.90; 95% CI, -5.35 to -0.46; k = 2) and Prospective Memory (MD, -2.22; 95% CI, -3.71 to -0.74; k = 2). Non-significant effects were found on Appetite Loss, Symptom Distress. Our meta-analysis could inform future integration of spiritual care into routine medical care for cancer patients. Meanwhile, findings on cognitive function and memory were based on poor-quality studies and hence should be interpreted with caution. Healthcare providers might consider (i) infusing a meaning-in-life component into physical exercise intervention for cancer patients to reduce dropout, (ii) exploring Low-intensity MFI as a cost-saving option for providing spiritual care.",

    "abstract": "Continuous deep sedation (CDS) for psycho-existential suffering is controversial and often regarded as a last-resort option at the end of life. The frequency with which patients desire CDS for this reason remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of patients with cancer under palliative care in Japan who expressed a desire for CDS to alleviate psycho-existential suffering. It also sought to understand their condition at the time of expressing this desire, underlying suffering, and alternative interventions. This nationwide questionnaire survey involved all certified hospices and palliative care units (PCUs) across Japan. Participants answered a questionnaire regarding the administration of and expressed desire for CDS to relieve psycho-existential suffering, along with patients' status when such a desire was expressed. Data from 306 facilities were analyzed. Approximately 0.2% of deceased patients received CDS solely for psycho-existential suffering, while 2% expressed a desire for it during the two-year study period. While only one-quarter of PCUs reported administering CDS for this purpose, three-quarters reported patients expressing a desire for it, with variation in the proportion across facilities. Patients' desire for CDS was frequently associated with existential suffering and often associated with the wish for an early death. A significant gap existed between patients' desire for CDS due to psycho-existential suffering and its actual implementation. Palliative care providers face the critical challenge of understanding patients' complex needs, providing appropriate care and support, and guiding ethical decisions for patients, families, and medical teams.",

    "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) demonstrates heterogeneous responses to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade, necessitating biomarkers for outcome prediction. Here, we identify tumor keratinization as a key determinant of therapeutic resistance. In 470 LUSC patients, elevated serum CYFRA 21-1 correlated with non-complete pathological response (non-CPR), while CK5/6 immunohistochemistry revealed strong association between keratinization and residual tumor burden (R=0.45, P<0.001). Proteomic profiling of 167 treatment-naïve biopsies stratified patients into distinct subtypes based on keratinization levels. KRT_L (low keratinization) exhibited enhanced immune infiltration, a markedly lower residual viable tumor percentage (P<0.001), and superior survival outcomes (HR=2.28, P=0.034) compared to the KRT_H (high keratinization). Conversely, KRT_H displayed upregulation of keratin proteins, activation of metabolic pathways, and enhanced cancer stemness features, alongside notable immunosuppression. Single-cell RNA analysis confirmed higher keratinization, metabolism and stemness in non-CPR tumors, with trajectory analysis linking undifferentiated states to keratin overexpression. Through integrated proteomic and single-cell analyses, our findings establish keratinization as a hallmark of immune-cold LUSC microenvironments, mechanistically linking elevated keratin expression with both stemness features and impaired immunotherapy efficacy, proposing keratin-based stratification for personalized therapy.",

Although it is widely known to be endemic in tropical countries, several cases have been reported even in metropolitan areas of non-tropical countries. Herein, we report a case of leptospirosis caused by occupational exposure in the Tokyo metropolitan area. A 24-year-old man presented with fever, headache, and systemic arthralgia. Laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function, and impaired renal function. Although he denied any direct contact with rats, his workplace was contaminated with them, which was key to the diagnosis. Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae ST17 was identified as the causative agent based on multilocus sequence typing of the urine sample and the microscopic agglutination test of the paired serum samples. Subsequent epidemiological investigation revealed that L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae ST17 was isolated from rats captured in the vicinity of the patient's workplace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of leptospirosis in Japan in which the same Leptospira genotype was identified in both the patients and the rats trapped around the patient's workplace. Although there is a widespread misconception that leptospirosis is a tropical disease, several cases are reported annually even in non-tropical industrialized cities, such as Tokyo, where rodents play a significant role in human infection. Diagnosis of leptospirosis is sometimes challenging for clinicians, but the first step in diagnosis is to recognize that there is always a risk of infection with Leptospira spp. in any environment potentially contaminated by rats.",

    "abstract": "Bedtime rapid-acting insulin is commonly given to hospitalized patients with moderate hyperglycemia. Its effectiveness has been evaluated in one randomized controlled trial (RCT), the results of which might not generalize to specific populations such as cancer patients. An order set encouraging use of rapid-acting bedtime insulin was replaced with one defaulting to rapid-acting bedtime insulin only for glucoses ≥300 mg/dL, deployed over a two-month period in which approximately half of providers were arbitrarily assigned to the new order set. Analysis assessed the effect of the new order set on whether a less-aggressive bedtime sliding scale was actually ordered and mean morning glucose levels. An inpatient insulin order set was placed for 458 patients. Exposure to the new order set was associated with a 91 % (95 % CI 87 % to 95 %) increase in use of the less-aggressive sliding scale. Mean morning glucose decreased by 16 mg/dL (95 % CI -16 to -1.1 mg/dL, p = 0.035). These results show it is unnecessary to give rapid-acting bedtime insulin for glucoses <300 mg/dL. Further research should be conducted using changes in the order set as a way of conducting well-controlled trials at low cost with minimum disruption to usual clinical care.",

    "abstract": "To assess and compare the feasibility and safety of transarterial and percutaneous fiducial marker placements for gated radiotherapy using real-time tumor-tracking (RTRT) in patients with pancreatic cancer. This retrospective cohort study included 61 patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who underwent transarterial (n = 34) or percutaneous (n = 27) fiducial marker placement between 2015 and 2023. Technical and clinical success, adverse events (AEs), procedure time, number of markers, tumor-to-marker distance, migration, per-marker availability for RTRT, and reasons for marker unavailability were assessed. Both approaches achieved high technical and clinical success rates (transarterial, 91.4% and 97.1%; percutaneous, 96.3% and 96.3%; P = 0.626 and 1.000) without moderate or severe AEs. Mild AEs occurred in 2.9% and 7.4% of patients in the transarterial and percutaneous groups (P = 0.575). The procedure time was shorter in the percutaneous group (35 vs. 50 min [median], P = 0.006). The percutaneous group used more markers (3 vs. 1 [median], P < 0.001). The tumor-to-marker distance was comparable between groups (transarterial, 21 mm; percutaneous, 26 mm [median], P = 0.317). Migration occurred in only one percutaneous case (1.4%). On a per-marker basis, the transarterial group had higher marker availability for RTRT (97.1%) than the percutaneous group (70.8%, P = 0.001). Marker unavailability was due to untraceable shape (transarterial, 1; percutaneous, 12), lack of synchronization with tumor motion (percutaneous, 6), or others (percutaneous, 3). Transarterial and percutaneous fiducial marker placements are safe and feasible for administering RTRT in pancreatic cancer.",

SDOH influences access to all elements of high-quality medical care. Low household income, low educational attainment, and living in disadvantaged, under-resourced or segregated neighborhoods are all linked to lower LCS, lower rates of lung cancer surgery and lower clinical trial participation. Thoracic surgeons must be aware of the impact of SDOH on LCS, access to treatment, surgical outcomes and survivorship. They must incorporate their knowledge with the pre- and perioperative care of their patients with lung and esophageal pathologies as well as lung transplantation. Utilizing examples of successful targeted programming in other spheres of healthcare can provide guidance on how to implement interventions to improve outcomes for thoracic surgery patients.",

Curcumin alone demonstrated a pronounced ability to reduce the boundary potential of lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine, while PMedOz and PEtOz-b-PiPrOz copolymers exhibited either no or weak effects on the electrical properties of biomimetic model membranes. CPh6-PAlOz star-shaped block copolymers were able to interact with K<sup>+</sup>-nonactin. Differential scanning microcalorimetry of the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of membrane lipids indicated that curcumin and all tested macromolecules had more pronounced effects on phosphatidylserine melting than on the phase behavior of phosphatidylcholine. A star-shaped block copolymer with a [PEtOz]/[PiPrOz] ration of 0.8 significantly decreased the melting point of phosphatidylserine. The disordering effects of complexes of curcumin with CPh6, PEtOz-b-PiPrOz copolymers, or the CPh6-PAlOz star-shaped block copolymer with a [PEtOz]/[PiPrOz] ratio of 5 on phosphatidylserine bilayers were less than the algebraic sum of the effects of the polymers and curcumin separately.

While physical activity (PA) supports cardiovascular health and may mitigate frailty-related risks, it also increases air pollution exposure, potentially offsetting its benefits. This study examines their joint associations and the potential modifying role of PA using data from 6,433 individuals aged ≥45 years in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative prospective cohort. Frailty, PA, and air pollution were assessed at baseline. Logistic regression models with multivariable adjustment were used to evaluate associations and interactions. Higher PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> levels were significantly associated with increased CVD risk, with PM<sub>10</sub> showing the strongest association. Frailty was also strongly associated to CVD, while PA was associated with lower CVD risk but without statistical significance. Frailty and air pollution jointly elevated CVD risk, with pre-frail and frail individuals experiencing progressively higher risks, particularly in high-pollution areas. Significant multiplicative and additive interactions were observed, but PA did not significantly modify these associations. Frailty and air pollution synergistically increase CVD risk. Although PA correlates with lower CVD risk, it does not counteract the combined harm of frailty and pollution, underscoring the need for broader interventions to protect vulnerable populations.",

Intraperitoneal aerosolized drug delivery (IPADD) has shown promise as a localized treatment option; however, its efficacy is often limited by inadequate aerosol droplet distribution and poor tissue penetration. In this study, we enhance IPADD using electrostatic precipitation (eIPADD) and evaluate its performance through computational simulations and in vitro/ex vivo experiments. A realistic 3D reconstruction of the human peritoneal cavity was used to simulate the effects of electrostatic fields on droplet distribution and deposition. The results demonstrated that multiple electrodes improved aerosol homogeneity and tissue penetration depth. These findings were validated in vitro, where eIPADD significantly increased droplet coverage and tissue penetration, particularly in anatomically challenging regions. Importantly, increasing the number of electrodes from one to three further enhanced droplet distribution uniformity and tissue penetration depth. While raising the electrical potential improved deposition in key areas, benefits plateaued beyond 10 kV, suggesting a threshold in efficacy. Nevertheless, optimizing voltage within this range, in conjunction with the increased electrode count, remains critical for achieving consistent drug delivery across the peritoneal surfaces and maximizing therapeutic outcomes. Our findings suggest that eIPADD has the potential to address the limitations of conventional IPADD, providing a more effective and uniform drug delivery method for treating PM.",

Although single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) hold potential as drug carriers, their application in ADCs has been limited. This study introduces Albubody, an engineered scFv fused with an albumin-binding domain (ABD), as a potential ADC scaffold designed to interact with serum albumin in vivo. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting Albubody, derived from trastuzumab, is constructed, followed by computational analysis to identify optimal conjugation sites for the cytotoxic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The incorporation of the non-natural amino acid p-azido-phenylalanine (pAzF) enables site-specific conjugation using strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) chemistry, resulting in the formation of the Albubody-drug conjugate (4D5Albu-MMAE). 4D5Albu-MMAE retained HER2 binding affinity, indicating that site-specific conjugation did not compromise antigen recognition. HER2-specific in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular internalization, and efficient spheroid penetration were also confirmed. Compared to the conventional scFv-drug conjugate (4D5scFv-MMAE), 4D5Albu-MMAE exhibited prolonged systemic exposure and superior antitumor efficacy in HER2-positive xenograft models.

C57BL/6 wild-type mice received intratracheal instillations of B(a)P (1 mg/mouse) weekly for 4 consecutive weeks to establish an animal model of lung cancer. FCD interventions were administered ad libitum via drinking water. FCD can reduce the visible tumors occurrence on the surface of the lung at 34 weeks. Club stem cells initially exhibited a decrease in differentiation, followed by a compensatory increase, accompanied by accelerated proliferation and gene damage leading to mutation in the B(a)P-induced lung cancer model in mice. Importantly, single-cell trajectory analysis revealed that FCD promoted the differentiation of club cells into ciliated cells. Correspondingly, FCD promoted the expression of the ciliated cell marker Foxj1 gene in club cells at 26 weeks and 34 weeks. Additionally, FCD decreased the expression of the proliferation marker ki67, the gene damage protein γ-H2AX, and the number of mutated genes in club cells. In conclusion, Intervention with FCD may reduce the incidence of B(a)P-induced lung cancer by restraining the excessive proliferation of club cells, enhancing their differentiation, and mitigating gene damage and mutation.",

    "abstract": "Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein ligand of the ErbB receptor family, playing a critical role in macromolecular signaling that regulates cell growth and survival. Chromosomal rearrangements can fuse NRG1 to other genes, creating oncogenic variants that hijack ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling. The resulting chimeric fusion proteins retain the EGF-like domain of NRG1, enabling aberrant dimerization and sustained activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 macromolecular complexes, which in turn activate downstream pathways such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK. This promotes tumor proliferation, survival, and resistance to targeted therapies such as those against EGFR, ALK, and HER2. Despite being rare (incidence <1 %), CD74-NRG1 is the most common fusion. Detection remains challenging due to large intronic regions, making RNA-based next-generation sequencing the most reliable diagnostic method. NRG1-rearranged tumors represent promising therapeutic targets. Current treatments include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bispecific antibodies. However, clinical data largely originate from case reports and early-phase trials. Although NRG1 fusions are increasingly recognized as oncogenic drivers and precision oncology targets, few reviews have fully examined their biological complexities and therapeutic landscape. This review addresses that gap by integrating insights from basic research and clinical practice. We synthesize recent advancements in NRG1-directed therapies, emphasizing clinical trial outcomes and novel treatment strategies. Challenges and emerging opportunities are also discussed to guide future development. Overall, these findings strongly underscore the urgent need for continued investigation into the structural and functional mechanisms of NRG1 fusions and their clinical translation.",

This study develops a robust prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes and responsiveness to immunotherapy in KIRC based on fibrosis-related gene signatures. Fibrosis-associated genes were curated from three reputable databases (GeneCards, CTD, and OMIM). RNA-sequencing datasets for KIRC were acquired from TCGA, ICGC, and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts. Comprehensive analyses, including differential gene expression, univariate Cox regression, and LASSO Cox regression, were employed to establish and validate a fibrosis-related signature (FRS). Functional enrichment analyses, genomic instability profiling, and assessments of immune cell infiltration were performed to elucidate the biological features of FRS. PDGFRA was examined through single-cell and pan-cancer analyses, with subsequent PDGFRA knockdown created in OS-RC-2 and Caki-1 cell lines. Co-culture experiments with HDF were conducted to evaluate the expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were assessed using CCK8, Transwell assays, and Annexin V/PI staining, respectively, while an in vivo xenograft model was utilized to investigate PDGFRA's role in KIRC. The FRS, incorporating four genes (PDGFRA, SLC40A1, CXCL2, AGTR1), demonstrated strong prognostic capabilities. High-FRS patients experienced significantly worse survival rates, heightened genomic instability, and distinctive immune profiles characterized by increased immune cell infiltration and immune dysfunction. PDGFRA emerged as a significant prognosticator, exhibiting substantial clinical relevance. In vitro silencing of PDGFRA impeded cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis and inhibiting MMP2 and MMP9 expression in HDF. Additionally, PDGFRA knockdown markedly reduced fibrosis and tumorigenicity in KIRC models in vivo. The fibrosis-related signature effectively stratifies KIRC patients according to prognosis and potential immunotherapy responses, enhancing our understanding of fibrosis-mediated tumor biology and enabling personalized therapeutic approaches in kidney cancer.",

    "abstract": "The C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a pivotal role in cellular protein homeostasis by targeting client proteins for proteasomal degradation. DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX17 is a key regulator of RNA metabolism and has been implicated in various cancer-related processes, including Wnt/β-catenin signalling and EMT. In this study, we uncover a novel regulatory axis involving CHIP and DDX17 responsible for modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in colorectal cancer (CRC). Bioinformatic analyses of CPTAC database and immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples revealed a significant negative correlation between CHIP and DDX17. By using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry we have identified DDX17 as a high-confidence interacting partner of CHIP, which was validated through co-immunoprecipitation, domain-mapping, immunocytochemistry, and molecular docking studies, pinpointing the TPR domain of CHIP is essential for this interaction. Mechanistically, CHIP overexpression led to accelerated degradation of DDX17, resulting in reduced β-catenin mRNA stability, leading to the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signalling that results in G1 arrest and decreasing proliferation and EMT. Conversely, CHIP knockdown stabilized DDX17, hence promoting β-catenin signalling that leads to oncogenic phenotype. Our results suggest that CHIP exerts a tumor-suppressive phenotype in CRC by destruction of DDX17, thereby attenuating β-catenin-driven oncogenic processes. Altogether, this study identifies a novel \"CHIP-DDX17-β-catenin\" axis as a critical regulatory mechanism in CRC.",

    "title": "Lipid accumulation in nitrogen and phosphorus-limited yeast is caused by less growth-related dilution.",
    "abstract": "Oleaginous yeasts are used commercially to produce oleochemicals and hold potential also for biodiesel production. In response to nitrogen or phosphorous limitation, oleaginous yeasts accumulate lipids in the form of triacylglycerols. Previous work has investigated potential mechanisms by which nutrient limitation induces lipid biosynthesis without verifying whether lipid biosynthesis flux is actually enhanced. Here we show, using <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing, that in nitrogen or phosphorous limitation, lipid accumulation occurs without consistent increases in biosynthetic flux. Instead, the main driver of increased lipid pools is decreased growth-related dilution. This conclusion holds across two divergent oleaginous yeasts: Rhodotorula toruloides and Yarrowia lipolytica. Quantitative proteomics shows a substantial proteome reallocation in response to nitrogen and phosphorous limitation, with ribosomal proteins strongly downregulated, while lipid enzymes are preserved but not consistently upregulated in absolute quantity. Thus, nutrient limitation, rather than triggering greatly enhanced lipid synthesis, results in roughly sustained lipid enzyme levels and biosynthetic flux. Due to slower lipid dilution by cell division, this suffices to drive marked lipid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most fatal primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by fast development, resistance to standard treatments, and a poor prognosis. Although extensive treatments in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, resistance to therapy and recurrence persist as unavoidable outcomes. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating drug, represents the current standard chemotherapy for GBM. However, its therapeutic effectiveness is severely restricted by its inability to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) properly, its relatively short systemic half-life, and the development of resistance mechanisms, especially those related to O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) repair activity. Nanoparticles (NPs)-based drug delivery devices represent a significant improvement in GBM therapies, providing a viable solution to the challenges of conventional TMZ therapy. Nanocarriers enhance medication solubility, facilitate BBB penetration, target tumor-specific receptors, and minimize general toxicity. This review assesses the function of TMZ in the treatment of GBM, the processes underlying drug resistance, and the potential of nanotechnology to enhance the effectiveness of TMZ. Additionally, we would like to discuss the multifunctional and co-delivery systems of TMZ, along with their pre-clinical and clinical successes and the challenges in bringing these medicines into clinical practice. Therefore, the incorporation of TMZ with nanoparticle-mediated delivery systems signifies a transformative advancement in GBM treatment, offering the opportunity for personalized therapy, overcoming resistance, and markedly enhancing patient survival rates.",

We aimed to externally validate the VTE-PREDICT score in RIETE, a prospective registry of patients with VTE. Exclusion criteria included enrollment before 2012, active cancer, and anticoagulation other than direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), vitamin K antagonists (VKA), or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). VTE recurrence and CRB risks were calculated using VTE-PREDICT for a prediction period from 3 months after the index VTE until the following 1-5 years. Predicted risks were then compared to observed risks. C-statistics and calibration plots were assessed. In total, 17,850 patients (50.3% women) were included in the final analysis, of whom 64.3% had pulmonary embolism. The median age (IQR) was 67 (52-78) years. Regarding long-term anticoagulation, 21.8% of patients were treated with a DOAC, 39.9% with VKA, and 4.8% with LMWH, whereas 33.6% received no anticoagulant treatment. Cumulative incidences of VTE recurrence and CRB at one year (95% confidence interval) were 3.7% (3.4-4.0) and 2.6% (2.4-2.9), respectively. The c-statistics of VTE-PREDICT for 1-5 years varied between 0.70 (0.67-0.72) and 0.73 (0.69-0.76) for VTE recurrence and between 0.65 (0.63-0.67) and 0.67 (0.64-0.70) for CRB. Calibration analysis revealed underestimation of recurrence and overestimation of CRB risk. VTE-PREDICT showed good discrimination for VTE recurrence and moderate discrimination for CRB but underestimated the risk of VTE recurrence in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling plays a critical role in immune cell function. Pseudohypoxia is characterized as iron-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, which can be induced by iron chelators. This study explored whether iron chelators exert antitumor effects by enhancing tumor immune responses and elucidating the underlying mechanisms. The iron chelators Super-polyphenol 10 (SP10) and Deferoxamine (DFO) were used to create iron-deficient and pseudohypoxia conditions. Pseudohypoxia induced by iron chelators stimulates IL-2 secretion from T cells and from both human and murine non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549, PC-3, and LLC). Administration of SP10 reduced tumor growth when LLC tumors were implanted in C57BL/6 mice; however, this was not observed in immunodeficient RAG1-deficient C57BL/6 mice. SP10 itself did not directly inhibit LLC cells proliferation in vitro, suggesting an activation of the tumor immune response. SP10 synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 antibody therapy in lung cancer by increasing the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In conclusion, iron chelation-induced pseudohypoxia activates tumor immune responses by directly upregulating HIF-1α, augmenting T cell function, and inducing IL-2 secretion from T cells, and cancer cells, thereby amplifying the immune efficacy of the PD-1 antibody in lung cancer treatment.",

In this randomized study, adult patients (>18 years) with advanced lung cancer planned for palliative systemic therapy were assigned 1:1 to an intervention or standard care arm. Patients in the intervention arm were paired with a navigator who coordinated investigations, scheduled appointments, facilitated access to services, and conducted regular telephone-based or in-person symptom monitoring. The primary endpoint was change in quality-of-life (QoL) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included time-to-treatment initiation, performance status deterioration, unplanned/emergency visits, treatment compliance, symptom documentation, progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Between February and November 2022, we enrolled 150 patients: 75 per arm. Broad-panel molecular testing was performed more often in the intervention arm (44 % vs. 10 %; P < 0.001); overall molecular testing (any biomarker) in 86 % vs. 77 %. The mean time-to-treatment initiation was significantly shorter in the intervention group (19 vs. 28 days; P < 0.001). Emergency/unplanned visits were less frequent (67 % vs. 88 %; P = 0.002), and compliance was higher (85 % vs. 68 %; P = 0.012) in the intervention arm.

    "abstract": "Laryngeal cancer (LC) remains a major public health concern, associated with considerable morbidity and high mortality. Although incidence has historically declined, mortality reduction has been limited, suggesting underlying disparities in disease management. Thus, long-term trends in LC incidence and mortality, stratified by age, sex, regional affluence, and environmental pollution are of importance. Population-based cohort study included 57,600 patients with LC in Poland from 1999 to 2022. Data were analyzed by sex, age group, regional socioeconomic status (Wealth Indicator), and exposure to industrial pollution (Highly Industrialized Region vs. rest of country). Trend comparisons were assessed using slope analysis, while multiple linear regression was applied to model associations between incidence rate (IR) and mortality rates (MR) and key explanatory variables. Substantial decreases in IR and MR were observed among younger male cohorts (40-59 years), older age groups (60 +) experienced stagnation or increase in mortality. Among women, incidence reductions were less consistent and not mirrored by proportional mortality decreases, especially in the 60-69 and 80 + cohorts. Regions with high environmental pollution showed significantly elevated IR and MR, independently of socioeconomic status. Multivariate models confirmed environmental exposure as a strong predictor of outcomes in the 60-79 age range. Wealth had a moderate impact, affecting mortality more than incidence, particularly in intermediate and low-income regions. This study reveals a shifting burden of laryngeal cancer toward older environmentally exposed populations. It underscores the need for targeted prevention strategies, environmental health policies, and age-specific cancer care improvements.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 40 % of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who receive first-line treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) develop acquired ESR1 mutations, leading to ligand-independent ER activation and resistance to AIs. Fulvestrant, the first selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) approved for clinical use, was developed to address this resistance and has remained the standard second-line endocrine therapy. However, its clinical use is limited by intramuscular administration and low bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, oral SERDs have been developed and have demonstrated superiority over fulvestrant in patients with ESR1-mutant tumors following progression on CDK4/6i plus AI therapy. The positioning of oral SERDs in the treatment sequence is evolving. They are being evaluated not only in the post-CDK4/6i setting but also as first-line therapy in combination with CDK4/6i, and as an early switch strategy guided by detection of emerging ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The SERENA-6 trial demonstrated that early switching to the oral SERD camizestrant in patients with ESR1 mutation detected on ctDNA, prior to radiographic progression, significantly improved progression-free survival and patient-reported outcomes. However, whether molecular progression should routinely trigger treatment change remains an open question, requiring validation through long-term clinical endpoints. In conclusion, the integration of oral SERDs into current therapeutic algorithms poses clinical challenges, and ongoing trials will clarify their role across the disease continuum.",

This is an updated analysis of an international data collection including 49 new patients, accompanied by development of a publicly accessible global database. A retrospective analysis was conducted at 20 international cancer centers, evaluating 143 patients with rare BRAF V600 (V600-nonE/K; 48 %) and non-V600 (52 %) mutations. Treatments included BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy (BRAFi/MEKi) and the respective monotherapies. Clinical outcomes concerning overall response rate (ORR), progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were collected. Included patients had a median age of 65 years (range 20-93), 101 (71 %) were male. Most patients (n = 92, 64 %) received BRAFi/MEKi, 42 (29 %) BRAFi monotherapy, and 9 (6 %) MEKi monotherapy. The ORR was 35 % and higher in V600-nonE/K (45 %) than non-V600 melanomas (26 %, p = 0.025). Median duration of response was similar, with 8.2 months (range 2.9-53.1 +) for V600-nonE/K and 7.4 months (range 0.8-73.8 +) for non-V600. Combination therapy achieved best results in both groups, however, differences between V600-nonE/K and non-V600mutation were only found in ORR (51 % vs. 33 %, p = 0,11) and median PFS (6.5 vs. 3.2 months, p = 0.01). Patients with the longest PFS (> 50 months) had V600D/R, V600_K601D/E/N or K601E/N-, L597V/S/R/Q/P/K- mutations. OS was similar in both groups (16.1 vs. 11.7 months, p = 0.96). Of note, in non-V600 melanomas MEKi monotherapy revealed similar response rates as combination treatment (ORR 33 %, PFS 3 months); however, median OS was shorter (6.6 months, p = 0.02). This updated analysis reinforces the benefit of BRAFi/MEKi therapy in rare BRAF mutations.

Therein, the photothermal compound PTT-Br is fully named 6-bromo-1-ethyl-2-(2-(6-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-xanthen-4-yl)vinyl)quinolin-1-ium, while the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polymer TCM-TK-PEG is fully named tricyano methylene pyridine-thioketal-polyethylene glycol.) with the physiological temperature/photothermal/ROS-responsive drug store and release, thereby maximizing treatment outcomes. After intratumoral injection, PP + GC gel undergoes physiological temperature (37 °C)-responsive sol-gel phase transition, forming stable drug depot for enhanced tumor retention. Upon 635 nm laser irradiation, loaded photothermal agent converts light energy into heat (∼45 °C), triggering photothermal-responsive gel-sol phase transition for actively controlling encapsulated ROS-responsive therapeutic agents release, coupled with photothermal therapy. Subsequently, high levels of ROS in tumor cells disrupt the structure of ROS-responsive therapeutic agents, switching on the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine release and further stimulating immune response. Remarkably, laser irradiation of multiple short-duration induces a stronger immune response than that of single long-duration, thus achieving superior treatment outcomes. Benefiting from the smart control of photothermal therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, active PP + GC gel exhibits a tumor inhibition rate of approximately 82.25 % in melanoma-bearing mouse models, demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy while maintaining excellent biosafety.",

    "abstract": "The BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> pathway and epigenetic machinery are central to melanoma pathogenesis. However, how these processes intersect and their potential for synthetic lethality remains unclear. Here, we identified a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven epigenetic mechanism in melanoma that involves a H3K27 methylation-to-acetylation switch, facilitating metabolic adaptation to targeted therapies. Inhibition of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> downregulates the methyltransferase EZH2, leading to KDM6A-mediated removal of H3K27me3 and a subsequent increase in H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). This H3K27 methyl-to-acetyl conversion shifts chromatin from a repressive to an active state, thereby promoting gene transcription through the acetylation reader BRD4. Specifically, the KDM6A-H3K27ac-BRD4 axis upregulates PGC1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial metabolism, enabling melanoma cells to sustain oxidative metabolism and survive BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-targeted therapies. Blocking this H3K27 methyl-to-acetyl switch disrupted metabolic adaptation and sensitized melanoma cells to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibition. In conclusion, we revealed an epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming mechanism that enables melanoma to survive the treatment with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors, presenting druggable targets within the H3K27 modification pathway that could enhance the efficacy of BRAF-targeted therapies in melanoma patients.",

We assessed the association between HPV vaccination and incidence and clearance of HPV infections among sexually active women in the Carrageenan-gel Against Transmission of Cervical HPV trial, conducted in Montreal, Canada (2013-2020). Participants attended seven visits over 12 months, where they provided self-collected vaginal samples and completed questionnaires on risk factors. Participants self-reported their HPV vaccination status at screening, enrollment, and follow-up visits. Samples were genotyped for HPV using the Linear Array assay. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for incidence and clearance of HPV infections, with the unit of analysis being the HPV type. Analyses considered stringent (reported in ≥2 sources) and non-stringent (reported in ≥1 source) definitions of vaccination status. HPV types were classified as vaccine-targeted (HPVs 6/11/16/18) and non-vaccine-targeted (within-species: HPVs 31/33/35/39/44/45/52/58/59/67/68/70; cross-species: HPVs 26/34/40/42/51/53/54/56/61/62/66/69/71/72/73/81/82/83/84/89). To control for confounding, we applied inverse probability of treatment weights, based on study and participant characteristics. Of 461 participants, 45.8 % and 55.5 % were vaccinated according to the stringent and non-stringent definitions, respectively. Vaccination was associated with a lower risk of new HPVs 6/11/16/18 detection in the most stringent (HR = 0.41, CI:0.23-0.72) and least stringent (HR = 0.41, CI:0.23-0.72) definitions.

    "abstract": "Cancer cells use multiple survival pathways for continuous proliferation, survival, and growth. Recent anticancer drug discovery commonly focuses on a single target that maintains key cancer cell survival mechanisms, where typically, this is a cellular enzyme that inhibits DNA replication, inducing cell damage and apoptosis. Since drugs that act on a single target may be more susceptible to the development of resistance, the search for polypharmacotherapeutics is becoming increasingly popular to defeat drug-resistant cancer cells. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) family members, AXL and MER, have been identified as important cancer targets and found to be overexpressed and associated with various forms of cancers, such as lung and breast cancers. This review has focused on the dual inhibition of AXL and MER kinases as a strategy for treating lung and breast cancer. The roles of these two kinases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are such that dual inhibition would be therapeutically complementary, with MER inhibition more fully blocking tumor growth while AXL inhibition encourages chemosensitivity. Hence, treatment strategies targeting both of these RTKs may be more effective and beneficial than singly targeted agents, and a dual AXL/MER inhibitor is a potential therapy for NSCLC along with breast cancer. This review highlights the preclinical and clinical development of dual AXL and MER kinase inhibitors as lung and breast cancer treatments and the prospects for their future progression.",

Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and computational pathology techniques were employed to assess tumour microenvironment (TME). WGS and EM-seq of 18 samples from 9 patients revealed a low tumor mutation burden (TMB; median = 0.97 mutations/Mb) and no evidence of microsatellite instability (MSI). Driver mutations were identified in TP53 (94 %), PIK3CA (33 %), and PPP2R1A (22 %).

In May 2014, her mildly raised blood sugar (Fasting 138 mg/dL; Post-Prandial 146 mg/dL) was managed by a healthy lifestyle but in 2019, her blood glucose levels were moderately raised (Fasting 153 mg/dL, Post-Prandial 187 mg/dL) hence she was started on oral hypoglycemics which are continued till date. Though the pancreaticobiliary subtype is associated with poor prognosis, it was possible to achieve 12 years and 6 months of disease-free survival with adjunct Oral Ayurvedic Medicines (OAM) possessing antioxidant, immune-modulatory, anti-cancer, and hepato-protective action. She could tolerate chemotherapy with minimal side effects. Her quality of life improved. Her blood sugar levels have been maintained by lifestyle changes and oral hypoglycemics.",

    "title": "Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Synthesis of Evidence.",
    "abstract": "Active surveillance (AS) is a widely accepted strategy for low-risk prostate cancer, but its application to intermediate-risk disease remains controversial. Given the potential to reduce overtreatment without compromising survival, this review evaluates the safety and clinical outcomes of AS in intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IR-PCa), with a focus on favorable intermediate-risk (FIR) subsets. The objective is to synthesize current evidence on AS utilization, selection criteria, oncologic outcomes, and predictors of disease progression.We conducted a narrative review of 85 studies published between 2009 and 2025 identified through PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Search terms included \"AS,\" \"intermediate-risk prostate cancer,\" \"Gleason 3 + 4,\" and \"watchful waiting.\" Eligible studies included prospective and retrospective cohorts, registry-based analyses, and comparative observational studies evaluating AS in IR-PCa. Data were extracted regarding inclusion criteria, follow-up protocols, progression rates, survival outcomes, and use of imaging and genomic tools for risk stratification. AS is increasingly used in FIR patients with low-volume Gleason 3 + 4 disease, low PSA density, and favorable imaging/genomic profiles. In these patients, 5-10 year metastasis-free survival exceeds 95%. However, AS in unfavorable IR disease is associated with higher risks of disease progression and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Limitations include heterogeneity in AS protocols, lack of randomized trials, and variable definitions of FIR. AS is a viable option for well-selected FIR-PCa patients. Incorporating PSA density, mpMRI, and genomic testing enhances risk stratification. Clinical guidelines should support tailored AS approaches with standardized follow-up and timely intervention triggers.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous advancement of cancer treatment technology, cardiotoxicity has gradually become a significant concern regarding the quality of life and long-term prognosis of cancer patients. This review systematically explores the mechanisms of cardiac metabolic reprogramming during cancer treatment, highlighting the impact of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and other drugs on the metabolic balance of cardiac cells. The primary manifestation of this impact is the shift from efficient fatty acid oxidation to inefficient glycolysis dependence. Simultaneously, abnormalities in lipid metabolism, intensified oxidative stress, and the involvement of inflammatory factors gradually impair heart function. The study also emphasizes the role of the \"reverse Warburg effect\" in cardiac cells' response to drug stress, unveiling the complex interplay between metabolism and other non-cardiac cells. This paper also raises the necessity of personalized management strategies, particularly considering the differences in cardiac tolerance among various populations, especially children and elderly patients. Furthermore, it elaborates on the potential applications of multi-omics integration, dynamic monitoring, and digital health management in cardiotoxicity early warning systems. In the future, promoting the integration of basic research and clinical practice, and developing a comprehensive \"prevention-monitoring-treatment\" system, will be key to enhancing the safety of cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Disturbed lactate metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key factor driving malignant tumor progression. Recent studies have revealed that lactate is not only a metabolic by-product of glycolysis, but also an important signaling molecule that regulates tumor cell and immune cell functions. Lactate remodels TME through metabolic-signaling-immune interactions, inhibits the activity of effector immune cells, and promotes the expansion of immunosuppressive cells, thus weakening the anti-tumor immune response. This review systematically describes the regulatory network of lactate metabolism in the TME, focuses on analyzing the role of lactate on different immune cells, and explores innovative therapeutic strategies and clinical translational pathways that target lactate production/transport, neutralize the acidic environment, and multi-target remodeling of lactate homeostasis by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which will provide the basis for the formulation of precise antitumor treatment protocols based on metabolic remodeling and optimization of novel combinatorial therapies, and ultimately achieve an overall enhancement of the effectiveness of clinical cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway with small molecules has exhibited great promise. Herein, to develop the inhibitors with good activity, pharmacokinetic properties and druggability, a novel series of halogens substituted derivatives at the 2-position of the biphenyl group were synthesized, screened, and their inhibitory activity against the PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interaction (PPI) was evaluated through a HTRF assay. Among them, YPD-29B exhibited potent activity with IC<sub>50</sub> value of less than 1 pM. Furthermore, the PBMC-based PD-1/PD-L1 blockade bioassay revealed that YPD-29B could inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and restore T-cell function with the concentration of 10 nM at the cellular level and with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.18 nM. However, the poor solubility of YPD-29B limited the evaluation of antitumor activity in vivo. Thus, the prodrug, sodium salt and hydrochloride of YPD-29B were designed and synthesized to conduct the animal experiments, revealing the obvious anti-melanoma activity of YPD-29B-Na with TGI of 64.11 % and weak toxicity on the blood index and the body weight compared with the positive control CTX. T lymphocyte infiltration markedly increased in tumors of the different treated groups, suggesting the activation of the immune system. Besides, molecular docking verified the rationality of the design. IMMH-010, as a prodrug of YPD-29B has been approved for clinical phase I by NMPA. We hope these above results could offer a novel perspective for the development of PD-1/PD-L1 small molecule inhibitors.",

Further, its association with cancer cell survival, prognosis, and ability to evade apoptosis makes it an important drug target in cancer chemotherapy. Venetoclax (ABP199) is the only FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, the BCL-2 active domain mutations, toxicity, and chemoresistance associated with ABP199 further dampen its future efficacy and positive outcome. Considering the gap and quest for rapid drug discovery, we applied the drug repurposing utility on the database of 3584 drugs (HY-L066, from MedChemExpress (MCE)) from sources like USFDA, EMA, NMPA, PMDA, and Pharmacopeia to identify a plausible lead with the potency to inhibit BCL-2. The HTVS, followed by molecular docking, mechanics using prime MMGB-SA free energy calculations, and MD simulation, led us to identify Stevioside A as a structural lead for the BCL-2. Stevioside displayed a profound and robust interaction and the binding pose within the receptor catalytic site via hydrogen bonding with the ASP103 (hydroxyl group), GLN99 (via the oxygen atoms), and TYR202. TYR202 was also associated with the π-π stacking with the aromatic ring of stevioside, further stabilizing its orientation and affinity towards the receptor. Furthermore, in western blotting studies, the maximal impact of Stevioside was observed at 750 nM concentration, whereby it halved the BCL-2 expression in comparison to the untreated control. This response was comparable to the venetoclax. The outcome hence presents a scope to explore Stevioside A and other top hits in the biological arena and establish their impact as BCL-2 antagonists.",

    "abstract": "While epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) drives cancer metastasis, its regulation by redox dynamics remains poorly understood. Herein, we identified an oxidative stress-responsive CBP/SIRT1 axis that coordinated ZEB1 acetylation at K1108 to promote lung metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, the biochemical and functional analyses revealed that the dual-acetyltransferase CBP, through stabilization and autoacetylation by oxidative stress, formed a dynamic partnership with SIRT1 to execute precision lysine modification. This post-translational rheostat triggered the functional metamorphosis of ZEB1. During this process, ZEB1 dissociation from the transcriptional corepressor CtBP, while recruiting CBP, converts ZEB1 into a transcriptional activator of epithelial genes. The resulting hybrid epithelial‒mesenchymal phenotype orchestrated dual metastatic competence-maintaining stromal interaction capacity through partial epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT) while establishing NADPH-driven redox supremacy to circumvent ferroptosis. Importantly, this acetyl switch of ZEB1 revealed a metastasis-specific therapeutic vulnerability in TNBC. Our work thus highlighted ZEB1 acetylation as a redox-interpreted mechanism coupling phenotypic plasticity with stress resistance, proposing targeted disruption of this protein post-translational modification (PTM) circuit as a precision strategy against metastatic progression.",

In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, exosome-encapsulated miR-1275 was internalized by endothelial cells. Overexpression of miR-1275 in endothelial cells silenced the tight junction protein CLDN1, enhancing vascular permeability and promoting angiogenesis.

    "abstract": "Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), responsible for 20 % of breast cancers cases, is the most lethal and aggressive type. Its resistance to hormonal therapy and frequent development of chemotherapy resistance render conventional treatments inadequate for TNBC. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway, commonly activated in breast cancer, is critical in tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibitors for this pathway have shown to have therapeutic potential and their combinations has led to their active investigation in preclinical and clinical studies for TNBC treatment. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid that shows low toxicity and anticancer activities and inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy in cancer cells. This study investigates the synergistic effect of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, with Berberine on the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line. Cell viability assays demonstrated dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects and a combination of 10 μM berberine and 0.25 μM NVP-BEZ235 was selected as the effective dose at 48 h. Health mammary epithelial MCF-10 A cell line showed less toxicity compared to MDA-MB-231 cells in the combination treatment. MDA-MB-231 cells showed a significant reduction in migratory ability and suppression of cell growth and colony formation ability when treated with combination of Berberine and NVP-BEZ235. Treatment with Berberine and NVP-BEZ235 combination led to an accumulation of cell population at G0/G1 phase of MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Berberine and NVP-BEZ235 showed a significant reduction in n-cadherin and slug gene expression, while e-cadherin gene expression levels increased significantly. Ligand tracer results show that the combination of Berberine and NVP-BEZ235 reflects the stabilizing effect of NVP-BEZ235 on Berberine binding kinetics in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest a synergistic effect of NVP-BEZ235 and Berberine combination inhibiting metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cell line, demonstrating a potential therapy for TNBC.",

Previous studies have revealed that TANTs present a unique transitional state between healthy normal and tumor tissues. However, little or no knowledge exists about the landscape of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in TANTs and how they differ from the tumor tissues. Herein, we integrated the PPI data mapped onto the differentially expressed genes in TANTs and tumor tissues compared to healthy normal tissues. This led to the reconstruction of six tissue-specific PPI networks, including TANTs and breast tumor tissues (viz., Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2, Basal, and Normal-Like). First, these PPI networks were analyzed using network influence and vulnerability analyses from the NetVA R package. Consequently, it revealed 134 vulnerable proteins (VPs), 21 vulnerable protein pairs (VPPs), and 94 influential proteins (IPs) that were present across all six tissue networks. Further, we identified a set of 34 proteins as common hubs and another set of seven proteins as common bottlenecks across all six tissue networks. Next, all VPs, IPs, hubs, and bottlenecks were investigated for their associations with various diseases, including cancers, and found sharing a significant number of well-known cancer-associated proteins, viz., AR, BRCA1, ERBB2, FN1, FOXA1, JUN, MKI67, and NRAS. Thus, by applying network vulnerability, influence, and gene-disease association-based analyses, we suggest lists of known and candidate proteins along with their associated protein complexes potentially involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis and present across TANTs and different breast cancer subtypes.",

A comprehensive understanding of hypoxia's role in tumor development is crucial for creating effective therapies. This requires reliable tools that can specifically identify hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with disease progression in complex living environments, enabling precise theranostics. Nevertheless, a key limitation is the tendency of these probes to disperse from their intended enzymatic targets, which compromises their accuracy in enzyme localization and diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio. Herein a novel ESIPT-based fluorescent probe, BTN, was developed for the detection of NTR. When exposed to NTR, BTN demonstrated a marked fluorescence off-to-on transition at 610 nm, accompanied by a detection limit as low as 0.078 μg/mL. Fluorescence imaging further confirmed its capability to identify the heightened expression of NTR in cancerous cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated that downregulation of HK2 triggered ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting the growth and invasion of lung cancer cells. More significantly, BTN can in situ monitor the inhibition of lung cancer progression by HK2 knockdown under hypoxic conditions (1 % O₂). We anticipate that this probe will provide a valuable tool for gaining a deeper understanding of the biological functions of NTR in cancer, as well as uncovering critical insights into hypoxia-related pathological processes.",

To develop an in silico analysis-aided pharmacochemistry strategy to explore the pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of TCM prescription, using QFM as a model example. An A549 tumor xenograft model was established to evaluate the anti-NSCLC effect of QFM in vivo. Next, in vitro to in vivo pharmacochemistry of QFM was investigated to analyze the chemical components in QFM, plasma, and tumor using UHPLC-MS/MS. Furthermore, a plasma-tissue-target network was constructed to identify candidate compounds and metabolites. Pathway enrichment analysis and mechanism validation were performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of QFM against NSCLC. Finally, the activity of the active compounds obtained according to the key mechanism were evaluated through molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and experimental verification. The animal study demonstrated that QFM affected tumor growth by reducing tumor volume and weight in a nude mouse model. A total of 48 main compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, were identified from QFM. Furthermore, 33 prototype compounds and 6 metabolites were identified in the plasma after QFM treatment, whereas 10 prototype compounds and 2 metabolites were identified in the tumor tissue. The \"in vivo compound-target\" network revealed 18 candidate compounds and 18 common targets. The KEGG enrichment analysis and western blot results indicated that the PI3K-Akt/p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis were the key mechanism underlying QFM's anti-NSCLC effects. Finally, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and SPR validated five compounds involved in the key mechanism, highlighting the excellent binding ability of tetrandrine and blood metabolite 1 (BM1) to the key target p53. Experimental verification further revealed that tetrandrine had a significant inhibitory effect on NSCLC cells and markedly increased the expression of p53 and its downstream apoptosis-related proteins, suggesting that tetrandrine served as the pharmacodynamic material basis of QFM against NSCLC. QFM was effective in the treatment of NSCLC via the PI3K-Akt/p53 signaling pathway. The innovative integration of diverse analytical methods led to new findings that tetrandrine from QFM exerted an excellent anti-NSCLC effect by directly binding to p53 and inducing its expression.

We examine breast tumors and their normal adjacent tissue from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts, and mouse models, and find that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in neighboring adipose tissue. We find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We find that connexin 31 (GJB3) promotes receptor triple negative breast cancer growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo.

In early-stage, low-risk male breast cancer (MBC) patients treated with BCS, adjuvant RT did not demonstrate a significant survival advantage over NRT. After PSM, 15-year OS, RS, and SMR were 31.8%, 15.2%, and 2.14 for RT versus 34.1%, 21.5%, and 2.25 for NRT (p = 0.36, 0.68, and 0.81, respectively). The cumulative incidence of breast cancer-related death (BCRD) and non-BCRD also showed no statistically significant differences between groups (p = 0.06 and 0.75). Machine learning models (Cox, GBM, and XGBoost) confirmed the limited contribution of RT to survival prediction, with the Cox model demonstrating the best discrimination (C-index = 0.713). While RT was associated with a lower risk of death within the first 10 years, its benefit diminished over time. Causal forest analysis revealed notable heterogeneity in treatment effects across subgroups. Patients who were younger, diagnosed earlier, or had stage I disease showed relatively higher estimated benefit from RT, while older patients or those with more recent diagnoses demonstrated attenuated benefit. In elderly, low-risk MBC patients treated with BCS, adjuvant RT was not associated with improved long-term survival. While our findings suggest that RT may be safely omitted in selected individuals, this decision should be made cautiously in the absence of recurrence data. Model-based analyses underscore the importance of tailoring treatment to patient-specific risk profiles. Prospective studies dedicated to MBC are needed to support individualized de-escalation strategies.",

    "title": "Heat shock protein family H member 1 HSPH1 expression correlates with progression and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones that maintain cellular proteostasis under physiological and stress conditions. HSPH1 (Heat Shock Protein Family H Member 1, also known as HSP105 or HSP110) belongs to the HSP110 family and functions as a nucleotide exchange factor for HSP70, enhancing its folding activity. Beyond its canonical role, HSPH1 is increasingly recognized for its involvement in tumor progression. It has been reported to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy in several cancers, including breast, lung, and liver cancer. Pan-cancer transcriptomic analyses have identified HSPH1 as frequently overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while other HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90 are well-studied, the biological role of HSPH1 remains unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed HSPH1 expression in HCC using TCGA and GEO datasets, and validated its clinical relevance in patient samples. HSPH1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with advanced tumor stage and worse overall survival. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses suggested that HSPH1 participates in oncogenic pathways (e.g., p53, cell cycle) and modulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Knockdown of HSPH1 in HCC cell lines inhibited proliferation and colony formation. Together, our findings highlight HSPH1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.",

We performed differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD samples, Osimertinib-tolerant cell samples and SUMOylation-related genes (SRGs). Utilizing Cox regression and LASSO regression, we developed a prognostic model that highlighted five key prognostic genes-BIRC5, AURKA, BLM, NR3C2, and NDC1. These genes were significantly associated with LUAD progression, revealing their predominant expression in epithelial cells, which play a vital role in tumor development. Furthermore, we explored the biological functions and signaling pathways linked to these prognostic genes, discovering that their expression levels and corresponding risk scores could serve as indicators of CD4 T cell and memory B cell activation. The enriched signaling pathways in LUAD were regulated by ubiquitin-related small modifiers, highlighting the complex interplay between SUMOylation and tumor biology. Our findings suggest the important role of SUMOylation-regulated genes in LUAD progression and Osimertinib resistance, suggesting their potential as valuable biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets to enhance treatment strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.",

Knockdown of COL1A1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in both in vitro and xenograft models, as well as suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockdown of COL1A1 also significantly reduced the protein levels of the stemness markers OCT4 and SOX2 in KIRC cells. Additionally, COL1A1 inhibition impaired activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings underscore the pivotal role of the COL1A1/PI3K/Akt axis in KIRC progression and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.",

Three hundred and eleven colorectal cancer patients were recruited from January to July 2023. The questionnaire included a general information questionnaire, a resilience scale (CD-RISC-10), a Chinese cancer empowerment questionnaire (CEQ), and a patient benefit finding scale (BFS). Structural equation models were used to evaluate whether resilience was a mediator between empowerment and benefit finding. Our research found that colorectal cancer patients' resilience score was 19.408 ± 9.011, their empowerment score was 117.453 ± 32.995, and their benefit finding score was 65.752 ± 18.756. Empowerment was positively correlated with resilience (r = 0.116, p < 0.05), resilience was positively correlated with benefit finding (r = 0.187, p < 0.01), and empowerment was positively correlated with benefit finding (r = 0.22, p < 0.01). The fitness indices of the structural models were satisfactory. The indirect effect (a*b) of this pathway (empowerment > resilience > benefit finding) was 0.011 (95% CI 0.003 ~ 0.054). The total effect (c) of empowerment on benefit finding was 0.125 (0.063-0.187), and resilience plays a partial mediating role between empowerment and benefit finding, with the mediating effect (a*b/c) constituting 8.8%. Our research results show that most patients with colorectal cancer exhibit moderate levels of resilience. Resilience plays a partial mediating role in empowerment and benefit finding. Enhancing patients' resilience is one way to increase benefit finding.",

Pituitary hormones govern many vital functions but data of standardized monitoring for deficiencies after irradiation are lacking. We prospectively assessed the latency and frequency of hypothalamo-pituitary radiation dose-effects in patients undergoing proton therapy or mixed photon /proton beams for CNS, skull base and head and neck tumors. Radiation oncologists prospectively were asked to monitor endocrine functions based on a standardized protocol complying with international recommendations at 6, 12 months and yearly during follow-up. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics were collected. Seventy patients (women 70%, median age 60.1 years) had undergone endocrine monitoring with a median follow-up of 20.7 (12.8-29.5) months. Thirty percent of patients had at least one pituitary deficiency before radiotherapy. Median mean dose to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus were respectively 52.0 (50.4-53.9) Gy and 24.7 (16.8-39.2) Gy. Of these patients with heavily exposed on their pituitary gland, skull base meningiomas (47.1%) and pituitary adenomas were the most represented (28.7%). Twenty-six (37.1%) patients experienced a new pituitary deficiency after a median time of 14.1 [IQR 10.3-23.6] months. Lactotroph and gonadotroph axis deficiencies occurred in 36% and 23.2% of the patients after 13.5 and 24.5 months, respectively. GH deficiency occurred in 9.7% patients after 27.1 months. TSH and ACTH axes occurred in 7.8% and 6.3% of patients after 21.8 and 19.0 months. On univariate analysis, only BMI < 25 was significantly associated with a shorter time to new deficiency onset. In this selected population of patients receiving over 50 Gy RBE to the pituitary gland, patients frequently developed at least one new pituitary deficiency within 2 years. As hormonal deficiencies are frequent after surgery and radiotherapy have functional and quality-of-life consequences and can be substituted medically, baseline and routine annual monitoring of every axis were performed. Educational programs for patients and physicians toward more systematic monitoring in patients, including those receiving < 30 Gy could serve to analyze radiation dose-effects and better predict individual endocrine normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP).",

However, the role of immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) in predicting both therapy responses is still unclear. ORIENT-16 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial, and enrolled 650 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic G/GEJ cancer between January 3, 2019, and August 5, 2020. For patients enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, we analyzed progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival (OS) based on PD-L1 expression and landmark analysis, and developed a multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) assay for CD4, CD8, PD-L1, CD68 and FoxP3 coupled with digital image analysis and machine learning to assess prognostic survival associations of immune cells. A total of 54 eligible patients were enrolled in this study, 35 received sintilimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy and 19 received placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy. For patients with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) < 10, survival disparities between anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy emerged 300 days post-treatment. High PD-L1 expression correlated with longer survival in anti-PD-1 therapy but less benefit in platinum-based chemotherapy. The mIF analysis also demonstrated significantly higher stromal PD-L1 density in immunotherapy responders, but tended to be lower in chemotherapy responders. Besides, high tumor stromal CD8 expression could be used as a positive biomarker in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and high tumor stromal CD4 expression was found associated with worse prognosis in platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased PD-L1 expression was associated with an increased effect on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and reduced benefit from chemotherapy. The signature of TME immune cells has the potential to predict the response of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy in G/GEJ cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03745170.",

This cross-sectional study assessed depression, anxiety, and stress in BC patients in Mazandaran, Iran, using the DASS-21 questionnaire, which showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.83-0.90). Data were collected via phone interviews and web-based surveys, and analyzed using SPSS software version 27. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic determinants were evaluated via logistic regression. This study included 283 BC patients, predominantly aged 40-44 (34.3%), married (95.4%), unemployed (73.9%), and urban residents (76.7%). Most patients received chemotherapy (94.3%), with 30.4% at Stage 1 and 43.1% Grade 2 tumors. Depression, anxiety, and stress prevalence were high (46.6%, 56.9%, and 51.9%, respectively).

To address this, we developed a Cascade Amplification of Therapeutic Payloads (CATP) system, leveraging lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to co-deliver self-amplifying mRNA (SamRNA) and modified mRNA encoding alphavirus capsids and envelopes. The CATP system initiates a dual-amplification process: SamRNA amplifies therapeutic payloads within transfected cells, while capsid and envelope proteins package SamRNA into defective viral particles to infect neighboring cells, enabling secondary payload amplification. This single-cycle infection ensures enhanced efficacy while maintaining safety. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the CATP system's superiority over conventional SamRNA delivery. In a B16F10 melanoma model, CATP achieved a 525-fold increase in intratumoral IL-12 levels, resulting in tumor regression and long-term immune memory. The platform also showed broad applicability, effectively treating MC38 colorectal cancer, CT26 colon cancer, and P53<sup>null</sup> Kras<sup>G12D</sup> pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, optimization of therapeutic payloads with mutant IL-18 further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

A. Juss., and Helianthus annuus L. All samples had consistent face-centered cubic structures, as proven by X-ray diffraction. However, electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectra showed that the green-synthesized particles had tighter size distributions and unique surface functions due to the presence of plant phytochemicals. According to in vitro tests, Codiaeum variegatum mediated nanoparticles showed the strongest multifunctional bioactivity, including increased scavenging of free radicals, targeted cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells, and substantial inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and important enzymes that hydrolyze carbohydrates. Antibacterial tests demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus was efficiently reduced by both chemically produced and Codiaeum variegatum derived nanoparticles, whereas biofilm experiments shown that Medicago sativa derived nanoparticles caused greater disruption. These findings demonstrate that the performance of nanoparticles is controlled by their botanical source, allowing NiO nanoparticles to be tailored for specific medicinal uses.

Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the microbiome of tumor tissues, adjacent normal tissues, lymph nodes, and oral rinses from 108 LSCC patients, including 36 with (LN+) and 72 without (LN-) cervical LN metastasis. Microbial functional potential was predicted using PICRUSt2. Based on repeated stratified 3 cross-validation, random forest models were used to identify metastasis-associated genera. Significant microbial differences were observed between LN + and LN- tumor tissues, with Ralstonia enriched in LN + tumors and Fusobacterium more abundant in LN- cases. All genera detected in lymph nodes were also found in tumor tissues. Functional predictions revealed enrichment of lipid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and cell wall synthesis pathways in LN + patients, particularly in tumor and oral rinse samples, with low intra-group variability. Classifiers based on tumor, lymph node, and oral microbiota demonstrated the ability to distinguish LN + from LN- patients. The lymph node-derived classifier achieved an accuracy of 84.31% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.76% - 86.85%), followed by the tumor-based model (AUC = 84.11%, 95% CI: 81.75% - 86.46%) and oral rinse classifier (AUC = 79.88%, 95% CI: 77.09% - 83.11%).

Our results demonstrated that TMC5 was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell lines, which was associated with poor prognosis and various clinical characteristics. We observed that the mutation rates of TMC5 in GC were low, and its methylation status was inversely related to its expression levels. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that TMC5 promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

Cisplatin, a highly effective and widely utilized anticancer drug, is particularly effective against solid tumors and serves as a cornerstone of adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer. Despite continuous optimization of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of cisplatin resistance frequently results in treatment failure, significantly limiting its clinical utility and therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, researchers have extensively investigated the biological mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance, including impaired DNA repair pathways and inhibition of apoptosis. Among these mechanisms, epigenetic regulation-encompassing DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regulation-has emerged as a critical factor in mediating cisplatin resistance by modulating gene expression and signaling pathways.

The clinical variables were retrospectively analyzed to establish a scoring system for evaluating preoperative nutrition-inflammation status. In the training cohort, the independent factors for MCS were identified through univariate and multivariate Logistics regression analysis. The predictive model was drawn with a nomogram, which was verified in the two validation cohorts by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and decision curve analyses (DCA). 359 and 145 eligible patients were included in the internal and external cohorts, respectively, including 47 and 30 patients suffering MCS in their respective cohorts. Old age, overweight, colostomy, end stoma, and peripheral blood markers were associated with MCS. The ROC curve showed that the nutrition-inflammation score (NIS) composed of GLR, SII and PNI predicted the differentiation of MCS well, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.752.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is an aggressive, malignant primary brain tumour and the most prevalent histological type of glioma. Our study attempted to investigate the independent predictors of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in Asian patients with glioblastoma and establish predictive models for the OS and CSS of Asian patients with glioblastoma based on the machine learning algorithms. Data from Asian patients with glioblastoma in the SEER database were retrieved and stochastically grouped into a training set (n = 845) and a validation set (n = 362), and patients in our centre were assigned to the test set (n = 172). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic factors. Predictive models for OS and CSS were established based on eight machine learning algorithms, including Lasso Cox, random survival forest, CoxBoost, generalized boosted regression modelling (GBM), stepwise Cox and survival support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, supervised principal component and partial least squares regression for Cox, and the selected predictive models were evaluated by the area under the ROC curves (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI), calibration curves and decision curve analyses in the training set, validation set and test set. In our retrospective study, age, tumour history, histologic type, surgery and chemotherapy were confirmed to be predictors of OS (p < 0.05); age, tumour history, histologic type, surgery and chemotherapy were identified as independent factors for CSS (p < 0.05). The predictive model for OS based on the GBM algorithm exhibited excellent predictive performance at 6 months (AUC = 0.837, 95% CI: 0.803-0.870), 12 months (AUC = 0.809, 95% CI: 0.780-0.839) and 24 months (AUC = 0.750, 95% CI: 0.717-0.783) in the training set, and the powerful predictive performance of the GBM model was confirmed in the validation and test sets, with good concordance between the predicted and observed OS rates demonstrated by calibration curves and clinical decision making performance suggested by the decision curve analyses curves. The predictive model based on the GBM algorithm for CSS also performed best = in the training set at 6 months (AUC = 0.808, 95% CI: 0.770-0.847), 12 months (AUC = 0.755, 95% CI: 0.721-0.789) and 24 months (AUC = 0.692, 95% CI: 0.657-0.728) in the training set, and convincing predictive effectiveness was also confirmed in the validation and test sets with good calibration and clinical utility. Age, tumour history, histologic type, surgery and chemotherapy were confirmed to be independent factors for OS; and age, tumour history, histologic type, surgery and chemotherapy were identified as prognostic factors for CSS in our retrospective study. The predictive model constructed for OS and CSS based on the GBM algorithm in Asian patients with glioblastoma can be used to accurately predict OS and CSS in clinical practice, which may help tailor personalized treatment regimens and provide significant benefits for these patients.",

    "title": "Dual roles and therapeutic targeting of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor microenvironments.",
    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.",

Likewise, it has been suggested that the intra-tumoral microbiome may be associated with specific features of cancer such as tumour progression and metastasis. However, additional research is needed to validate these findings in diverse populations. In this study, we characterized the intra-tumoral microbiota of 883 Malaysian breast cancer patients using transcriptomic data from bulk tumours and investigated their association with clinical variables and immune scores. We found that the tumour microbiome was not associated with breast cancer molecular subtype, cancer stage, tumour grade, or patient age, but was weakly associated with immune scores. We also found that the tumour microbiome was associated with immune scores in our cohort using random forest models, suggesting the possibility of an interaction between the tumour microbiome and the tumour immune microenvironment in Asian breast cancer.",

    "title": "Smart IoT with the hybrid evolutionary method and image processing for tumor detection.",
    "abstract": "The primary objective of modern healthcare systems is to enhance public health by providing efficient, reliable, and well-structured solutions. Improving patient satisfaction through tailored medical services has driven rapid advancements in healthcare, leading to increased competition and system complexity. However, the expansion of healthcare services introduces challenges such as high data volume, latency, response time constraints, and security vulnerabilities. To address these issues, fog computing offers an effective solution by processing data closer to end devices, reducing latency, and enabling real-time responses. This research proposes a robust brain tumor detection framework within a fog-based smart healthcare infrastructure. The process begins with data placement leveraging an improved evolutionary technique for Image Processing (HETS-IP) to optimize fog node placement based on key parameters such as energy efficiency and latency. Specifically, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is enhanced with a direct binary encoding technique, in which solutions are represented as binary strings, making it suitable for problems where decisions are discrete. This approach allows efficient optimization in binary decision spaces and improves adaptability for complex placement problems. Once data placement is committed, the tumor detection framework is performed directly at fog nodes to enhance real-time processing. This phase will begin with preprocessing, where a bilateral filter is applied to reduce noise while preserving critical edge details. Next, feature extraction is utilized to derive statistical texture features, which capture diagnostic information essential for distinguishing between tumor types. The process continues by classification using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with sequential architecture to classify tumors. Simulation results demonstrate that HETS-IP outperforms traditional evolutionary algorithms, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing (GASA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). On average, HETS-IP reduces energy consumption by 5%, 9%, and 14% and decreases makespan by 4%, 6%, and 11%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 97% and a precision of 96%, ensuring highly reliable brain tumor detection.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular communication signals in the tumor microenvironment are closely related to behaviors such as cancer cell proliferation and immune evasion. However, the specific roles of intercellular signaling pathways in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data derived from paired samples of two intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) tissues and two adjacent normal tissues, thoroughly examining their cellular composition. InferCNV analysis was employed to compare tumor cells and normal cells, and pseudotime analysis was used to identify the growth and differentiation trajectories of the cells. Additionally, intercellular communication analysis was conducted to elucidate the communication networks between cells. Our analysis delineated the cellular ecosystem of ICC, identifying cell subclusters with shared characteristics between ICC and normal tissues. Notably, we characterized a distinct C7-E-T subcluster that exhibited high expression of CXCR4 and BPTF, markers associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Further investigation revealed that the MIF intercellular signaling pathway promotes the progression of ICC by activating intracellular signals in the MYC pathway. This study highlights the dysregulation of intercellular signaling pathways within tumor clusters, which influences the onset and progression of ICC. The cancer stem cell subpopulation (CXCR4<sup>hi</sup>BPTF<sup>hi</sup>E-T) exerts a significant influence on ICC progression by secreting relevant signaling molecules via the MIF signaling pathway.",

Regression models like quadratic, cubic, and random forest are employed to predict response metrics including like boiling point, refractivity, and surface area of the drugs. Comparative studies indicate that quadratic models provide better predictive performance then their cubic counterparts in most scenarios.

This study focused on isolating and characterizing L-GLS-producing marine bacteria from Mediterranean seawater for preliminary therapeutic evaluation. Halomonas aquamarina HBIM1 was identified as the most efficient isolate through comprehensive phenotypic, genotypic, and enzymatic screening. The enzyme was successfully purified, achieving a specific activity of 748.35 U/mg with 3.39-fold purification. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed high purity with a single 66 kDa protein band. Kinetic characterization revealed optimal activity at pH 8 and 50 °C, with strong substrate affinity (Km = 0.198 mM⁻¹). Preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity screening demonstrated selective antiproliferative effects on HepG2 liver cancer cells (IC50 = 33.98 µg/ml) compared to normal WI-38 cells (IC50 = 93.43 µg/ml), yielding a 2.75-fold selectivity index. Molecular docking analysis identified tannic acid and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine as selective inhibitors of bacterial L-GLS, with tannic acid showing the highest binding affinity (-12.25 kcal/mol) and 5-fold selectivity over human L-GLS, suggesting potential for combination therapy strategies. These proof-of-concept findings indicate the preliminary anticancer potential of Halomonas-derived L-GLS and computational support for selective inhibitor development.

    "abstract": "While cancer has traditionally been considered a genetic disease, mounting evidence indicates an important role for non-genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms. Common anti-cancer drugs have recently been observed to induce the adoption of non-genetic drug-tolerant cell states, thereby accelerating the evolution of drug resistance. This confounds conventional high-dose treatment strategies aimed at maximal tumor reduction, since high doses can simultaneously promote non-genetic resistance. In this work, we study optimal dosing of anti-cancer treatment under drug-induced cell plasticity. We show that the optimal dosing strategy steers the tumor to a fixed equilibrium composition between sensitive and tolerant cells, while precisely balancing the trade-off between cell kill and tolerance induction. The optimal equilibrium strategy ranges from applying a low dose continuously to applying the maximum dose intermittently, depending on the dynamics of tolerance induction. We finally discuss how our approach can be integrated with in vitro data to derive patient-specific treatment insights.",

The natural component baicalin can effectively inhibit the growth and metastasis of TNBC; however, it has some limitations, such as poor targeting and side effects. Nano targeted delivery systems can improve drug efficacy by enhancing drug accumulation and controlling drug release. Trop-2 transmembrane glycoprotein expression is high in TNBC cells, suggesting that it can serve as a specific active targeting molecular-modified nano drug delivery system for TNBC to overcome non-specific distribution. Based on the characteristics of high-concentration glutathione in the tumor microenvironment, redox-sensitive nano-prodrugs (Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP) have been designed to achieve intelligent slow control and release of drugs. The chemical structure of the Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP, and its stability, reductive response to drug release behavior, and targeting ability in vitro were characterized. Cell experiments and a transplanted tumor model verified the anti-tumor effect and biosafety. Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP was stable in a physiological environment and rapidly released the drug under reducing conditions. The experiments showed that Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP significantly promoted cellular uptake, and drug accumulation and maintenance time at the tumor site were increased. It enhanced the inhibitory effect on metastasis in vivo and in vitro, and no obvious toxicity or side effects were observed. Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP was successfully constructed. The targeting ability, microenvironment responsiveness, and anti-tumor metastatic effects of Trop2-BA-ss-PPEP provide a new strategy for TNBC therapy, which has good application and transformation potential.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis generates reproductive cells with a reduced genome complement, with most species using homologous recombination to promote accurate meiotic chromosome segregation and to generate genetic diversity among offspring.

DSB resection in nonmeiotic contexts has been extensively studied, but meiotic resection is less well understood. We provide here a review of studies elucidating the mechanism and regulation of resection during meiosis, covering similarities and differences from resection in mitotically dividing cells. The nucleases that carry out resection are discussed, along with resection-modulating factors such as DNA damage signaling and chromatin structure.

    "abstract": "Sevoflurane, a widely used clinical anesthetic, exhibits neuroproctive properties though its precise mechanisms remain unclear. Astrocytes, a critical regulators of immune responses, actively participate in sevoflurane-mediated neuroprotection against ischemia. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a key molecule for conversion from pro-inflammatory astrocytes to anti-inflammatory astrocytes phenotypes. The present study explores the role of astrocytic TLR4 in sevoflurane preconditioning mediated neuroprotection after focal cerebral ischemia. In vivo, mice were preconditioned with 2.0 % sevoflurane before right middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). In vitro, primary astrocytes were pretreated with sevoflurane and followed by 4 h oxygen-glucose deprivation for astrocytes and 2 h for astrocyte-neuron cocultures. Astrocytic TLR4 expression and its role in sevoflurane preconditioning in cerebral ischemia were assessed using western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. The expression of TLR4 and the levels of inflammatory cytokines both within the penumbra and in primary astrocytes significantly increased following ischemia, further exacerbating neural damage. In vivo, sevoflurane preconditioning reduced the expression of TLR4 as well as the levels of TNFα and IL-6. Consistently, it improved neurological deficit scores and decreased infarct volume. In vitro, sevoflurane preconditioning prevented the increasing of TLR4 as well as the levels of TNFα and IL-6 of primary astrocytes and decreased the over-expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and primary neuron apoptosis in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures. Our findings demonstrate that sevoflurane preconditioning attenuates ischemia-mediated neuroinflammation by suppressing astrocytic TLR4 expression, highlighting its therapeutic potential against neuroinflammation induced by focal cerebral ischemia.",

It requires significant resources, building facilities takes time, and planning of the capacity is essential to offer RT to all patients in need. There have been considerable advances in lung cancer management, especially medical treatment, and survival the last decades, which might impact the need for RT. In this study, we investigated whether the RT use for lung cancer has changed in Norway since year 2000. Data on patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 2000 and 2020 were collected from the Cancer Registry of Norway, containing nearly complete RT and survival data. 55,048 patients were analyzed. Median age was 71 years, 44 % were women, 74 % had non-small-cell lung cancer, 16 % small-cell lung cancer, 10 % unknown histology, 46 % metastatic disease. Overall, 50 % received any RT.

Their high prevalence, chronic nature, and potential aggressiveness often lead to metastasis, systemic disease, and death despite the use of conventional treatment based on surgery and chemotherapy. There is a need for complementary, accessible, and low-cost therapies to improve the perioperative care of these canine patients. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ozonated autohemotherapy as an integrative therapy by analyzing markers of oxidative balance, clinical-laboratory parameters, and quality of life of dogs with CMT. Forty-nine dogs were examined and allocated into study groups: dogs treated with only mastectomy (GM; n = 11), mastectomy with ozonated autohemotherapy (GM-AHmO<sub>3</sub>; n = 13), and mastectomy with non-ozonated autohemotherapy (GM-AHm; n = 12); a fourth group contained negative control healthy dogs (GH; n = 13). Assessment of clinical, hematological (erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, urea, creatinine, ALT, ALP), oxidative markers (TAC and MDA), and quality-of-life was performed at five-day points, D0, D1, D2, D3, and D4. The GM-AHmO<sub>3</sub> showed progressive improvement in quality-of-life scores (from 26.4 to 32; p < 0.001), increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC: 13.1 to 16.1; p = 0.003), and decreased malondialdehyde levels (MDA: 438 to 150.5; p = 0.002) from D0 to D4.

This retrospective study enrolled 415 patients with HCC from two centers who underwent multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and percutaneous thermal ablation. Patients in Institution 1 (n = 315) were randomly assigned to the training cohorts (n = 220) and internal tests (n = 95), while 100 patients in Institution 2 formed the external validation cohort. Delta radiomic features were extracted by comparing contrast-enhanced phases with noncontract images, followed by variance filtering, correlation analysis, random forest ranking, and Cox regression to derive the DRS. The DRS was combined with clinical characteristics, including tumor burden score (TBS), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and China Liver Cancer Staging (CNLC), to build Random Survival Forest (RSF) models. The performance of the model was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), the area under the curve (AUC), the calibration curves and the analysis of decision curves (DCA). The RSF models that integrate DRS with clinical characteristics demonstrated favorable predictive performance for both OS and RFS. For OS predictions at 36 and 60 months, AUCs ranged from 0.71 to 0.83 in cohorts, with corresponding C indices between 0.69 and 0.83. For the prediction of short-term RFS at 6, 12, and 24 months, the AUC ranged from 0.71 to 0.91, with C-indices between 0.68 and 0.71. Calibration and DCA analysis confirmed the robustness and clinical utility of the models in internal and external validations. Delta radiomics derived from multiphase MRI effectively captured tumor dynamics and heterogeneity. When integrated with clinical characteristics, the resulting models allowed an accurate prediction of both recurrence and long-term survival, providing a practical tool for risk stratification and individualized post-ablation management in HCC.",

The identified factors were chemoradiotherapy (OR = 2.52, 95 % CI: 1.86-3.43), smoking (OR = 2.02, 95 % CI: 1.12-3.65), high pre-treatment BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (OR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.17), and high performance status (OR: 0.49, 95 % CI: 0.34-0.72). CWL is a common problem in HNC patients during radiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy, smoking, higher pretreatment BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and lower performance status may increase the risk of CWL. Healthcare professionals should identify risk factors for CWL to enable precision interventions and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Surgery remains the main procedure for treating cancer and can result in profound and long-term effects that can impact psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the lived experience of people living with cancer and how surgery may have affected their mental well-being. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach informed the research study conducted between March-October 2023. The theory of the Suffering Human Being underpinned this study. Three phases were undertaken (1) co-production of an interview schedule in partnership between researchers and community charity (2) semi-structured interviews (3) collaborative mural design which involved working with a local artist to design and produce a mural in the local community. Thematic analysis of data was performed. Individual interviews were conducted with 14 participants who had previously undergone surgery for cancer (of more than 2 years). Three main themes were identified: perceived loss of personhood and worth, endurance of suffering and becoming fearless and renewal of self, relationships and life perspective. A mural visually representing these key ideas, symbolised through the careful selection of images and design, was completed. Participants identified that the experience of surgery for treatment resulted in a feeling of loss of themselves. This lead to a period of 'endurance' in which the extent of their feelings were concealed from others yet a 'new' transformed self emerged from their suffering. This was artistically reflected in the developed urban mural, inspired by the Japanese art of Kintsugi, to depict a broken but reformed vase illustrating the 'beauty in broken things.'",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer patients undergoing 3D external beam radiotherapy plus brachytherapy face significant physical and psychological burdens. This study aimed to explore their experiences across the treatment journey to improve care. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation with 20 Chinese cervical cancer radiotherapy patients gathered data on psychological, behavioral, social support, and needs aspects. Thematic analysis informed the creation of user personas and journey maps. Clinical applicability and accuracy were assessed via questionnaires completed by 60 patients. Patients exhibited substantial physical, psychological, and social needs throughout treatment, with variations across groups and stages. Four distinct treatment stages were defined: initial intervention, external beam radiotherapy, 3D brachytherapy, and long-term follow-up, each with stage-specific and cross-journey needs. Five typical patient profiles were identified and mapped to stage-specific needs. Questionnaire validation confirmed the profiles effectively captured patients' emotional fluctuations and evolving needs across stages. Combining user personas and journey mapping successfully depicted cervical cancer radiotherapy patients' needs and emotional changes across treatment phases, validated for clinical use. This framework provides a basis for personalized interventions to optimize patient experience and outcomes.",

This review examines how SDoH impact positive psychological outcomes, using the Healthy People 2030 framework. A mixed methods systematic review was conducted, and the findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed across PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and RISS to identify studies exploring the relationship between SDoH and positive psychological outcomes among AYA CCS. A convergent, integrated approach was used for data synthesis. Fifteen studies (12 quantitative and 3 qualitative) were included. The most frequently addressed SDoH domain was social and community context. Support from family, peers, institutions, and cultural or faith-based communities was consistently associated with outcomes such as post-traumatic growth, resilience, and well-being. Trusting relationships with healthcare providers were also identified as important. No study addressed neighborhood or built environment factors. Positive psychological outcomes in AYA CCS are strongly influenced by interpersonal, institutional, and cultural support systems. While family support remains critical, broader supports such as healthcare access, education, and employment are essential for autonomy and well-being. Cultural and spiritual factors also serve as key resources for meaning-making. Future research should comprehensively examine SDoH to inform equitable and developmentally appropriate psychosocial interventions for this population.",

Dietary intake is one factor that affects both physical and psychological CRC symptom management; however, notable inequities in CRC symptom experiences exist due to social determinants of health (SDOH). This study aimed to explore the challenges and adaptative behaviors related to dietary management and treatment-related symptom experiences among patients with CRC undergoing chemotherapy, with a particular focus on the influence of SDOH. Eighteen participants, representing diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, with a diagnosis of CRC who had received chemotherapy within the past three months were included in the study. One-time, semi-structured interviews were conducted via video call, and the data were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. Six primary themes were identified: (1) the multidimensional impact of cancer treatment, (2) overcoming SDOH barriers along the cancer continuum, (3) adaptation to new dietary needs, (4) use of proactive self-management strategies and cultural resilience to overcome cancer, (5) multifaceted support systems that enhance cancer care, and (6) nurturing positivity and hope. These findings highlight complex and interconnected factors that shape the treatment-related symptoms and dietary challenges of patients with CRC undergoing chemotherapy. Understanding of these influences can inform targeted interventions and ongoing support systems to enhance quality of life and optimize care for cancer survivors.",

However, a comprehensive understanding of the major problems parents encounter and how they address these problems remains limited. This study aimed to explore parental problem-solving experiences during their children's cancer treatment processes. A descriptive phenomenological study was conducted at three tertiary hospitals in mainland China. A sample of 35 informants was recruited, comprising 22 parents who participated in individual interviews and a focus group interview that included eight additional parents and five healthcare providers. Data were analyzed based on Colaizzi's descriptive analysis framework. Three overarching themes were identified. First, \"The burden of caregiving is suffocating me\" captured parents' overwhelming experiences of caregiving, characterized by emotional distress, physical exhaustion, social isolation, and the need to constantly manage complex medical challenges, children's psychological changes, and ongoing uncertainty about the future. Second, \"Our entire family's routine has been disrupted\" described role strain, marital tension, and financial pressures that reverberated throughout the household. Third, \"Three choices to cope with problems\" portrayed the distinct styles parents adopt when solving problems: \"positivity and rationality,\" \"passivity and avoidance,\" and \"impulsivity and carelessness.\" This study provides valuable insights into the multiple and intensive challenges parents face and their various problem-solving styles during the problem-solving journey. These findings can aid healthcare providers in designing targeted interventions to enhance their problem-solving skills. The implementation of problem-solving skills training is recommended to assist parents in managing challenges effectively and overcoming dysfunctional problem-solving styles.",

This study employed a multicenter cross-sectional research design with a sample of 252 dyads of breast cancer couples hospitalized in five tertiary hospitals in China from May-November 2023. The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Dyadic Coping Inventory, Chinese Family Resilience Assessment and Chinese Family Function Scale were used to conduct the survey, and the Actor‒Partner Interdependence Mediation Model was applied. The results revealed significant actor effects; specifically, patients' and spouses' dyadic appraisals influenced their own coping behaviors via family resilience/function. Notably asymmetric partner effects emerged: spouses' family resilience/function mediated the spouse appraisal→patient coping pathway, but not vice versa. Both family resilience and family function showed significant mediation. The findings confirmed that dyadic appraisal influences couples' ability to cope through family resources, demanding role-contextualized refinements to dyadic models. Interventions targeting family resilience and function may improve couples' adaptive outcomes during breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the experiences of patients with advanced cancer undergoing palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases, focusing on their physical and emotional responses and coping strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of patients' lived experiences. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, followed by inductive content analysis, in which each interview was individually coded. The resulting codes were analysed to identify overarching themes. Sixteen patients with advanced cancer (10 men and 6 women) shared their experiences with palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. Four key themes emerged, highlighting significant physical and psychological distress as well as emotional instability regarding treatment outcomes and post-radiotherapy life. However, many patients positively drew on their inner strength and coped with their circumstances. While palliative radiotherapy is a minimally invasive intervention intended to alleviate distress, patients often face unique physical and psychological challenges associated with short-term palliative treatment. These findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to palliative radiotherapy, in which healthcare professionals not only provide treatment but also address psychological distress and support patients' coping mechanisms. Nurses play a central role in integrating person-centred care into palliative radiotherapy, working collaboratively with interdisciplinary teams to enhance the treatment experience for patients.",

A strong clinical governance climate fosters accountability, ethical decision-making, and continuous improvement, yet its role in oncology nursing remains underexplored. Additionally, the impact of digital health competence in strengthening the clinical governance-patient-centered care relationship is unclear. This study examines how clinical governance influences patient-centered care competency and whether digital health competence enhances this relationship. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 600 oncology nurses from five hospitals in Egypt. After excluding outliers, 592 responses were retained for analysis. Data were collected using validated questionnaires measuring clinical governance climate, digital health competence, and patient-centered care. Multivariate regression and moderation analysis were performed to examine associations between these variables. The mean score for clinical governance climate was 2.74 ± 0.41, digital health competence was 2.63 ± 0.83, and patient-centered care was 2.70 ± 0.42. Clinical governance climate was positively associated with patient-centered care (B = 0.362, p < 0.01), and digital health competence independently improved patient-centered care (B = 0.191, p < 0.01). The interaction effect (B = 0.241, p = 0.01) confirmed that digital health competence strengthened the positive association between clinical governance and patient-centered care. This study highlights the triad of excellence in oncology nursing-clinical governance climate, digital health competence, and patient-centered care. Integrating these elements ensures safe, efficient, and compassionate cancer care. Strengthening governance and digital proficiency optimizes patient outcomes, setting a benchmark for excellence in oncology nursing within the digital age.",

Data were obtained from a descriptive, longitudinal IRB-approved study investigating the biology of CRF in men with prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy. Data were included from 68 participant medical records, self-report questionnaires, and blood samples. Multidimensional CRF was assessed using the MFSI-SF questionnaire. Data were collected at: baseline (T1), completion of radiation therapy (T2), 6 months (T3) and 24 months (T4) after completion of radiation therapy. Spearman Rank correlations between MFSI-SF subscale scores and patient reported outcomes and biomarker values were computed for each time point. Most dimensions (general, physical, mental) of CRF worsened during treatment, with the exception of improved emotional fatigue. After treatment completion, most CRF dimensions (general, physical, mental) improved, while emotional fatigue remained steady. During treatment, co-occurring symptoms (anxiety, depression, pain, difficulty sleeping) were each observed to be associated with different CRF dimensions. After treatment completion, prostate cancer risk group, co-occurring symptoms, and IL-8 were observed to be associated with different CRF dimensions. The findings support that there may be unique correlates, including biologic correlates, for the different dimensions of CRF. Understanding the different dimensions of CRF is critical for development of tailored assessments and interventions targeted to the unique CRF dimensions to optimize management.",

A better understanding of the types of image characteristics that are most challenging to readers would support future education, as well as underpin advancements in AI modelling. This current work focuses on radiography advanced practitioners (RAP) to establish if RAPs and radiologists are challenged by the same characteristics. This was a prospective, comparison study of radiographer and radiologist mammography readings. Using a cloud-based image interpretative platform and a 5 MP display, 16 radiographers and 24 radiologists read a test set of 60 mammograms with 20 confirmed cancer cases. Difficulty indices were calculated for each group based on error rates for each mammographic case. Unpaired Mann-Whitney tests were employed to compare error rates between various image characteristics. Spearman correlation analysis was used to establish if difficulty indices were associated with each cohort. Strong correlations for cancer and normal cases difficulty indices respectively (r = 0.83 CI:0.61-0.93) and (r = 0.73; CI:0.54-0.85) were shown between both groups. Greatest difficulty scores were shown for cases with soft tissue appearances as opposed calcifications (p = 0.003) and for cases without prior images, compared to those with (p = 0.03). No significant image characteristic differences were noted for the radiologists. This early study acknowledges a strong correlation between radiologists and radiographers when determining which mammographic cases are difficult to interpret. However, radiographers appear to be more susceptible to varying cancer appearances as well as the non-availability of prior images with normal cases. The results should be helpful when tailoring educational strategies and developing augmented artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to support human readers.",

    "abstract": "Blood transfusions play a critical role in breast cancer management, particularly in addressing perioperative blood loss and chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, emerging evidence suggests that transfusions may adversely affect oncologic outcomes by inducing transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) and altering the tumor microenvironment (TME). TRIM suppresses cytotoxic immune responses, potentially facilitating tumor progression-especially in aggressive subtypes such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive cancers. Additionally, transfusions can paradoxically exacerbate tumor hypoxia by increasing blood viscosity and impairing microvascular perfusion, thereby reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. This review examines the dual role of blood transfusions in breast cancer, emphasizing both their clinical benefits and potential risks. We analyze their impact on treatment resistance and tumor progression and discuss strategies to mitigate associated risks, including leukoreduction, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), intravenous iron supplementation, and blood conservation techniques. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of personalized transfusion approaches guided by tumor subtype, immune status, and relevant biomarkers such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PD-L1 expression, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Future research should focus on optimizing transfusion timing, implementing biomarker-driven protocols, and developing immune-modulating interventions to counteract TRIM. A personalized, evidence-based transfusion strategy may ultimately enhance treatment efficacy and improve long-term outcomes in breast cancer care.",

The event aimed to enhance collaboration across the global symptom science community; identify common research interests, gaps in knowledge, and opportunities for research; and develop strategies to address challenges and accelerate symptom science research internationally. The aim of this white paper is to summarize the discussions and recommendations deliberated during the meeting and introduce the Global Research Alliance in Symptom Science (GRASS). This two-day meeting featured presentations that highlighted critical issues and unanswered questions in cancer symptom science and other chronic conditions. Attendees identified four core topic areas based on the knowledge gaps reflected throughout the presentations. Of note, the co-occurrence of cancer with other chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) that may share similar contributors and underlying mechanisms were included in broader context. Four working groups (WGs) were formed to identify gaps and opportunities associated with each topic and to outline strategic directions and essential actions to advance symptom science. The WGs developed recommendations on four core topic areas. WG1 explored optimal approaches to collect, analyze, and use symptom data for research and clinical purposes. WG2 addressed the development of a minimum dataset or common data model for symptom science research. WG3 focused on enhancement of best practices in implementation science strategies to improve uptake of evidence-based symptom management strategies in routine clinical care. WG4 addressed the questions of capacity building and infrastructure for the creation of a global alliance in symptom science (GRASS). WGs' recommendations underscore the commitment of an international coalition of scientists to advance symptom science. The symposium established the groundwork for the group to constitute GRASS, a global research alliance dedicated to symptom science in cancer and other chronic conditions. Future directions include establishing regular scientific meetings, fostering interprofessional collaboration, and engaging with symptom scientists.",

Renal CaOx crystal deposition is one of the primary initiating factors of CaOx formation; however, the critical signaling metabolites communicating along the gut-kidney axis, and their regulation on renal CaOx crystal deposition remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of gut microbiota-associated unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) metabolism in renal CaOx crystalline pathogenesis. The UCB was first distinguished as a significant risk factor of renal CaOx crystal deposition, by transplantation of fecal microbiota derived from healthy rat (healthy-FMT) to alleviate the renal CaOx crystal deposition in rat models, which was also testified in CaOx stone patients. Further experiments showed that UCB could increase renal CaOx crystal deposition significantly in both rat and Drosophila models. Mechanistically, UCB can promote apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells, enhance oxalate secretion by upregulating Slc26a6 expression, and facilitate CaOx crystal nucleation and aggregation, all of which contribute to renal CaOx crystalline pathogenesis. Furthermore, we identified significant gut microbiota dysbiosis in renal CaOx crystal deposition rats, particularly in β-glucuronidase (β-GD) and bilirubin reductase (BilR)-related dysbiosis, which modulate UCB levels and its enterohepatic circulation. These findings suggest that UCB is a novel regulator of renal CaOx crystal deposition, and targeting its metabolism via modulation of the gut microbiota may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing renal CaOx crystal deposition-related nephropathy.",

Transplantation of the microbiota from CRC and non-CRC patients into mice demonstrates that non-diseased individuals possess organisms that reduce tumor formation and highlights Bacteriodes uniformis as protective. B. uniformis is reduced in humans with CRC, and proactive treatment with B. uniformis slows tumor growth in mice. Natural killer (NK) cells, but not T cells, are required for B. uniformis-mediated protection. CRC is recalcitrant to immunotherapies; however, addition of B. uniformis restores response to α-CTLA-4 treatment in an NK cell-dependent manner. We report that high Lag-3 expression is associated with greater survival in CRC patients and that B. uniformis-mediated protection is reliant on Lag-3 in innate cells. Induction of NK cell activity and reduced tumor growth is dependent on a specific B. uniformis capsular polysaccharide.

Shelterin is composed of six proteins (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1, POT1, and RAP1) that can assemble into various subcomplexes in vitro, but their stoichiometry and dynamics in cells remain poorly understood. To quantitatively analyze shelterin function, we generated a panel of human cancer cell lines expressing HaloTagged shelterin proteins from their endogenous loci. We determined both the total and telomeric abundance of each subunit, demonstrating that shelterin proteins are present at telomeres in equal numbers. Using single-molecule live-cell imaging, we showed that TRF1-TIN2-TPP1-POT1 and TRF2-RAP1 form distinct subcomplexes that bind non-overlapping sites on telomeric chromatin. TRF1-TIN2-TPP1-POT1 tightly associates with telomeres, whereas TRF2-RAP1 binds more dynamically, facilitating the recruitment of co-factors that protect chromosome ends. Altogether, our work provides mechanistic insight into shelterin function in telomere maintenance and advances our understanding of telomeric chromatin architecture.",

    "abstract": "The YTHDF protein family plays a critical role in cancer development by recognizing and regulating the stability of N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A)-modified RNA. Here, we reveal an autophagy-dependent mechanism controlling YTHDF protein levels. Using contact inhibition as a cellular model system, we show YTHDF proteins to be rapidly degraded, coinciding with increased autophagy and decreased mTOR activity. Upon pharmacological mTOR inhibition, YTHDF2 is also downregulated via lysosomal degradation. YTHDF2 selectively interacts with the autophagy modifier GABARAP L2 through LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs in its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions. Autophagic YTHDF2 downregulation results in the co-degradation of its bound m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA clients. While YTHDF depletion induces cell death in contact-inhibition-deficient HCT116 cancer cells, contact-inhibited MRC5 and RPE1 cells remain unaffected. Our findings uncover a regulatory pathway that governs YTHDF protein stability with significant implications for cancer biology and cell fate determination and suggest the existence of an autophagy-mediated degradation pathway for m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA.",

    "abstract": "In heterogeneous tumors, adjacent CpG sites form methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs), genomic regions where methylation status reflects local epigenetic concordance. While MHBs have been implicated in gene dysregulation, their pan-cancer dynamics and clinical relevance remain unclear. We profiled 110 primary tumors across 11 common solid cancer types, identifying 81,567 MHBs. These MHBs exhibit high cancer-type specificity, with enrichment in regulatory elements. Integrative bulk and single-cell analyses reveal that MHBs associate with gene expression independently of mean methylation changes. Moreover, pan-cancer prioritization of MHB-associated differentially expressed genes highlights their roles in oncogenic pathways such as the G2/M checkpoint, MYC targets, and E2F signaling. Inter-tumor heterogeneity links MHB discordance to driver mutations and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that MHBs serve as effective biomarkers for cancer detection, performing competitively to existing methods. This resource positions MHBs as multimodal epigenetic regulators, bridging tumor heterogeneity, transcriptional control, and liquid biopsy diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Human N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) catalyze N-terminal protein N-myristoylation and are promising targets in cancer, with an emerging mechanistic rationale for targeted therapy. Here, we screened 245 cancer cell lines against IMP-1320, a potent NMT inhibitor (NMTi), and conducted pathway-level analyses to identify that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to NMTis. Proteomics on detergent-enriched membrane fractions in MYC or MYCN-deregulated cancer cell models revealed that cell death is associated at least in part with loss of membrane association of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. This is concurrent with loss of myristoylation and degradation of the complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4, and induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by MYC or MYCN-deregulation. NMTis eliminated or suppressed MYC- and MYCN-driven tumors in vivo without overt toxicity, suggesting that this constitutive co-translational protein modification can be targeted in MYC-driven cancers.",

We also integrated liCHi-C data with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to identify functional implications. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of exposure to environmental enrichment (EE). Remarkably, our results demonstrate an age-dependent modulation of promoter interactions and expression with EE, with aging-like changes induced in young mice upon EE, likely associated with brain maturation, while age-related alterations were reverted in old mice, leading to a partial rejuvenation of aged mouse hippocampi. These findings reveal a dynamic behavior of the neuronal 3D chromatin structure over time, which can be modulated by external interventions.",

    "abstract": "In the UNIRAD phase III trial, evening intake of tamoxifen was previously associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS), while no timing effect was observed for aromatase inhibitors. This sub-study evaluated whether the timing of everolimus intake affects DFS in patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET). A total of 1278 patients with high-risk HR+/HER2- early breast cancer were randomized to receive adjuvant ET with either placebo or everolimus. Patients prospectively recorded the timing of both ET and everolimus intake using four time slots: morning (06:00-11:59), afternoon (12:00-17:59), evening (18:00-23:59), and night (00:00-05:59). The relationship between intake timing and DFS was a pre-specified secondary endpoint. Timing data were available for 513 of 632 patients (81.2%) in the everolimus arm. After a median follow-up of 60.6 months, 15 local relapses, 55 metastases, and 36 deaths were reported. Overall, everolimus timing had no significant association with DFS (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.53-1.35, P = 0.4). However, a significant interaction was found between everolimus timing and ET type (P = 0.001). Among tamoxifen users, evening/night intake of everolimus significantly improved DFS compared to morning/afternoon intake (HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.59, P = 0.005), independently of tamoxifen timing. No timing effect was observed in patients on aromatase inhibitors (HR = 1.56, P = 0.1). In multivariate analysis, evening/night everolimus with tamoxifen remained an independent predictor of improved DFS (HR = 0.13, P = 0.002). Evening or nighttime intake of everolimus may enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen-based adjuvant therapy in high-risk HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is a pathogenic bacterium associated with the development of gastric cancer and other gastric disorders. One of its major virulence factors, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), plays a crucial role in maintaining bacterial integrity, mediating host adhesion, and modulating the immune response. Recent studies have indicated that ADP-heptose, an intermediate in the heptose biosynthetic pathway involved in the LPS synthesis cascade, is a novel pathogen-associated molecular pattern for <i>H. pylori</i>. This study focuses on the <i>HP0858</i> gene, which is predicted to encode RfaE/HldE, an enzyme with kinase and ADP-transferase activities essential for heptose production. An <i>HP0858</i> gene-disrupted mutant was first generated, and the resulting mutant exhibited a truncated LPS structure, confirming its role in LPS biosynthesis. The <i>HP0858</i>-deficient mutant displayed increased sensitivity to the detergent SDS and the antibiotic novobiocin, heightened surface hydrophobicity, and a propensity for autoaggregation. Additionally, the mutant exhibited reduced adhesion and internalization capabilities, a diminished elongation phenotype, and failed to induce IL-8 secretion in infected gastric AGS cells. In an <i>in vivo Galleria mellonella</i> infection model, the <i>HP0858</i> knockout mutant showed significantly attenuated virulence, as no bacterial load was detectable in the larvae's hemolymph 48 h post-infection, unlike the wild-type strain. Finally, we provided evidence that the enzyme encoded by <i>HP0858</i> is involved in a general protein glycosylation system linked to LPS biosynthesis, specifically glycosylating the adhesin AlpA. These findings highlight the essential role of RfaE/HldE/HP0858 in LPS biosynthesis and bacterial virulence, making it a promising target for future therapeutic interventions against <i>H. pylori</i> infections.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence restrains the expansion of neoplastic cells through several layers of regulation. We report that the histone H3-specific demethylase KDM4 is expressed as human stromal cells undergo senescence. In clinical oncology, upregulated KDM4 and diminished H3K9/H3K36 methylation correlate with poorer survival of patients with prostate cancer after chemotherapy. Global chromatin accessibility mapping via assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, and expression profiling through RNA sequencing, reveals global changes of chromatin openness and spatiotemporal reprogramming of the transcriptomic landscape, which underlie the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Selective targeting of KDM4 dampens the SASP of senescent stromal cells, promotes cancer cell apoptosis in the treatment-damaged tumor microenvironment, and prolongs survival of experimental animals. Our study supports dynamic changes of H3K9/H3K36 methylation during senescence, identifies an unusually permissive chromatin state, and unmasks KDM4 as a key SASP modulator. KDM4 targeting presents a new therapeutic avenue to manipulate cellular senescence and limit its contribution to age-related pathologies, including cancer.",

Yet, the mechanisms regulating CAR T-cell function as well as the side effects remain an area of active research. The formation of the immunological synapse is essential for the activation of signaling pathways including the Ca2+-dependent one. Here we demonstrated the functional role of Kv1.3 channels in a CAR T-cell model. Our findings highlight the colocalization of Kv1.3 channel with CAR and its redistribution into the synapse between a CAR T and target cell. The biophysical properties of Kv1.3 channel are not vastly affected by the introduction of CAR in the cells. The blockage of this ion channel's lateral movement affects the killing potential of CAR T cells, likely via disruption of the Ca2+ response upon IS formation. Overall, these data suggest that the manipulation of the Kv1.3 channel may contribute to the improvement of CAR T-cell immunotherapy and provide new insights for future clinical strategies.",

The existing literature has predominantly focused on liver metastases originating from colorectal carcinomas, and to date, only two studies have investigated histopathological growth patterns in consecutively collected patient cohorts. Our aim was to study the histopathological growth patterns of all patients with liver metastases between 2011 and 2016 in a consecutive manner. Clinicopathological features were extracted from the medical records of the cases included in the study period. Histological slides of the metastases were evaluated by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist. Statistical analyses were carried out by using the Kruskal–Wallis and Fisher’s exact test. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate progression-free survival, overall survival and time-to-progression curves, and the log-rank test was applied to compare survival curves. All statistical tests were two-sided, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Altogether 41 patients were included in our study. The majority were diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma primary tumor (n = 32). Replacement pattern proved to be the most common (n = 22), followed by desmoplastic (n = 15), and pushing (n = 4). There was no significant association found between histopathological growth patterns and stage (p = 0.105), secondary tumour focality (p = 0.898), largest diameter primary (p = 0.316) and secondary carcinoma (p = 0.441), completeness of resection (p = 0.492), and the presence of venous spread (p = 1). There were no significant results found between histopathological growth patterns and progression-free survival (p = 0.417), overall survival (p = 0.297), and time-to-progression (p = 0.267). Our results suggest that the prognostic value of histopathological growth patterns may be limited in a consecutively collected patient cohort.

    "title": "Harnessing CD39 inhibition to boost antitumor immunity with extracellular ATP.",
    "abstract": "CD39 (encoded by ENTPD1) has emerged as a target for oncologic therapies. Inhibition of CD39 preserves extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) and decreases extracellular adenosine (eADO) formation, thereby increasing the eATP/eADO ratio and promoting immune stimulation. RNA expression profiling of eATPases across all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates that ENTPD1 has the most widespread expression. Enzymatic characterization of these eATPases shows CD39 to have the greatest catalytic activity at pH 6.8, the prevailing mildly acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment, highlighting CD39 as an ideal therapeutic target of choice for eATP preservation. In an MC38 tumor model, inhibition of CD39 led to enhanced myeloid cell activation and tumor control when combined with anti-PD-1 therapy. To better understand how the murine results would translate to a human setting in which chemotherapy is the standard of care, a human monocyte-derived dendritic cell/T cell/carcinoma cell line coculture system was developed. CD39 inhibition led to greater production of IL-2, granzyme B, and IFNγ, demonstrating that chemotherapy-induced eATP generation is sufficient to promote myeloid cell activation, resulting in enhanced T cell function. Using the coculture system, we generated the first transcriptional eATP signature developed on primary human myeloid cells and applied it to real-world datasets, illustrating a response to eATP that can be measured in human tumors. These studies provide a mechanistic rationale for CD39 inhibition to promote antitumor immunity via the enhancement of eATP-driven myeloid cell activation of T cells across a variety of tumor settings and eATP-generative modalities.",

CD56+CD20+ NK cells exhibit hallmarks of cellular activation, including elevated NKp46, CD69, and CD137 expression, enhanced proliferative capacity, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-10).

Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrated that MS4A1-expressing NK cells possess a distinct molecular signature characterized by elevated granzyme K expression and memory-like features. These cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and accumulate in inflammatory tissues.

    "title": "High scattering sensitivity entropy imaging for breast tumor characterization and classification.",
    "abstract": "Diagnosing and characterizing breast lesions and tumors remains a common challenge in clinical practice. Ultrasound imaging stands out for its safety, real-time capability, and affordability. However, the image quality of conventional ultrasound examination is limited, and the diagnosis of ultrasonographic images depends heavily on the experience of the sonographer. Therefore, improving ultrasound images and extracting tissue information from ultrasound signals to provide auxiliary means is crucial for accurate breast tumor diagnosis. Medical ultrasound imaging has been widely used in clinical diagnosis. However, traditional ultrasound has limitations in the diagnosis of breast soft tissue diseases. This study proposed a high scattering sensitivity fuzzy entropy (FE) imaging method to enhance image contrast and improve detectability for breast tumors. Moreover, this imaging method can make a preliminary classification and characterization of benign and malignant breast lesions through quantitative analysis of ultrasound radio frequency data and the calculation of the entropy value without biopsy examination. To achieve the fuzzy entropy imaging, a sliding window is selected to traverse across the image with a step of one sampling point while the entropy value within the sliding window is calculated. This entropy value is assigned to the center pixel of the window. The parametric image was obtained after the entropy values of all pixels were calculated. During the clinical experiments, the breast lesions were classified as benign or malignant by biopsy examination. After entropy imaging, the average entropy value of the lesion area was calculated. The entropy values of all cases of benign and malignant tumors were averaged, respectively, to verify whether the fuzzy entropy can characterize the breast lesions. All the statistical analysis was conducted by one-sample t-test to obtain the mean value and standard deviation. The Tukey test was performed, and the effect size of Cohen's d was calculated to verify whether there was a significant difference between the entropy value of benign lesions and malignant lesions. In the clinical breast imaging experiment, the FE method obtained the highest Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.875 ± 0.047 (p < 0.0001) and F1 score of 0.876 ± 0.049 (p < 0.0001). The MCC and F1 scores of FE imaging were significantly different from those of other entropy imaging methods in the Tukey test (p < 0.0001). The effect sizes of Cohen's d of F1 score of FE method compared with the WSE method and hNSE method were 1.498 and 1.107, respectively. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of FE images increased by 124.37% (p < 0.0001) compared with B-mode images (5.210 ± 3.136, p < 0.0001). The above results show that the FE method has good comprehensive performance in improving the detection accuracy and contrast of breast lesions. The fuzzy entropy value of benign tumors (0.033 ± 0.0.14, p < 0.0001) is higher than that of malignant tumors (0.022 ± 0.013, p < 0.0001) with both statistical and practical significance, indicating that the benign and malignant tumors can be characterized and classified by fuzzy entropy value. The proposed ultrasound fuzzy entropy breast imaging method can effectively improve the ultrasound imaging performance and the ability to detect lesions, because fuzzy entropy can measure the microscopic chaos of breast tissue and enhance the scattering information characteristics in the signal. Meanwhile, fuzzy entropy imaging can classify benign and malignant lesions, because fuzzy entropy considers the causality within the ultrasound signal, avoiding information aliasing and loss, so that it can detect weaker information in the signal and can reflect organizational information more accurately.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming task that requires expert and skilled manpower, particularly for weight adjustment. Valuable attempts have been made to automate the treatment planning process as well as decrease computation time in recent years. Artificial intelligence tools and a knowledge-based planning (KBP) approach have played considerable roles in this regard. However, this area also requires more precise and smart approaches. The current study aims to advance KBP in two practical and impactful areas. First, it presents a novel approach to automate IMRT treatment planning using a mathematical optimization framework. Second, it proposes two innovative downsizing techniques designed to enhance computational efficiency and significantly reduce solving time, while evaluating their performance in terms of both treatment plan quality and time savings in an integrated manner. Two mathematical models were applied: QuadLin for treatment plan optimization and its revised model for automatically adjusting the weights of the QuadLin objective function. The study emphasizes improving computational efficiency and reducing solving time by introducing an innovative algorithm, called SVSIDB, which clusters voxels based on the dominant beamlet concept. Additionally, the hybrid ultra-heuristic ABC-K-Means technique was developed for voxel clustering. All models and techniques have been run on the data of 30 patients with head and neck cancer from a recently published real dataset, Open-KBP. Problems were solved in the CVX framework, with commercial solver Mosek, as well as programming in MATLAB. The results have been evaluated by both plan quality approach, satisfied clinical criteria, and computational efficiency, solving time reduction. The weights of the QuadLin objective function were automatically adjusted using the mathematical framework. Although the Auto-Imputed weights differed significantly from the manually assigned ones, the resulting plans showed no substantial differences in terms of plan quality. Automatic treatment plans improved satisfied clinical criteria by an average of over 21%, 15%, and at least 13% compared to the predicted dose, the reference plan, and previous research, respectively. Additionally, SVSIDB presented a systematic voxel clustering method that reduces solving time by approximately 50% compared to full-data models, while maintaining treatment plan quality. SVSIDB achieved an 81.3% clinical criteria satisfaction index, which was 10% higher than that of ABC-K-Means. In terms of time-saving performance, ABC-K-Means matched the efficiency of SVSIDB. This research makes two remarkable contributions: (1) the development of an automatic KBP framework and (2) introducing a novel, efficient downsizing technique. The Auto-Imputed weights preserved the quality of treatment plans despite substantial differences from manually adjusted weights. SVSIDB demonstrated an average quality index improvement of 12% compared to previous studies, including those by Fountain et al. and Babier et al. Notably, the SVSIDB-QuadLin pipeline not only reduced solving time but also improved plan quality, outperforming models based on full data and representing a substantial advancement over prior research.",

The quality of evidence for the outcomes of the meta-analysis was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

    "abstract": "Patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is essential to guarantee the requested accuracy and safety of high-precision radiotherapy treatments. With the widespread adoption of modulated-intensity techniques, there is a growing need for increased operational efficiency. The potential of machine learning (ML) to accurately predict PSQA results has been investigated in recent years. In particular, plan complexity metrics have been used as model input features to be related to the PSQA outcome results in a number of supervised ML models. However, an unsupervised cluster analysis, able to uncover hidden patterns or groupings in data, has not been yet performed. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the potential of different unsupervised ML methods to unravel hidden patterns and groupings in PSQA data based on a clustering analysis of plan complexity. A total of 1329 pretreatment verification data from 660 consecutive patients with different tumour sites treated using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were analyzed using the modulation complexity score (MCS) and the dynamic log-files generated by the linac. Predicted and measured fluences were compared using γ-analysis in terms of mean γ-values (γ<sub>mean</sub>) and γ-pass rate (γ<sub>%</sub>) at the 2%(local)/2 mm criterion. Three unsupervised clustering algorithms, including agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), K-means (KM) and Gaussian mixture models (GMM), were implemented to investigate the existence of natural groupings or clusters based on plan complexity. In addition, we subsequently trained several supervised models to validate cluster assignments on an external cohort of 202 VMAT arcs. For each clustering algorithms, the silhouette scores and the dendrogram analysis indicate the optimal number of clusters is three. The GMM clustered 65 arcs (4.9% of total arcs) into cluster 1 with mean values of γ<sub>%</sub>, γ<sub>mean</sub> and MCS of 76.7%, 0.85 and 0.112, respectively. 916 arcs (68.9% of total arcs) were grouped into cluster 2 with mean values of γ<sub>%</sub>, γ<sub>mean</sub> and MCS of 86.5%, 0.58 and 0.209, respectively. Lastly, 348 arcs (26.2% of total arcs) were grouped into cluster 3 with mean values of γ<sub>%</sub>, γ<sub>mean</sub> and MCS of 92.9%, 0.40 and 0.359, respectively. Cluster 1 was associated with overmodulated plans, providing a warning MCS cutoff value of 0.145 for prompt replanning. Similarly, cluster 3 was associated with PSQA optimality, providing a MCS cutoff value of 0.278, beyond which plans have an a-priori very high QA pass results and can avoid the pretreatment dosimetric verification. Head-and-neck cases reported the higher (12.0%) and the lower (4.0%) classification rates in clusters 1 and 3, respectively, suggesting a major increase of the complexity score for these plans. This study demonstrated the potential of clustering analysis to unravel hidden patterns of plan complexity in dosimetric quality assurance of VMAT treatments. The results suggested that a three-clusters classification scheme has a true basis in plan complexity, supporting the hypothesis that the MCS metric strongly underlies PSQA results.",

Research into paclitaxel resistance has yielded thousands of articles. However, this body of research has not been analyzed systematically and quantitatively. This study employs bibliometric analysis and visualisation techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to elucidate the contributions from countries and institutions, collaboration patterns, journal publication trends, research evolution, and current hotspots. Our findings reveal that leading research institutions in the United States, Europe, and East Asia hold significant advantages in this field. Specifically, the United States contributed the most to this field, with MD Anderson Cancer Center being the most prominent research institution and having a broad collaboration network. Prestigious oncology journals serve as primary platforms for disseminating key findings, with Cancer Research publishing the most relevant articles and having the highest co-citation frequency. We identified the main research branches by analysing keyword co-occurrence and keyword bursts, including treatment methods, drug delivery, mechanisms, and cellular response. Current research focuses on unveiling resistance mechanisms and exploring new therapeutic strategies. Paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer, particularly in TNBC and metastatic cases, remains an active and critical research area. Integrating nanotechnology into drug development and therapeutic strategies is a current focal point and promises to be a significant future direction. These insights highlight a strategic direction for future research, including strengthening international partnerships, deepening understanding of resistance mechanisms, and applying engineered therapeutics for targeted breast cancer treatments.",

    "title": "Knowledge-based trade-off prediction for NSCLC treatment planning using multi-output regression.",
    "abstract": "Knowledge-based planning (KBP) is a data-driven approach that utilizes the knowledge from previous high-quality treatment plans to predict dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters for organs-at-risk (OARs) in new cases. Research has demonstrated that KBP enhances plan quality, minimizes inter-patient and inter-institution variability, and significantly boosts time efficiency. However, current state-of-the-art KBP approaches only generate one set of planning goals for one point on the Pareto optimal surface without considering potential planning trade-offs. The objective of this study is to develop a KBP trade-off prediction model that can effectively assist clinical decision-making during the treatment planning process for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We created 13 volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan variations for each patient in our dataset (n = 53), consisting of one balanced plan and 12 alternative plans with trade-off considerations. These trade-off plans incorporated three levels (0-2) of sparing priority for each OAR, including the esophagus, lungs, heart, and spinal cord. The first three principal components (PCs) of each OAR-specific DVH were used as target variables, while 26 anatomical features served as predictors. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). A forward feature selection process identified the top five anatomical features, which were then used to train a random forest multi-output regression model to predict the first three DVH PCs for each of the 13 plan-OAR variations. We compared the performance of our trade-off prediction model with that of a balanced model trained on the balanced plan without any trade-off considerations. The evaluation metrics included root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for key dose-volume metrics of the DVH curves. The trade-off prediction model significantly outperformed the balanced model in terms of average RMSE (5.32 vs. 27.3) compared to the planned DVHs for all 13 treatment plans. The trade-off model also achieved a lower MAE for all the clinical dose-volume metrics, including spinal cord D<sub>max</sub> (12.5 vs. 15.5 Gy, p < 0.01), esophagus D<sub>max</sub> (1.7 vs. 2.7 Gy, p < 0.01), left lung V<sub>20Gy</sub> (7.8% vs. 27.5%, p < 0.01), right lung V<sub>20Gy</sub> (7.4% vs. 27.8%, p < 0.01), and heart V<sub>30Gy</sub> (10.8% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.01). Our proposed KBP trade-off model reliably predicts plan tradeoff variations for the treatment of NSCLC patients. Incorporating this model into the pre-planning process may serve as a decision support tool for physicians and planners by providing feasible trade-off estimations, thereby improving the efficiency of the treatment planning workflow.",

    "abstract": "Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a recognized precancerous condition associated with gastric cancer (GC). Although previous bibliometric analyses have separately examined GC or CAG, few studies have comprehensively explored their interrelationship. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate research progress, identify developmental trends and hotspots, and provide guidance for future studies addressing the association between GC and CAG. Publications concerning GC and CAG were retrieved from the Web of Science database, covering studies published between 1 January 2003 and 5 March 2025. Bibliometric and visualization analyses were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. In total, 1062 articles published from 2003 to 2025 were included, revealing a steady increase in publications each year. China, Japan, and the USA were the most productive countries. China Medical University contributed the highest number of publications, while Yuan, Y, and Correa, P were identified as the most productive and highly cited authors. Although numerous journals have contributed to the field, World Journal of Gastroenterology and Gastroenterology the emerged as leading journals based on publication numbers and citation frequency. Keyword and co-cited reference analysis indicated that factors influencing the progression from CAG to GC and endoscopic resection (ER) represent current research hotspots. Furthermore, future research trends are likely to emphasize GC screening, diagnosis, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This bibliometric analysis of studies concerning GC and CAG identifies current research hotspots and provides valuable recommendations for future research directions.",

    "abstract": "CT-guided percutaneous lung nodule biopsy (CLNB) is a critical diagnostic tool for pulmonary lesions, yet traditional methods are limited by operator-dependent variability and higher complication risks. The dual-laser beam design of the laser positioning (LP) device, utilizing real-time trajectory correction, holds potential to improve puncture accuracy and reduce human error, but its clinical value in CLNB remains to be systematically validated. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the advanced puncture efficacy and clinical safety of the LP device during CLNB. A total of 115 patients (61±12 [SD]years; 83 women) were included in this study. All patients were allocated into two groups: one group underwent CLNB without an LP device, while the other group used an LP device during the procedure. The efficacy of the procedures was assessed based on the success rate, the adjustments number and the puncture time. Additionally, safety evaluations focused on complications associated with the percutaneous surgery. The success rate of the first puncture in the LP group was significantly higher than in the CLNB group [88.70%(55/62) vs. 52.80%(28/53), p < 0.001]. The puncture time was significantly lower in the LP group (9.71±4.20 vs. 18.21±6.53 min, p < 0.001). When analyzing the skin-to-lesion distance, categorized into two ranges of 20-60 mm and > 60 mm, the LP group consistently required less time for the procedure (9.66±5.20 vs. 16.86±5.16 min, p < 0.001), (9.93±3.97 vs. 19.31±7.39 min, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of complications in the LP group was significantly lower than in the CLNB group [6.45% (4/62) vs. 50.94% (27/53), p < 0.001]. The LP device improved the puncture accuracy of CLNB, shortened the operation time, and reduced the incidence of complications.",

    "title": "Drug repurposing in oncology: a path beyond the bottleneck.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is a major worldwide health burden, with rising incidence and mortality rates highlighting the critical need for more effective and accessible treatment alternatives. Conventional drug development is often hindered by long timelines, high prices, and significant failure rates, making it unable to fulfil the rapidly increasing therapeutic demands. In this context, drug repurposing, identifying new therapeutic applications for existing medications with proven safety profiles, has emerged as a potential and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug discovery. Although numerous studies have explored the anticancer prospects of repurposed drugs, there exists a lack of systematic and cumulative knowledge regarding the varied therapeutic classes of interest for oncological purposes. This is critical as a deeper understanding of mechanisms, discovery methods, and translational challenges would significantly boost the clinical use of repurposed drugs. This review provides an overview of ongoing drug repurposing activity in anticancer therapy, targeting diverse therapeutic groups like cardiovascular, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and antipsychotic drugs. It highlights approved drugs such as metformin, which acts on the AMPK/mTOR pathway to suppress cancer cell proliferation, thalidomide, which is approved for use in multiple myeloma because it has antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, and propranolol, which inhibits β-adrenergic signaling, suppressing VEGF-induced angiogenesis in breast and ovarian cancer. Drugs such as statins, sertraline, and ribavirin target different pathways like HMG-CoA reductase, autophagy regulation, and eIF4E inhibition, respectively. Regulatory pathways like the FDA's 505(b)(2) process, orphan drug status, and approaches for overcoming intellectual property issues are discussed. Through the convergence of mechanistic insight and clinical and regulatory perspectives, drug repurposing is a pragmatic approach to expand oncologic therapeutic options and promote bench-to-bedside translation. It also addresses major issues within this context, including tumor heterogeneity, regulatory barriers, and translational gaps, restricting clinical acceptance of repurposed drugs. Through the examination of these aspects, the potential of drug repurposing as an innovative strategy in oncology is shown to offer efficient, cost-effective, and rapidly deployable therapy. These options can enhance patient outcomes and change the future of cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) has a high mortality rate due to the diagnosis in advanced stages. Aberrant DNA methylation is the earliest event in carcinogenesis and can be noninvasively detected in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from gastric cancer patients. A total of 143 serum samples were analyzed, including 33 GC patients, 30 chronic gastritis (ChG) patients, and 80 healthy individuals. Additionally, tissue samples were collected from 30 GC patients (stages I-IV) and 38 ChG patients. Methylation patterns of ten genes were examined in GC cells, as well as in serum and tissue samples from GC, ChG, and control groups using methylation-specific qPCR. Statistical evaluations were conducted on various parameters including Ct differences, categorical variables, sensitivity, and specificity. APC, CDH1, RASSF1A, hMLH1, RUNX3, p16, SFRP2, RNF180, PCDH10, and RPRM were all significantly hypermethylated in the tissues of GC patients compared to those with ChG (P < 0.001). SFRP2, RPRM, APC, PCDH10, and RNF180 genes were analyzed in sera of 3 groups. Among them, SFRP2 methylation was detected in 71.87% of GC, 16.6% of ChG and 8.8% of the control group. The methylation frequencies of RPRM were 66.6% in GC, 13.3% in ChG, and 7.5% in the control group. In a dual-gene panel assay combining SFRP2 and RPRM, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting gastric cancer in serum samples were 57.58% and 96.25%, respectively, when comparing the cancer and control groups. The sensitivity was 78.79%, the specificity was 90.00% and AUC was 0.931 for GC and control groups (P < 0.0001). The sensitivity was 78.79%, the specificity was 83.33% and AUC was 0.879 for the discrimination of GC and ChG (P < 0.0001). Methylation of 10 genes were studied and a prototype early diagnosis tool for GC utilizing SFRP2 and RPRM with high sensitivity and specificity was developed.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, which can be categorized as common and uncommon mutations. Among the uncommon mutations, EGFR exon 20 mutations occur most frequently. Of these, EGFR exon 20 Q787Q is a relatively frequent mutation and is a synonymous polymorphism mutation that does not alter the amino acid sequence of the EGFR protein; however, the effects of this mutation remain unclear. We analyzed the clinicopathological features and prognoses of patients with EGFR exon 20 Q787Q mutation in NSCLC. Patients diagnosed with NSCLC who underwent complete resection at Kitasato University Hospital between 2010 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed for EGFR mutations. Patients with genetic mutations other than those in EGFR were excluded from the analysis. Patients with EGFR exon 20 Q787Q mutation were compared with those harboring wild-type EGFR using a cohort selected by propensity score matching. Among the 693 eligible patients, EGFR mutations were assessed in 349 patients. Of these, 122 (35.0%) displayed common mutations, 72 (20.6%) exhibited uncommon or compound mutations, and 155 (44.4%) showed wild-type EGFR. Within the group exhibiting uncommon or compound mutations, 39 (11.2%) patients presented a single exon 20 Q787Q mutation. When the prognosis and recurrence rates were compared, patients with EGFR exon 20 Q787Q mutation exhibited superior overall survival and lower recurrence rates than those harboring wild-type EGFR. Patients with EGFR exon 20 Q787Q mutation, a synonymous polymorphism mutation, exhibited different characteristics compared with those harboring wild-type EGFR.",

    "abstract": "This study comprehensively evaluated the impact of aperture shape controller (ASC) on volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) clinical treatment planning. A total of 248 VMAT plans for head and neck, prostate, post mastectomy breast, gastric MALT lymphoma, rectum, and Lung SBRT for treatments performed between 2018 and 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. These treatment plans were divided into two groups: before (ASC-OFF group) and after (ASC-ON group) the clinical implementation of ASC. The performance of ASC in terms of plan complexity was evaluated by between group comparisons of the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) modulation complexity score (MCS<sub>v</sub>) and jaw tracking complexity score (JTCS), plan quality using dosimetric parameters, and plan deliverability. The overall MCS<sub>v</sub> and JTCS of the ASC-OFF and ASC-ON groups were 0.318 and 0.369 (p < 0.001) and 2.85 cm and 2.98 cm (p = 0.10), respectively. In the ASC-ON group, the complexity of MLC motions was significantly lower and the complexity of jaw motions higher. In addition, most dosimetric parameters were comparable between groups or better in the ASC-ON group. There was no significant difference in the gamma passing rate of 3%/2 mm between the two groups, although at tighter criteria, the gamma passing rate was higher in the ASC-ON group. The use of ASC reduced the complexity of MLC motions without compromising the plan quality. Furthermore, this study found that ASC allows jaw tracking to be more effective.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy. While methods exist to generate voxel-wise uncertainty maps from DL-based auto-segmentation models, these maps are rarely presented to clinicians. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of DL-generated uncertainty maps on experienced radiation oncologists during the manual correction of DL-based auto-segmentation for prostate radiotherapy. Two nnUNet DL models were trained with 10-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 434 patient cases undergoing ultra-hypofractionated MRI-only radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The models performed prostate clinical target volume (CTV) and rectum segmentation. Each cross-validation model was evaluated on an independent test set of 35 patient cases. Segmentation uncertainty was calculated voxel-wise as the SoftMax standard deviation (0-0.5, n = 10) and visualized as a fixed scale color-coded map. Four experienced oncologists were asked to: Step 1: Rate the quality of and confidence in the DL segmentations using a four- and five-point Likert scale, respectively, and edit the segmentations without access to the uncertainty map. Step 2: Repeat step 1 after at least 4 weeks, but this time with the color-coded uncertainty map available. Oncologists were asked to blend the uncertainty map with the DL segmentation and MRI volume. Segmentation edit time was recorded for both steps. In step 2, oncologists also provided free-text feedback on the benefits and drawbacks of using the uncertainty map during segmentation. A histogram analysis was performed to compare the number of voxels edited between step 1 and step 2 for different uncertainty levels (bins with 0.1 intervals). The DL models achieved high-quality segmentations with a mean Dice coefficient per oncologist of 0.97-0.99, calculated between edited and unedited segmentation in step 1 for the prostate CTV and rectum. While the overall quality rating for rectum segmentations decreased slightly on a group level in step 2 compared to step 1, individual responses varied. Some oncologists rated the quality higher for the prostate CTV segmentation with the uncertainty map present, while others rated it lower. Similarly, confidence ratings varied across oncologists for prostate CTV and rectum. Decreased segmentation time was recorded for three oncologists using uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 min per patient case, corresponding to 14%-33% time reduction. Three oncologists found the uncertainty maps helpful, and one reported benefit was the ability to identify regions of interest more quickly. The histogram analysis had fewer voxel edits in regions of low uncertainty in step 2 compared to step 1. Specifically, 50% fewer voxel edits were recorded for the uncertainty region 0.0-0.1, suggesting increased trust in the DL model's prediction in these areas. Presenting DL uncertainty information to experienced radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Regions with low uncertainty were less likely to be edited, indicating increased reliance on the model's predictions. Additionally, uncertainty maps can improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time. DL-based segmentation uncertainty can be a valuable tool in clinical practice, enhancing the efficiency of radiotherapy planning.",

    "title": "Resistance to oncolytic virotherapy: Multidimensional mechanisms and therapeutic breakthroughs (Review).",
    "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses (OV) are an emerging form of immunotherapy that utilize naturally occurring or engineered viruses to specifically infect and lyse tumor cells. They achieve tumor treatment through direct tumor cell killing or by inducing immunogenic cell death to enhance immune responses. However, the efficacy of OV has been suboptimal in clinical trials. This review comprehensively examines mechanisms of resistance to OV through three interconnected dimensions: The characteristics of tumors and tumor cells, factors related to stromal cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the host immune status. Potential solutions targeting these mechanisms are also proposed. For instance, OV typically achieve tumor selectivity through tumor‑specific receptors or specific promoters. However, due to inter‑ and intratumoral heterogeneity, the lack of such specific receptors or promoters in tumor cells can lead to off‑target effects of OV, resulting in treatment resistance. The ECM in the tumor microenvironment, such as hyaluronic acid, may also impede viral transport. Additionally, the clearance of OV by immune cells can contribute to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes of OV treatment. Consequently, investigating predictive biomarkers of OV efficacy, utilizing ECM‑degrading enzymes and combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a promising strategy to augment the therapeutic effects of OV. Synthesizing current evidence, it is anticipated that future investigations will optimize the therapeutic effects of OV treatment and bring better immunotherapeutic outcomes for cancer patients.",

Although patients with early‑stage NPC can achieve a high cure rate through radiotherapy, recurrence and distant metastasis remain the primary causes of treatment failure in patients with advanced‑stage NPC. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of covalently closed non‑coding RNAs involved in multiple aspects of tumor biology. Recent evidence has shown that certain circRNAs can encode functional peptides, which participate in the regulation of tumor‑related signaling pathways. In NPC, circRNAs have been implicated in the modulation of signaling pathways, including NF‑κB and JAK/STAT, both of which are activated in the EBV‑infected microenvironment. Furthermore, frequently mutated genes in NPC, such as TNF receptor‑associated factor 3 and cylindromatosis lysine 63 deubiquitinase, are known regulators of the NF‑κB pathway, suggesting a potential link between genetic alterations and circRNA‑related mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the biological mechanisms of circRNA‑encoded peptides, summarizes the expression and function of circRNA in NPC and focuses on discussing the potential roles of circRNA‑encoded peptides in tumor microenvironment regulation, immune escape and clinical application prospects.

Evidence shows that beyond supporting tumor growth, the TME also promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and contributes to treatment resistance, ultimately affecting patient prognosis. Cell‑to‑cell communication within the TME is driven by secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and interferons, which are produced not only by tumor cells but also by various stromal cells and immune cells. These proteins form a complex signaling network that promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and enables tumors to evade innate and adaptive immune responses. Antibody arrays are a technology that can simultaneously screen hundreds of secreted proteins in complex biological samples, aiding in the exploration of this complex signaling network. By combining high‑throughput multiplex immunoassays such as antibody arrays with cellular and molecular biology techniques, researchers have uncovered complex regulatory mechanisms of cytokine networks within the TME. The present review summarized recent findings on the communication between tumor cells and the TME, as well as key secreted proteins essential for tumor progression and the development of therapeutic resistance.

    "title": "Role of the tumor microenvironment in promoting treatment resistance in urothelial carcinoma (Review).",
    "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) presents considerable treatment challenges, primarily due to the high rates of therapeutic resistance observed in affected patients. Currently, therapeutic strategies often fail to yield satisfactory outcomes; therefore, there is a need for innovative treatment approaches. The tumor microenvironment (TME) serves a key role in driving treatment resistance in UC, revealing that components such as cancer‑associated fibroblasts, tumor‑associated macrophages and the extracellular matrix contribute to tumor survival and evasion of therapy. Understanding the mechanisms through which the TME influences treatment resistance is key for developing effective countermeasures. Targeting the TME may be an effective therapeutic strategy, as this approach may increase the efficacy of existing treatments and overcome barriers to response. The present review aims to summarize current knowledge regarding the role of the TME in UC treatment resistance, discuss potential strategies for targeting the TME and highlight future research directions. The translation of insights from studies on the TME into therapeutic strategies may improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from this challenging malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Notch3 is a key regulator in various cancers, playing a crucial role in maintaining stemness and promoting epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, its differential expression and regulatory mechanisms in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cancer stem cells remain poorly understood. To investigate this, the present study examined Notch3 expression in NSCLC through Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and validated the results with immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. EMT was induced by TGF‑β1 in NSCLC cells and functional assays (Transwell, wound healing and sphere formation) were performed to assess cellular changes. <i>In vivo</i> experiments using a xenograft mouse model were conducted to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis. The results showed that high Notch3 expression was associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Downregulation of Notch3 inhibited TGF‑β1‑induced EMT and CSC characteristics, resulting in reduced tumorigenic potential, whereas overexpression of the Notch3 intracellular domain enhanced these effects. Silencing Notch3 suppressed EMT and markedly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo</i>. These findings demonstrated that Notch3 regulated EMT and CSC properties in NSCLC, promoting tumor recurrence and metastasis. Notch3 thus represents a promising therapeutic target and prognostic marker for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "L‑type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) has emerged as a critical molecular target for advancing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a promising treatment that leverages selective boron accumulation and neutron irradiation to eradicate cancer cells. The frequent upregulation of LAT1 in aggressive tumors (such as gliomas and specific subtypes of lung and breast cancer) underpins its essential role as the principal mediator of tumor‑selective boron compound uptake in BNCT. The present review comprehensively examines the structure and function of LAT1, the mechanistic principles of boron transport (including LAT1 mediation) and the key regulatory pathways governing BNCT efficacy. Building on this and given the role of LAT1 in reprogramming tumor metabolism through amino acid transport, advanced metabolomics tools, particularly liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, offer a novel approach for clarifying the contribution of LAT1 to BNCT. These techniques hold significant potential to map metabolic profiles altered by LAT1‑mediated boron compound uptake, thereby elucidating downstream biochemical consequences relevant to the therapeutic efficacy and resistance mechanisms. Synthesizing the dual role of LAT1 as both a vulnerability and therapeutic target in BNCT, the present review systematizes key challenges, including the need for selective boron compounds, resistance mechanisms and off‑target effects, while mapping actionable pathways to unlock its potential via refined regulation strategies, next‑generation delivery agents and personalized approaches. By addressing these knowledge gaps, this synthesis provides a foundational framework to harness LAT1‑targeted BNCT, offering potential to advance precision oncology paradigms and improve clinical outcomes for patients with LAT1‑enriched tumors.",

    "abstract": "Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options, leading to poor clinical outcomes and the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Nintedanib, a United States Food and Drug Administration‑approved multi‑kinase inhibitor with anti‑fibrotic and anti‑angiogenic properties, has shown promise in cancer treatment. However, its precise molecular effects on TNBC have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of nintedanib in TNBC using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models, specifically focusing on its regulatory effects on key oncogenic pathways. The present study utilized TNBC cell lines (MDA‑MB‑231 and 4T1) and BALB/c mice to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of nintedanib. Cell viability and clonogenic capacity were assessed using Cell Counting Kit‑8 and colony formation assays. Subsequently, apoptosis induction and cell cycle progression were determined by flow cytometry, and cell migration and invasion were analyzed through scratch and Transwell assays. To identify underlying mechanisms, potential molecular targets were identified via bioinformatics and network pharmacology, and were validated through western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Finally, an orthotopic TNBC mouse model was established and monitored in real time by multimodal ultrasound imaging. The results revealed that nintedanib significantly inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and suppressed stem cell‑like properties. Furthermore, it induced cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis revealed that nintedanib activated tumor protein p73 (TP73), leading to the disruption of the p53‑peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα)/PI3K‑Akt signaling axis. Additionally, it downregulated epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, including Snail and zinc finger E‑box‑binding homeobox protein 1, thereby mitigating tumor invasiveness. <i>In vivo</i>, nintedanib treatment effectively reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis and stiffness, indicating its potential as a viable therapeutic agent for TNBC. In conclusion, nintedanib exerts potent anti‑TNBC effects by modulating TP73, disrupting oncogenic signaling via the p53‑PPARα/PI3K‑Akt axis, and attenuating EMT‑associated transcription factors. These findings highlight its potential as a promising targeted therapy for TNBC, warranting further clinical exploration.",

    "abstract": "Lipoprotein‑associated phospholipase A2 (Lp‑PLA2), an important member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily, was originally investigated for its proinflammatory role in cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have revealed its significant role in tumorigenesis: It can act as either a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on the context. The present review systematically outlined the dual mechanisms by which Lp‑PLA2 contributes to cancer pathogenesis. As a tumor promoter, it promotes cancer progression via the induction of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, glutathione peroxidase 4‑mediated resistance to ferroptosis, and vascular endothelial growth factor‑-dependent angiogenesis; conversely, as a tumor suppressor, it inhibits tumor growth by suppressing the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in breast cancer gene 1‑mutated cancers or by promoting apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations clarify the interactions between Lp‑PLA2 and critical oncogenic pathways, such as the Notch and HIF1α pathways, while emphasizing the functional dichotomy that is influenced by the microenvironment. Current evidence supports the development of microenvironment‑guided targeting strategies and the potential value of Lp‑PLA2 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings contribute to a theoretical framework for comprehending the context‑dependent roles of Lp‑PLA2 and may guide the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Integrating both targeted delivery and stimulus-responsive release into a single small molecule for drug delivery presents challenges related to synthesis, stability, and efficacy. In this study, single-molecular lipids incorporating a Lewis pair (Lp-lipids) are described, composed of a Lewis acid (phenylboronic acid) and a Lewis base (amine) within a single small molecular structure, to formulate lipid nanoparticles for antibiotic delivery. For targeted delivery to bacterial biofilms, the phenylboronic acid selectively binds to bacteria or biofilms by forming boronate ester bonds with diols in the microbial dextran or peptidoglycan. Additionally, the amine group responds to the acidic microenvironment, enhancing electrostatic interactions with bacteria and biofilms. Regarding stimulus-responsive drug release, the Lewis base reacts to low pH, while the Lewis acid responds to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ATP, triggering changes in the hydrophobicity and structural integrity of the lipid nanoparticles. These changes facilitate the release of encapsulated antibiotics, effectively eradicating both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo. The combined targeting and stimuli-responsive release properties of Lp-lipids significantly enhance their potential for biomedical applications and clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the potential of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT)-based radiomics in preoperative risk stratification for the prediction of initial recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC). The retrospective analysis included 236 PTC cases (165 in the training cohort, 71 in the validation cohort) collected between July 2020 and June 2021. Tumor segmentation was carried out in both intratumoral and peritumoral areas (1 mm inner and outer to the tumor boundary). Three regionspecific rad-scores were developed (rad-score [VOI<sup>whole</sup>], rad-score [VOI<sup>outer layer</sup>], and rad-score [VOI<sup>inner layer</sup>]), respectively. Three radiomics models incorporating these rad-scores and additional risk factors were compared to a clinical model alone. The optimal radiomics model was presented as a nomogram. Rad-scores from peritumoral regions (VOI<sup>outer layer</sup> and VOI<sup>inner layer</sup>) outperformed the intratumoral rad-score (VOI<sup>whole</sup>). All radiomics models surpassed the clinical model, with peritumoral-based models (radiomics models 2 and 3) outperforming the intratumoral-based model (radiomics model 1). The top-performing nomogram, which included tumor size, tumor site, and rad-score (VOI<sup>inner layer</sup>), achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.877 in the training cohort and 0.876 in the validation cohort. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration, clinical utility, and stability. DECT-based intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics advance PTC initial recurrence risk prediction, providing clinical radiology with precise predictive tools. Further work is needed to refine the model and enhance its clinical application. Radiomics analysis of DECT, particularly in peritumoral regions, offers valuable predictive information for assessing the risk of initial recurrence in PTC.",

    "abstract": "Amarogentin is a secoiridoid glycoside that was initially isolated from the medicinal plant Swertia chirayita. It is well-known for its formidable bitter characteristics and the varied pharmacological actions it possesses. Especially in both conventional and modern medical practices, this molecule has garnered considerable attention due to its enormous therapeutic potential. Amarogentin possesses a wide range of biological actions, some of which include functions that are hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and antibacterial. The hepatoprotective function it possesses is achieved by enhancing antioxidant defense systems and reducing liver damage caused by toxins. It is believed that the ability of amarogentin to block proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-6, is responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties. The stimulation of apoptosis and the reduction of cancer cell proliferation in various tumor models are two additional ways in which it demonstrates promising anti-cancer potential. The antidiabetic activity of amarogentin is characterized by the modification of glucose metabolism as well as an improvement in insulin sensitivity. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of amarogentin, further research is needed to investigate its bioavailability and stability in the human body. This is despite the fact that it possesses a wide range of pharmacological advantages. There are formulation options that could improve its pharmacokinetic profile. Some examples of these strategies are nanoparticle delivery systems and derivatization. In general, amarogentin exhibits a great deal of promise as a natural therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Accordingly, there is a need for further research into the mechanisms underlying its clinical applications and potential uses.",

In this work, we set out to explore its seed proteome for the isolation of lectins and characterize them Method: A protein of about 21kDa was isolated and purified using chromatography techniques from the ammonium sulphate crude protein extract. It was evaluated for hemagglutination activity on rabbit erythrocyte suspension, trypsin inhibitory activity using chemical assay, and evaluation of anti-cancer activity using cell lines. Mass and transcriptome analysis were done to deduce the complete sequence of the isolated protein. Using functional, mass, and transcriptome analysis, the protein was identified as AEL (Abelmoschus esculentus lectin), which was reported earlier. Only a partial sequence of AEL was known, and in this work, we have deduced its complete sequence. It showed significant anti-- cancer activity against HeLa (cervical cancer) and T84 (colon cancer) with MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) of 20μg/ml and 40% and 30% reduction in cell viability at 100μg/ml and insignificant effect on ACHN (adenocarcinoma) cell lines. No significant effect was seen with the tested doses on normal control human cell lines HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells). The purified protein shows specificity for lactose and galactose in the hemagglutination assay and trypsin inhibition activity. Studies of okra seed proteome lead to purification of AEL, a 21 kDa protein with dual hemagglutination activity and trypsin inhibitory activity. It showed potential anticancer activity in cervical, colon cancer cell lines and minimal effects on adenocarcinoma and control cell lines, suggesting specificity. The complete sequence of AEL was elucidated which will aid in its bioinformatics analysis, was isolated from okra seeds.

As the liver plays a critical role in digestion, detoxification, energy storage, and protein synthesis, any impairment in its function can lead to significant health complications. The study aims to identify effective herbal agents that may support liver health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using scientific databases and platforms including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, HINARI, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The review includes studies that investigate the hepatoprotective potential of herbal bioactives, while research related to hepatic cancers was excluded to maintain a focus on non-malignant liver disorders. The review identifies several medicinal plants and their active constituents that exhibit hepatoprotective properties. These bioactives function through various pharmacological mechanisms at the molecular level. Common liver conditions addressed include fatty liver, hepatitis, fibrosis, steatosis, and cirrhosis. The reviewed compounds demonstrate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activities, supporting their role in liver disease management. The findings support growing evidence that herbal bioactives can modulate key molecular pathways involved in liver disorders. These results align with existing studies highlighting the benefits of plant-based treatments. However, the limitations include a lack of clinical trial data, poor bioavailability of some compounds, and the need for standardized formulations. Further research is necessary to validate these results in human populations. Herbal bioactives such as flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, vitamins, and essential oils show promising hepatoprotective effects. This review emphasizes the importance of understanding their precise molecular mechanisms and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profiles. These insights are crucial for developing safe, effective, and standardized herbal therapies for liver disease management.",

The findings were analyzed and discussed to provide an in-depth understanding aligned with the study's objectives. Recurrent ovarian cancer is a major clinical challenge that occurs when the disease returns after initial treatment and a period of remission. Recurrence typically arises when residual cancer cells remain in the body after treatment, eventually leading to disease progression. Genetic factors, including mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 and other genetic markers, play a crucial role in ovarian cancer recurrence and influence responses to therapies. The immune system's response to cancer cells is also critical, with therapeutic interventions either enhancing or reducing efficacy.

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis (OP) is a prevalent condition in postmenopausal women, marked by reduced bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Raloxifene (RLX), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is the only drug approved for the management of OP in this patient population. RLX works by mimicking estrogen's effects on bone, reducing bone resorption and thereby increasing bone mineral density. However, despite its benefits, conventional oral RLX formulations have significant limitations. Its low bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility are compounded by extensive first-pass metabolism, which significantly reduces the drug's efficacy. Recent research has focused on nanocarriers for RLX to overcome these challenges, with lipid-based nanocarriers emerging as a promising approach to improve solubility, enhance absorption, and bypass first-pass metabolism via lymphatic uptake. The authors gathered information about RLX from articles published up to 2025 and listed in Pub- Med, Web of Science, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and similar databases. The keywords used in our search included \"Osteoporosis\" \"Raloxifene\" \"nanocarriers\" etc. Results: The review of existing literature reveals substantial progress in developing innovative drug delivery systems for RLX, aimed at overcoming the limitations of conventional oral dosage forms in the treatment of OP and cancer. Several studies underscore the potential of novel formulations, including lipid-based nanocarriers, to improve raloxifene's pharmacokinetic profile, particularly through enhanced solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability. The nanocarriers mediated raloxifene delivery represent promising strategies to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in osteoporosis treatment. By improving solubility and bypassing first-pass metabolism, these novel systems can potentially reduce dose-related side effects, offering safer and more effective long-term options for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This approach supports the continued exploration of both oral and non-oral delivery methods to overcome the limitations of conventional raloxifene formulations.",

    "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a drug of choice for the treatment of different types of cancers and autoimmune disorders. Despite its effectiveness, its toxicity is the major drawback of its use. It is a chemotherapy drug known to cause neurotoxicity, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the brain. We evaluated the outcome of ethanol leaf extract of Jimson weed (ELEJW) on neurotoxicity prompted by MXT use. Forty albino rats (male) were assigned into four categories (n=10): 1=Control (5 mg/kg normal saline); 2= Extract (200 mg/kg ELEJW); 3= MXT (20 mg/kg MXT); 4= Test (200 mg/kg ELEJW + 20 mg/kg MXT). MXT was given on day 18 only (ip) while ELEJW was by gavage for 21 days. Identified compounds from the plant were docked against caspase-3, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf-α), while the drug-likeness properties were investigated in silico using ADNETSAR and Swiss adme web servers. MXT injection caused oxidative stress, inflammation, and increased cerebral cell death in rats as evidenced by elevation in SOD, CAT, GPx, AchE, and Caspase-3 activities and also increases in MDA, NO, IL-6, and TNF- α concentrations. Intriguingly, ELEJW administration to rats reversed this trend. Jimson weed showed a significant reduction in these neurotoxic effects. Jimson weed treatment led to a decrease in oxidative stress markers, a reduction in inflammatory cytokines, and a decrease in apoptotic markers in the brain tissue of methotrexate-treated rats via modulation of caspase-3, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf-α). The histological alterations caused by MXT were resolved as intact neuronal cells with normal glial and pyramidal cells were observed. In silico analysis identified two compounds 1H-Indole and 2,3-Dimethylquinolin- 4(1H)-one from ELEJW with potentially strong binding affinities towards caspase-3, interleukin- 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf-α) via molecular docking and expression of stable hydrogen, pi, sigma, and Van der Waals' interactions between target proteins, and screened ligands, while the drug-likeness properties of these compounds show no significant violation of Lipinski, Ghose, and Verber rules. Co-treatment of ELEJW with MXT overturned the oxidative stress, inflammation, and histological alterations perpetuated by MXT. Therefore, Jimson weed should be explored as a supportive therapy for the management of MXT-induced neurological derangements.",

    "abstract": "The differential DNA methylation (DNAm) of the CpG site cg05575921, within the gene body of AHRR, has been shown to be a robust indicator of tobacco smoking exposure. This study aimed to determine if cg05575921 at AHRR DNAm had a clinically relevant association with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and compare its predictive performance with self-reported smoking assessments. Whole blood cg05575921 (AHRR) DNAm was assessed using a simple droplet digital PCR assay in a cohort of 2784 elderly individuals. DNAm values were used to impute smoking status and its independent association with prevalent CVD. Consistent with previous reports, cg05575921 (AHRR) had significant, sensitive, and specific associations with self-reported smoking status (SRSS: never, ex-, current. <0.0001 between groups). This DNAm marker was also associated with the length of smoking cessation in ex-smokers (rho 0.55, p < .0001, Spearman rank correlation). A key finding of this study was that cg05575921 DNAm had a distinct non-linear relationship with a history of prevalent CVD. DNAm-imputed smoking status (ex-smoker quit >21 years, ex-smoker quit <21 years, and current smoker), remained significantly associated with CVD after covariant adjustment, which included SRSS (OR 2.5, 3.1, and 6.0, p < .0001, respectively). Even among never smokers, cg05575921 values were also significantly associated with CVD (Mann-Whitney U test p < .0001). Imputed (cg05575921 AHRR) DNAm smoking status appears to have a significant and independent association with the prevalence of CVD. This association is stronger than that of conventional SRSS and may suggest potential utility to improve existing CVD risk prediction scores. The results of this study were consistent with previous reports showing that the DNA methylation status of cg05575921 is highly accurate in identifying smoking status (current, ex-smokers, or never smokers), including the length of time an ex-smoker had quit. The marker's levels also had a strong relationship with prevalent CVD, including after adjusting for other risk factors, such as age, diabetes, and even self-reported smoking status. This study makes a strong contribution to a growing body of work suggesting that this DNAm marker may have substantial clinical utility to aid \"precision-medicine\" chronic disease risk prediction.",

Early detection through Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) screening is essential, particularly among at-risk populations. However, evidence linking dietary consumption behavior to FIT test outcomes remains limited in Thailand, especially in the southern region. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of positive FIT results and to examine the association between dietary consumption behavior and sociodemographic factors with positive FIT results among at-risk individuals in Southern Thailand. A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among participants aged 50-70 years who underwent FIT screening in primary healthcare units in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province between October 2023 and August 2024. Totally, 382 participants were included, 191 cases with positive- and 191 controls with negative-FIT results. The case-control ratio was 1:1. Data were collected using structured questionnaires assessing demographic characteristics, health risk factors, and dietary consumption behaviors. Crude and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with a positive FIT result. The prevalence of positive FIT results was 13.77% (95% CI: 12.04-15.66). Multivariate analysis showed low dietary consumption behavior was prevalent (83.77%), it was not significantly associated with FIT positivity (AOR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.71-1.68), after adjusting for confounders. However, lower education level (AOR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.32-0.78), agricultural occupation (AOR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.25-0.82), and monthly income between 3,000-8,000 Baht (AOR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.27-3.49) were significantly associated with a positive FIT result. Education, occupation, and income were significantly associated with positive FIT results. Targeted education and risk-reduction strategies are recommended to improve CRC screening outcomes in at-risk populations.",

    "title": "Long-Term Outcomes of Autologous Breast Reconstruction with or without Post-Mastectomy Radiotherapy.",
    "abstract": "The number of immediate breast reconstructions has significantly increased in recent years. Autologous breast reconstruction, in particular, offers superior long-term cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, the effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on autologous reconstructions remain a subject of debate. This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of autologous breast reconstruction in patients who underwent PMRT compared to those who did not. Patients who underwent mastectomy and immediate autologous reconstruction between 2018 and 2023 were prospectively followed for complications and patient-reported outcomes. Patients were categorized into two groups: those who received PMRT (n = 43) and those who did not (n = 59). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the BREAST-Q questionnaire, while complications were analyzed based on clinical records. Statistical analysis included logistic regression to identify factors associated with complications and patient satisfaction. The incidence of overall complications were significantly higher in the irradiated group (46.5%) compared to the unirradiated group (23.7%). PMRT was associated with a higher rate of fat necrosis (39.5% vs 8.5%) and flap fibrosis (9.3% vs 0%). The BREAST-Q scores for the physical well-being of the chest and satisfaction with breast reconstruction were significantly lower in the irradiated group. The psychosocial well-being scores did not differ between the two groups. Patients irradiated with the IMRT and VMAT techniques had lower complication rates and higher BREAST-Q scores compared to those treated with the 3D technique. While PMRT increases the risk of complications following autologous breast reconstruction, overall patient satisfaction remains high. The use of advanced radiotherapy techniques such as IMRT and VMAT may help mitigate some of the adverse effects associated with radiation therapy. Future research should focus on optimizing reconstruction techniques and refining patient selection criteria to enhance long-term outcomes.",

Quantitative determination of relative expression level of lncRNA-NEAT1 using the real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and evaluation of CD8 and PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression in 47 specimens of PTC tissue compared to 5 controls of normal thyroid tissue. The results were analyzed for their association with the clinicopathological parameters of the studied cases. Compared to control specimens, LncRNA-NEAT1 expression levels were considerably higher in PTC cases (p=0.000), and they were also significantly higher in patients with nodal metastases and lymphovascular emboli (LVE) (p=0.003 and 0.002 respectively). There were significant associations between PD-L1 positive expression and extra-thyroid extension (p=0.02), nodal metastasis (p=0.00), and LVE (p=0.00). In contrast, significant associations of increased CD8 expression with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (p=0.007), absent nodal metastasis (p=0.02), and negative LVE (p=0.01) were detected. There was a significant negative correlation between CD8 and PD-L1 expression levels (p=0.014). LncRNA-NEAT1 and PD-L1 expression levels are associated with more aggressive PTC. In contrast, high CD8 expression is associated with favorable parameters. These findings suggest the possible diagnostic and prognostic role of these biomarkers in PTC.",

    "abstract": "Ameloblastoma (AM) is a well-known benign odontogenic tumor recognized for its aggressive nature, believed to originate from tooth-forming tissue or the dental follicle (DF). Phosphoproteins are crucial for cellular signaling, enabling intracellular communication and regulating various physiological processes. In cancer, phosphoproteins are fundamental to both pathogenesis and pathophysiology. However, studies on phosphoproteins in AM are still limited. This study aimed to compare phosphoprotein profile and identify the crucial phosphoproteins between AM and DF. The phosphoprotein profiles of seven AM and five DF were discovered using mass spectrometry, and their associated phosphosites were examined by Netphos 3.1. Biological functions were analyzed by Metascape database. Thirteen significant phosphoproteins were found in AM, and six in DF, all of which have phosphorylation sites. For example, among the proteins uniquely identified in AM were SENP1 (Sentrin-specific protease 1), DDX42 (ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX42), LMBR1L (Protein LMBR1L), Cathepsin H (CATH), and Retinoblastoma-binding protein 5 (RBBP5), whereas those unique to DF included GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor (GCF), Plexin-C1 (PLXC1), and proline/serine-rich coiled-coil protein 1 (PSRC1), PTHD3 (Patched domain-containing protein 3), and TPC6B (Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 6B). For biological analysis, the enriched terms included processing of capped intron-containing pre-mRNA, signaling by rho GTPases, establishment of organelle localization, signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and cell morphogenesis. These phosphoproteomic findings provide essential insights into the pathogenesis of AM and warrant further investigation. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of AM biology and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the impact of prophylactic para-aortic lymph node (PALN) irradiation with extended-field radiotherapy (EF-RT) in individuals with locally advanced cervical cancer. The principal objective was overall survival (OS), whereas the secondary outcomes included PALN metastases, full remission, pelvic recurrence, distant metastasis, and mortality attributable to cervical cancer. A thorough search was performed in Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Science Direct in November 2023, following PRISMA procedures. Randomized trials comparing EF-RT to pelvic-only radiation for locally advanced cervical cancer without PALN involvement were incorporated. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software to evaluate the Hazard Ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and the Odds Ratio (OR) for additional outcomes. Six Randomized Controlled Trials involving 1,028 patients (508 in EF-RT group and 520 in pelvic-only radiotherapy group) were analyzed. EF-RT significantly reduced para-aortic lymph node metastases compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy (OR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.12;0.44], p-value<0.00001, 4 studies), but not significantly improve overall survival (HR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.82;1.16], p-value>0.05, 6 studies) nor other outcomes. EF-RT was also associated with increased gastrointestinal but not urological or gynecological complications. EF-RT as a prophylactic treatment for cervical cancer patients with negative PALN metastasis significantly reduces para-aortic lymph node metastatic events, nonetheless, it is improbable to offer any advantages regarding overall survival, managed pelvic illness, or distant metastatic sites. Furthermore, its adverse effects on gastrointestinal problems were observed to exceed those of conventional pelvic irradiation, necessitating further consideration.",

A validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (R² = 0.9983) was used to quantify rosuvastatin plasma levels. In vivo pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in Wistar rats following oral administration of rosuvastatin, M. charantia extract, and their combination. In vitro, HepG2 liver cancer cells were treated with rosuvastatin, M. charantia, and their combination to evaluate anticancer activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) were calculated to assess cytotoxic effects and interaction profiles. The IC₅₀ values were 231.7 µg/mL for M. charantia, 59.1 µg/mL for rosuvastatin, and 48.7 µg/mL for the combination, with an FIC index of 1.03, indicating additive effects. The combination enhanced anticancer efficacy by promoting apoptosis, modulating oxidative stress, and altering lipid and cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells. In vivo, co-administration of M. charantia significantly shortened rosuvastatin's half-life and increased its elimination rate, without affecting the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) or the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). These findings suggest that M. charantia may influence rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics and enhance its anticancer effects. The study supports the potential of combining natural products with conventional pharmaceuticals as adjunctive therapies in cancer treatment while highlighting the need for further clinical investigation.",

This study employed an approach that combined these drugs and examined their molecular mechanisms of action against cancer. This study evaluated the anticancer properties of the linagliptin-rivaroxaban mixture and its molecular anticancer mechanism by screening its ability to target the mutant MAPK-RAS kinase signal proteins. Following 24 and 72 hours of incubation, HeLa and human-derived adipose tissue (NHF) cell lines were utilized to investigate the anticancer and safety properties of a linagliptin-rivaroxaban mixture and cisplatin at concentrations between 0.1 and 1,000 µg/ml. A combination and selectivity index study assessed the potential synergistic effects between mixture ingredients and selective toxicity. Computational molecular docking simulations were employed to investigate the binding affinity of linagliptin and rivaroxaban to various mutant kinase signal proteins within the MAPK-RAS kinase pathway. The study results indicated that the combination of linagliptin and rivaroxaban significantly suppressed the growth of cervical cancer cells compared to the inhibitory effects of cisplatin, linagliptin, and rivaroxaban individually. Furthermore, the mixture cytotoxicity on the NHF cell line was significantly lower than that of cisplatin. The interaction between linagliptin and rivaroxaban exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity, as evidenced by the combination index score. The mixture exhibited selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells, suggesting a favorable toxicity index score. The outcomes of the molecular docking pilot study of diverse mutant MAPK-RAS kinase signal proteins with the mixture's ingredients are indicated. Linagliptin and rivaroxaban's best interactions were with mutant P38 MAPK and RAS kinase signal proteins, with docking scores of -7.9 kcal/mol and -8.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

Data were collected from 404 participants, comprising 202 pairs of breast cancer patients and their caregivers across Health Region 9 during six months from September 2024 to February 2025. Participants were recruited by the researcher, going to 10 areas in the region and personally visiting and obtaining formal permission from the appropriate health authorities. A questionnaire was developed and distributed through the primary care coordinators at the local health facilities, who served as intermediaries to explain the research objectives to participants and to coordinate data-collection schedules. All the patients were female with a mean age of 56.13 years. The majority of the caregivers were also female. Most caregivers were related to the patients, with the majority being the children or spouses. The average total cost of illness was USD 165.11 (95%CI: 119.44-210.78). Regarding the indirect costs, the average total costs for the patients and their caregivers were USD 80.10, with the highest proportion (at 48.52% of the total costs) accounted for by lost income due to leaving work due to sickness (USD 47.92 per month). This study shows that the economic impact of breast cancer treatment in a regional setting in Thailand was primarily due to productivity losses from missed work, which represents an indirect cost rather than a direct medical expense.",

To increase the sensitivity and specificity to the highest degree, in this report we further improved this modified LFIA by using a new antibody combination, which includes a biotinylated home-made chicken antibody and a nano-gold conjugated rabbit antibody (MBS416853). A calibration curve was established from two recombinant METCAM/MUC18 proteins (C-terminus GST as the positive control and NM-GST the negative control) and used for determining METCAM/MUC18 concentrations in 36 serum specimens from normal individuals and patients of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) patients, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and prostate cancer at various Gleason scores and after treatment. The data obtained were much better than the previously modified LFIA, traditional LFIA, and PSA test. Serum METCAM/MUC18 concentrations were higher in pre-malignant PIN patients than prostate cancer patients and both were higher than normal individuals, BPH patients, and treated patients. Serum METCAM/MUC18 concentrations were directly proportional to most serum PSA concentrations. The elevated serum METCAM/MUC18 concentration suggest that METCAM/MUC18 may be used as a novel biomarker for predicting the malignant potential of prostate cancer at the early premalignant (PIN) stage. Since METCAM/MUC18 could also drive the spreading of prostate cancer cells, METCAM/MUC18 may be a therapeutic target for the cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia refers to reduced oxygen levels in tumor tissues, and the transcription factors of cellular response to hypoxia are hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Although the altered expression of HIFs has been identified in many malignancies, their role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still debatable. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are part of the tumor microenvironment; however, the effects of hypoxia on CAFs require further investigation. This observational study aimed to evaluate the HIF -1α and HIF - 2α expression in OSCC compared to normal oral mucosal tissues (NOM) using immunohistochemistry. Further, the study aimed to analyze the association of 1α and 2α isotypes of HIF with the clinicopathologic features of OSCC and their relationship with CAFs in tumor tissues. Immunostaining of HIF -1α and HIF - 2α, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α- SMA; as a marker for CAFs) was performed on 50 OSCC and 50 NOM samples. Analysis of variance, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the data. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. HIF -1α and HIF - 2α, and α-SMA expressions were significantly higher in OSCC samples than in NOM (P < 0.001). The expressions of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were higher in histologically more differentiated tumor cells; however, the association with histologic grading was not significant. α-SMA exhibited a positive correlation with the expression of 1α and 2α isotypes of HIF. The elevated nuclear and stromal immunostaining of HIFs in OSCC substantiates their role in the pathogenesis of OSCC. The correlation between HIFs and α-SMA indicates an influence of hypoxia in inducing CAFs in oral cancer.",

This gap reduces the practical relevance of research findings in shaping policies and strategies for palliative care tailored to Vietnam's healthcare system. This study aimed to assess health outcomes in cancer patients receiving palliative care over a one-year period using the APCA African Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS). The prospective cohort study was conducted over one year, with monthly interviews using IPOS scale to measure patient health outcomes. A multilevel linear mixed model was used to analyze changes in IPOS scores over time, and a Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons test was applied to compare mean IPOS scores of patients before death. Among the 134 patients included, mean IPOS scores along with physical, emotional, and communication symptoms decreased over time. The total IPOS score declined from 32.2 (95% CI: 30.3-34.1) to 11.4 (95% CI: 9.6-13.3) after one year, with the greatest reduction observed in physical symptoms. Patients in the 0-2 months before death group had significantly higher scores than those in the 3-5 months and 6 months before death groups. Physical symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, and weakness, worsened the most, while communication issues remained stable, peaking at 2 months and reaching their lowest point at 6 months before death. This study provides evidence of the benefits of palliative care in improving the health of cancer patients.

Liposomes are well-known for their ability to improve the biological activity of encapsulated drugs, making them a promising candidate for targeted therapies, particularly in oral cancer treatment. Biosynthesised SeNPs were incorporated into liposomes via the thin-film hydration technique. Particle size and zeta potential were quantified by dynamic light scattering (DLS), whereas encapsulation efficiency (EE) was determined spectrophotometrically (UV-Vis). The physicochemical properties of the liposome-loaded SeNPs were characterized, revealing an average size of 270 nm, spherical morphology, and an encapsulation efficiency of 50.5%. The release profile of SeNPs from the liposomes demonstrated a controlled release of 61% over 64 hours, while free SeNPs released 100% of their content during the same period. The antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of both free and liposome-loaded SeNPs were tested against standard pathogenic bacterial strains, with the liposome formulation showing enhanced efficacy. The cytotoxicity assay revealed that liposome-loaded SeNPs exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic effects on oral cells compared to free SeNPs, indicating improved therapeutic potential. The study demonstrates that liposome-loaded SeNPs are an effective and biocompatible drug delivery system with notable antibacterial, anti-biofilm, and anticancer properties, making them a promising candidate for targeted drug delivery in oral cancer therapy.",

One of the methods for causal inference, the doubly robust estimator, is easy to apply with complete data, but becomes complex with incomplete or censored data. To overcome these challenges, we used pseudo-observations. This historical cohort study included 602 patients residing in the provinces of Mazandaran and Golestan. The patients were followed up over a period of approximately 11 years. To evaluate the effects of surgical, radiotherapeutic, and chemotherapeutic treatments on survival, we used inverse probability weighting and the doubly robust estimator using pseudo-observations. The survival and pseudo packages of the R software were used for model fitting. The efficacy of the doubly robust estimator and inverse probability weighting was assessed by comparing survival estimates derived from both methods across different treatment types. In this study, there were 441 cases (73.26%) of deaths from gastrointestinal cancer. Our analysis included three time points: the first year, the eighth year and the fifteenth year. The results showed that the survival of patients with gastrointestinal cancer varied depending on the treatment method. In particular, surgical treatment showed a significant impact on survival at all three time points. In contrast, radiotherapy only showed a significant correlation at the first time point, while no significance was found at the two subsequent time points. A significant correlation was found for chemotherapy at all three time points. Using a doubly robust estimator with pseudo-observations is more efficient and simpler. Causal inference methods can serve as evaluation tools for different treatments in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.",

    "title": "Interleukin-13 (rs20541 A/G) Gene Polymorphism and Chance of Acquiring Hepatitis B in the Egyptian Population.",
    "abstract": "An important worldwide health concern is infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), especially in underdeveloped nations. Gene polymorphisms encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can influence how an HBV infection presents clinically. As mediators, cytokines play important functions in the immunological and inflammatory systems. A strong pleiotropic cytokine is interleukin-13 (IL-13). The research attempts to look into the relationship between HBV infection in Egyptians and variations in a single nucleotide in the IL-13 (rs20541 A/G) gene. One hundred and twelve hepatitis B cases and fifty control subjects were involved in the investigation. Utilizing an allelic discrimination test pre-validated TaqMan™ MGB probe (Applied Biosystem). To investigate the relationship between the SNP of (IL-13) (rs 20541 A/G) gene and HBV, we used real-time PCR. The IL13 (rs20541 A/G) gene polymorphism study identified more frequent occurrences of the A/G and A/A genotypes among the patients (OR = {62.536, 21.25}, CI = {[19.276-202.889], [3.055-147.8]}, P = {0.0001, 0.002}). In the patient group, the A allele frequency was markedly different from the control group's (CI = 2.614-8.229, OR = 4.638, P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the current investigation did not find a connection between HBV fibrosis and the gene polymorphism of IL-13(rs 20541 A/G). The rs20541 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL-13 gene is linked to an increased risk of HBV.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine and explain genetic expression, important genetic markers, and how the immune system interacts with tumors in the advanced stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We obtained datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database consisting of 135 HCC patients. Datasets containing at least 100 significant genes determined by volcano plot analysis were utilized. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by GEO2R. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built by STRING and Cytoscape. Crucial genes were determined by Network Analyzer and CytoHubba based on four centrality parameters (degree, betweenness, closeness, stress). Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome enrichment analyses were performed to explore the underlying biochemical processes and tumor-immune interaction. We obtained 3,314 DEGs from two datasets, 75 of which overlapped. The STRING database recognized 63 genes to form PPI (p-value=0.0143). Among them, 13 genes were determined as crucial gene candidates. The action map revealed a significant interaction between 11 of them. Gene enrichment (p-value <0.05) showed biochemical processes involving crucial genes related to advanced-stage HCC, including antioxidant activity, longevity regulating pathways, and reduced oxidized thioredoxin. After enrichment analysis, TXNRD1 and NQO1 were identified as the most crucial genes and may serve as biomarkers and be involved in treatment strategies for patients with advanced-stage liver cancer. Both genes also showed a positive correlation with neutrophil infiltration (p-value <0.001). TXNRD1, NQO1, and their related pathways showed potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for advanced-stage HCC.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of binary skin lesion classification by optimizing the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). This involves fine-tuning key hyperparameters such as learning rate, weights, and biases to improve predictive performance. This study compares five CNN architectures: AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, Resnet 50, and WOA-optimized Resnet 50. The dataset comprises 3,600 balanced images (224×244 resolution) of skin moles, evenly divided into 1,800 benign and 1,800 malignant cases.  The models were trained on an open-access dermoscopic dataset to categorize skin lesions.  WOA was applied to optimize Resnet 50's hyperparameters weight and bias learning rate. Model performance was analysed using accuracy, preci-sion, recall, F1 score, specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), log loss, AUC-ROC, and infer-ence time. The confusion matrix was analyzed to assess misclassification rates.  Result: The WOA-optimized Resnet 50 outperformed all other models, achieving 98.29% accuracy, higher than standard Resnet 50 (90.13%), GoogleNet (87.1%), AlexNet (86.53%), and VGG16 (81.18%). It also demonstrated superior recall (99.31%), specificity (97.07%), and an AUC-ROC of 99.84%, indicating excellent classification capability. The MCC score (0.9657) confirmed strong predictive reliability. Addi-tionally, the optimized model achieved the lowest log loss (0.0512), ensuring high confidence in predictions. With an inference time of 0.1488 seconds, it was significantly faster than standard Resnet 50 (1.029 seconds), making it computationally efficient. The confusion matrix confirmed its reliability, showing min-imal false positives (7) and false negatives (2). WOA-optimized Resnet 50 significantly improves accuracy, recall, specificity, and computational efficiency for binary skin lesion classification. Compared to traditional deep learning models, it offers superior predictive performance while maintaining fast inference time. These findings suggest that WOA-enhanced deep learning can enhance dermatological diagnostics, aiding early detection and clinical decision-making. Future research may explore its application for multi-class skin lesion classification and real-time medical imaging systems.",

    "title": "A Case-Control Study on Combined Effects of Base Excision Repair and Nucleotide Excision Repair Gene Polymorphisms in Gastrointestinal Cancer Susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer constitute a major global health problem influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variations within base excision repair (BER and) nucleotide exchange repair (NER) pathway genes can impact DNA repair capacity. Investigating the combined effects of BER and NER pathway genes offers a promising avenue for understanding their impact on cancer susceptibility. This study was aimed to address combined effects of genetic variants in BER and NER on the risk of developing GI cancer. Genetic polymorphisms within BER and NER genes were examined in two hundred histologically confirmed GI cancer cases, along with equal number of controls by the PCR-RFLP technique. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI and associated p-values were computed to assess an extent of association of these polymorphisms with GI cancer susceptibility, with statistical significance established at p ≤0.005. Regression analysis revealed compelling evidence of synergistic effects between specific variant genotypes. Notably, combinations involving variants of XPG (rs17655) and XRCC1 (rs1799782) (OR=2.20; 95% CI: 1.02-4.72; p=0.042) and  XRCC1 (rs25487) (OR=2.56; 95% CI: 1.39-4.72; p=0.002) as well as XPD (rs238406) and XRCC1 (rs1799782) (OR=3.02; 95% CI: 1.60-5.70; p=0.0006) and XCC1 (rs25487)  (OR=6.63; 95% CI: 3.63-12.10; p=0.0001) exhibited significant associations with increased GI cancer risk within the study population. These findings suggested combined influence of SNPs within XRCC1, XRCC3, and APE1, in combination with polymorphisms of XPC and XPD, on the development of GI cancer. Nonetheless, further investigations on larger scale are warranted to validate and expand upon these observations.",

    "abstract": "Ursolic acid (UA) has been proven to inhibit various cancer signaling pathways; however, the involvement of UA in overcoming tamoxifen resistance remains unclear and needs further investigation. This study aims to discover the potential gene targets and explore how ursolic acid interacts with those genes to restore sensitivity to tamoxifen. Analyzing gene expression data from GeneCards and Swisstargetprediction for UA related genes, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for tamoxifen resistance genes. DEGs were analyzed for functional annotation and molecular pathways using DAVID v6.8, continued with constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to highlight crucial genes associated with tamoxifen resistance using STRING-DB and Cytoscape. Genetic alteration analysis using cBioportal for target validation and consideration. Molecular docking was done using Autodock4 and PyMoL for visualisation. The KEGG pathway and PPI network suggest that MDM2, STAT3, TGFB1, and MAPK1 were indicated as potential target genes of UA. Genetic alteration analysis further confirms that MDM2 has the highest alteration, which becomes potentially targeted by UA. Molecular docking analysis confirms that UA can target MDM2 by targeting the N-terminus site on 4HBM and 5ZXF structure. The binding energy of UA is -5.36 for 4HBM and -8.71 for 5ZXF, with all RMSD values below 2. This result shows that UA has a lower docking score than the native ligand for the 5ZXF structure. Additionally, MDM2 is mainly involved in the PI3K-Akt pathway, which plays a role in the chemotherapy resistance mechanism. MDM2 has become a potential target for UA to reverse the tamoxifen resistance mechanism in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study are to optimize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a predictive modality for therapy response in advanced-stage cervical cancer and to identify predictors of this response in relation to survivin expression. This case-control study was conducted from January 2023 to May 2024, with total 35 subjects. The target population comprised patients with stages IIB to IIIC2 (FIGO 2018) cervical cancer. MR examination was performed three times: pre therapy, in the mid cycle of external radiation (20-30Gy), and 2 months after complete therapy. The study analyzed relations between age, tumor size, nodal metastasis, ADC and T2 parameters on MR, and survivin levels, with final therapeutic response. The predictive model for final therapy response was developed using four variables: patient age, tumor size, nodal metastasis, and the T2 tumor-to-muscle ratio on MRI #2. The scoring system showed the minimum total score was 0 and the maximum total score was 6. The cut-off score on this predictive model is score 3 to differentiate between the prediction of good or poor response with the sensitivity of 92,86% and a specificity of 85,71%. This study found that T2 tumor-to-muscle ratio (T2 t/m ratio) on MR in the mid-cycle external radiation is a potential predictive factor of final therapy response on advanced-stage cervical cancer. A predictive model for assessing the final response could effectively incorporate clinical and MR parameters, including patient age, tumor size, nodal metastasis findings on MR, and Ratio T2 t/m on MR in the mid-cycle external radiation.",

We retrieved ALL deaths from the mortality databases of Ecuador and Peru. Age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were estimated. Mortality trends were evaluated by country, and sex, between 2005 and 2020 with Joinpoint regression analyses. Between 2016 and 2020, Ecuador and Peru reported a mortality rate of 1.7 for boys and 1.2 for girls 0-14 years of age. The Coastal region had the highest mortality rate in this period for both age groups, and the Rainforest had the lowest rates. Only Peru showed a significant increase in both sexes, with large increases for boys in the Highlands (+17.6% annually) and girls in Lima (+13.3% annually). Our findings suggest considerable increases in ALL mortality in Peru. It is important to implement public health strategies for early diagnosis and timely treatment of children with ALL in Peru.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming, especially lipid reprogramming, is critical in cancer progression, including prostate cancer (PCa). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used to slow down tumor spread and Lipid metabolism has been linked to its resistance in PCa. This study examines the therapeutic potential of Matairesinol (MA), a plant-derived lignan, in targeting lipid reprogramming in PCa cells. PC-3 cells were treated with different doses of MA and its effect was studied on cell growth and induction of apoptosis by trypan blue dye exclusion and JC-1 dye assays, respectively. The altered expression of de novo fatty acid, cholesterol biosynthesis and other associated genes were evaluated by qPCR. Changes in intracellular lipid accumulation were assessed by Nile red staining. The bioinformatics approach was used to identify the main targets of MA using DrugBank, PubChem, and BindingDB databases, and molecular docking was performed with Autodock 4.2 to predict the binding of MA. MA significantly impaired PCa cell growth and mitochondrial membrane potential, inducing apoptosis. MA modulated mRNA expression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid transport, and lipolysis-related genes, and reduced lipid accumulation. Bioinformatics analysis with DrugBank, PubChem, and BindingDB revealed the main targets of MA; and molecular docking with AutoDock 4.2 predicted MA binding and identified SHBG and DHRS4L2 as potential targets. In vitro validation confirmed that MA significantly reduced mRNA levels of SHBG and DHRS4L2 in PC-3 cell line. By targeting lipid metabolism, MA holds promising potential as a therapeutic agent for PCa, especially in ADT-resistant and Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) cases.",

Although risk factors for these two types of liver cancer have been identified, gaps persist in models for prevention. This qualitative study examined community awareness of liver cancer risk factors and prevention in rural Thailand. Qualitative interviews were conducted with two groups from two villages in the north of Thailand. Village A (5 participants) has a high prevalence of CCA, while Village B (10 participants) has low prevalence. Open-ended questions were asked about social structures, farming practices, drinking water, diet, health care, and attitudes towards health promotion. Responses were tabulated and common themes were discerned, then stratified by village to examine their similarities and differences. In Village A, respondents were ethnic Thai with large families engaged in low-income farming and applying pesticides in unsafe manners. Village B was populated by the Mian ethnic group, where family sizes were smaller and higher incomes were derived from cash crops like coffee. Risky pesticide application practices were commonly reported. Diets were similar, except for intakes of freshwater crabs and crab paste in Village A (absent in Village B). However, the crabs had potentially high contamination of pesticide residues. Village A relied on surface water contaminated with pesticide runoff, in contrast to Village B that was upstream of point-source contamination. Furthermore, Village B emphasized healthy lifestyles and promoted the overall health of the community, supported by a network of social workers. Very few people there had ever experienced cancer. In contrast, Village A suffered from many liver cancer deaths and lacked a social worker network. These results inform community-tailored interventions in Thailand to promote safer pesticide practices, healthier diets, safer drinking water, and supportive community health for CCA prevention.",

This study also examines locating smoke advertising installation points around the observation area. This study employs a qualitative approach with a purposive sampling method to select 200 representative locations for observation and 11 informants to assess compliance with Perda KTR between August and September 2023. We evaluated the location regarding the criteria \"No Smoking Area\" signs, clear \"No Smoking\" signs, penalties for violators, presence of cigarette butts, designated smoking areas, and tobacco product promotion. The analysis was based on descriptive compliance analyses and  QGIS was used to map the distribution of observation locations and tobacco advertising. Only 15 of the 200 locations (7,5%) fully complied with the Perda KTR. Healthcare facilities had the highest compliance (40%), followed by educational institutions (33%), while worship places, public transport, and sport facilities showed 6-7% compliance. About 92,5% of \"No Smoking\" signs lacked enforcement sanctions, and cigarette butts were found in 43,5% of locations. Additionally, 14,5% of stites showed visible tobacco advertisements, especially in the central district (Wua-Wua, Kadia, Kambu). Mandonga, Puuwatu, and Abeli have fewer observed tobacco advertisements, which may reflect different enforcement levels or commercial activity. Interviews revealed moderate public awareness but highlighted significant enforcement gaps. The smoke-free zone policy in Kendari has not been effectively implemented. Structural, cultural, and economic factors, limited signage, and weak enforcement contribute to low compliance. Strengthened policy dissemination and enforcement are essential to improving public adherence.",

A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among women aged 21-55 years attending outpatient departments of obstetrics and gynecology. The study employed purposive sampling and utilized a pre-validated questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21, with bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression to identify predictors of good knowledge. The survey involved 370 women, revealing profound gaps in knowledge about CC, with 84.7% demonstrating poor understanding. A significant association was found between education, occupation, income, and knowledge of CC. Furthermore, nearly all respondents expressed a desire for more information on CC and preventive measures, with electronic social media identified as the preferred awareness-raising channel. Encouragingly, 99.7% of women showed willingness towards receiving HPV vaccination if provided free or at low cost. The findings underscore a critical need for enhanced awareness and educational interventions to bridge the knowledge gap on CC screening and prevention among Pakistani women. Despite high willingness to engage in preventive practices, barriers such as lack of awareness, limited healthcare access, and socioeconomic factors hinder effective screening uptake. Advocacy and tailored health campaigns are crucial for mobilizing resources and political support to combat CC in Pakistan.",

After formulation of PICO, comprehensive searches of literatures were done including all randomized controlled studies that reported the second-line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancers' subjects who have failed with first-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The outcomes analyzed were response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. Data were collected and analysis will be done based on Bayesian method using BUGSnet package in R studio. Eleven eligible RCTs were included in this NMA with 1228 subjects and 15 different second-line therapies. The NMA was conducted in random-effects, consistent, and convergence model. Most studies reported the use of fluoropyrimidine-based regimen, either alone or in combination with others drugs. The combination of 5FU-LV with liposomal irinotecan showed the most favorable outcomes, the highest response rate, longest overall survival, and longest progression-free survival. However, this regimen had highest adverse events among others. The next promising regimen was combination of oral capecitabine with varlitinib, with favorable response rate (RR 16.67; 95%CI 0.01 to 21.39), overall survival (HR 0.09; 95%CI -5.22 to 5.37), and progression-free survival (HR 1.37; 95%CI -58.4 to 62.15). The serious adverse events were reported less than others. The combination of oral capecitabine with varlitinib could be a promising second-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer refractory to gemcitabine-based first-line regimen.",

    "abstract": "In Morocco, Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In most cases, the disease is confirmed at an advanced stage. Delays in the presentation, diagnosis, and access to treatment for breast cancer significantly increase mortality and morbidity. This review aimed to identify the factors influencing patient and system delays in Moroccan women with breast cancer. A systematic review was conducted exploring three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) using predefined Keywords related to breast cancer presentation and diagnosis. Additionally, the reference lists of pertinent papers were manually checked. The quality of papers selected was assessed using specific checklists, according to the study design. We conducted a qualitative synthesis using thematic analysis to compile the findings. The review includes 7 studies that identified 45 barriers that could affect the patient and systems delay among women with breast cancer. The main factors cited were largely associated with healthcare accessibility, notably high costs, and geographical challenges, along with a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding breast cancer. Policymakers in Morocco should prioritize improving accessibility to the healthcare system in all its aspects-financial, geographical, and patient pathways and take decisive actions to enhance awareness and knowledge about breast cancer and promote breast cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and management are essential. In this case, you can use screening methods such as pap smear, visual acetic acid inspection, and HPV DNA test. Healthcare professionals recommend the Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) test for finding precancerous lesions. This is especially useful in resource-limited settings. This scoping review explored methods to increase cervical cancer screening for women. It focused on the use of the VIA test. We did a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and ProQuest. We used these keywords: (uptake OR participation) AND (\"visual inspection acetic acid\" OR VIA) AND (\"cervical cancer\" OR \"uterine cervical neoplasm\"). We used the EndNote app to manage data. First, we screened titles and abstracts. Then, we identified potential articles and checked the full text. We looked for non-relevant outcomes, insufficient data, and duplicate publications. We followed the Prisma framework throughout the process. Two reviewers selected and extracted the data. A total of 39 studies were found to be assessing methods to increase VIA. Research reveals 6 ways to enhance cervical cancer screening using the VIA method worldwide. The six emerging themes for these intervention types include: health education and counselling (n=53%), cancer screening programs (n=12%), technology-driven interventions (n=10%), community and peer-based approaches (n=16%), cultural and language-specific approaches (n=4%), as well as training and capacity building (n=4%). Health education and counseling increase awareness about cervical cancer screening for women. This is especially true in countries with limited resources. The main interventions obtained from this study were health education and counseling. Future screening should use digital health tools like mHealth. It should also boost community-based methods. Finally, interventions need to fit cultural and language needs. This way, we can increase participation rates.",

    "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, designed to target tumor-specific mutations unique to individual patients. By stimulating a tailored immune response, these vaccines aim to enhance antitumor immunity while minimizing off-target effects. However, cancer is a complex disease, and single-modality treatments often face challenges such as immune evasion and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, personalized cancer vaccines are increasingly being explored in combination with other therapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine therapies, oncolytic viruses, and traditional chemotherapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of personalized cancer vaccines, focusing on their development, clinical trials, and early outcomes. It also discusses the synergistic potential of combination therapies, offering insights into how these strategies could overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and improve patient outcomes. Finally, we explore future prospects, addressing challenges such as vaccine production, patient selection, and regulatory frameworks to outline the path forward for the successful integration of personalized vaccines into standard oncological care.",

We conducted a comprehensive search in databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for relevant articles published until January 8, 2025. We combined individual data to estimate the overall hazard ratio (HR) for cancer prognosis. Additionally, We assessed the relationships between SNHG22 expression levels and patient characteristics using the odds ratio (OR). Nine studies involving 779 patients participated in the analysis. Patients with SNHG22 overexpression exhibited poorer overall survival (HR=2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.98-3.01, I2=0%) and recurrence-free survival (HR=2.60, 95%CI: 1.69-4.00, I2=0%) compared to those with lower levels.

    "abstract": "The GABAergic system, commonly known as the inhibitory system in the central nervous system, also plays a crucial role in cancer development. This article reviews the complex interactions between the GABAergic system and tumor progression, emphasizing the GAD2, GABRG2, and CACNA1G genes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to assess current evidence regarding the involvement of GAD2, GABRG2, and CACNA1G genes in promoting cancer development through enhanced tumor growth, cell survival, and increased intracellular calcium levels. While GABA generally suppresses neural activity, it can paradoxically promote cell proliferation and survival in cancer cells. The GAD2 gene produces an enzyme that helps create GABA. Higher levels of GAD2 expression have been linked to tumor growth and survival in several types of cancer. The GABRG2 gene encodes a subunit of the GABA-A receptor. When this receptor is activated, it can cause depolarization and activate signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth. The CACNA1G gene encodes a subunit of a calcium channel that controls calcium ion entry into cells. Higher levels of CACNA1G expression are frequently found in various cancers, contributing to tumor development by increasing intracellular calcium levels. This article examines the role of GAD2, GABRG2, and CACNA1G genes in cancer progression, highlighting their interactions in promoting tumor growth and survival. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GABA signaling, its receptors, and the associated genes in cancer could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of more effective treatments. Further research is essential to elucidate the detailed mechanisms driving cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of technology and medicine has allowed for a considerable number of alternatives for treating medical issues, particularly those requiring invasive surgery. Thyroid nodules consisting of abnormal benign tissue are conventionally managed with surgery (lobectomy); however, advancements have introduced radiofrequency ablation as a method to manage these nodules. The two interventions have shown similar efficacies and no conclusive determination has been reported that proves which method (if any) has the lower recurrence rate. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to fill this information gap. Articles were selected based on eligible criteria and the PRISMA algorithm using the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Europe PMC and the PICO terms \"radiofrequency ablation\", \"lobectomy\", \"benign thyroid nodule\", and \"recurrences\". Eligible studies were subsequently assessed using the risk bias criteria of the Quality Appraisal of Case Series Studies Checklist and processed with the BUGSnet package in R studio. The results were presented in Funnel and Forest plots. Of the 18 eligible studies, 14 involved radiofrequency ablation and 5 involved lobectomies. The recurrence rate using the lobectomy procedure was 11 % (95 % CI, 2-40 %), whereas that with radiofrequency ablation was 4 % (95 % CI, 2-10 %)(p-value < 0.05). Both intervention populations showed high heterogeneity (I2>60 %). The recurrence rate of radiofrequency ablation was lower compared to that of lobectomy; however, the high heterogeneity, low sample numbers, lack of direct comparison, and homogeneous design of the studies suggest that further testing is required to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "To gain molecular and mechanistic insights into initiation of the RAS-RAF signaling cascade we developed and used a combination of multiscale simulation and experimental approaches. The influence and impact of the membrane on RAS and RAF proteins is a factor we are just beginning to understand and appreciate in more detail. Molecular simulation is an ideal methodology to further study this complicated relationship between the membrane and associated proteins. Our previous work using MuMMI (Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure) investigated different lipid compositions solely around the KRAS4b protein and the interplay between protein behavior and these membrane environments. MuMMI uses machine learning to couple adjacent simulation scales and has been efficiently scaled across some of the world's largest high-performance computers. Recently, we have expanded this multi-resolution framework to include the all-atom simulation scale, and to incorporate the RAF RBDCRD domains. Here we present the overall analysis results from this new simulation campaign comprising a mixture of RAS and RAF RBDCRD proteins. Approximately 35,000 coarse-grained, and 10,000 all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were completed, sampled from a variety of protein/lipid composition configurations that were generated from a micron-scale continuum simulation containing hundreds of copies of the proteins. Our studies suggest that orientations of the RAS-RBDCRD complex on the membrane occupy distinct configurational states and the spatial patterns of lipid arrangements around these different protein states are unique to each state. The extent, and size of lipid 'fingerprints' imposed on the membrane by the RAS-RBDCRD protein complex is significantly larger than observed for just the RAS protein on its own. These protein complexes strongly associate but we do not observe statistically significant preferred protein-protein orientations. These observations indicate that spatial co-localization of RAS-RBDCRD proteins in the same vicinity may be assisted by specific membrane environments, acting to increase the probability of signaling complex formation.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization is the primary biomarker assay employed to infer Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) involvement in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, discordance between EBER status and EBV DNA detection has been observed in certain NPC patients. This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of EBER and EBV DNA status. A total of 2,942 NPC patients with known EBV status, treated at our center between 2016 and 2022, were included in this analysis. Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between patients who had EBER-negative versus EBER-positive and who were matched in a 1:4 ratio. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival data. The association between EBER-EBV DNA status and survival outcomes was assessed using multivariable analysis. Among the cohort, 51 patients (1.7%) were EBER-negative, while 2,891 patients (98.3%) were EBER-positive. EBV-negative NPC was significantly associated with the keratinizing subtype (15.7% vs. 0.3%, P < 0.001). EBER-negative patients exhibited a higher propensity for locoregional recurrence compared to their EBER-positive counterparts, with a 5-year locoregional failure-free survival rate of 76.5% (95% CI, 63.3%-92.5%) versus 86.8% (95% CI, 85.0%-88.6%), respectively (P = 0.012). Multivariable analysis further identified a significant association between double-negative status (EBER-/EBV DNA-) and an increased risk of locoregional recurrence (HR: 4.368, 95% CI, 2.058-9.269, P < 0.001), compared to the double-positive one. These associations remained robust after adjustment for confounding factors and in repeated analyses of the matched cohort. This study highlights the potential prognostic value of EBER and EBV DNA combinations in NPC. However, given the limited number of EBV-negative cases, further investigations are warranted to substantiate these findings.",

Subsequently, six models were constructed: one clinical model, four habitat models (habitats 1, 2, 3, and whole-tumor), and one combined model. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the models' ability to predict PNI. The four habitat models exhibited robust performance in predicting PNI, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.862-0.935, 0.802-0.957, and 0.859-0.939 in the training, in-vad, and ex-vad cohorts, respectively.

    "abstract": "Liquid biopsy assays using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can revolutionize care for children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors by enabling precise monitoring of therapeutic responses and detecting recurrence or measurable residual disease (MRD). These assays can detect cell-free, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) via somatic alterations, though accurately measuring low-abundance ctDNA in CSF is challenging. Our research focused on the optimization of next-generation sequencing library preparation from cell-free DNA (cfDNA), evaluating four commercial kits to address the low nucleic acid yield in CSF-derived cfDNA. The selected kit minimized false positives and detected somatic variants at 5% variant allele frequency using 0.1 ng input of synthetic cfDNA, suitable for low-volume CSF samples. We then applied our optimized workflow to six children with CNS tumors using a personalized hybrid-capture sequencing strategy (\"MRD4U\"), in which individualized panels were designed based on each patient's tumor sequencing. Using MRD4U, we identified ctDNA in two samples, even though neither patient had radiographic or clinical evidence of disease at the time of liquid biopsy. Notably, one ctDNA-positive patient developed radiographic recurrence four months later, demonstrating the assay's potential to detect molecular relapse ahead of conventional clinical measures. These findings demonstrate applicability of our personalized MRD4U assay in early detection of disease recurrence. Unlike non-targeted or tumor-agnostic CSF liquid biopsy approaches, MRD4U leverages patient-specific genomic information to enable sensitive, tumor-informed monitoring that can be deployed across a wide range of pediatric CNS tumors. Our approach is broadly applicable to any tumor type with existing genomic data, enabling ctDNA detection across diverse diagnoses. Ultimately, this strategy may inform clinical decision-making and enable earlier therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on immunotherapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a disease that accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC, over 70% of cases ultimately exhibit primary or acquired resistance, underscoring the urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms. The review categorizes resistance into tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic processes and provides an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how factors such as tumor antigen loss, impaired antigen presentation, cGAS-STING pathway dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell exhaustion, and microbiomes collectively contribute to immune escape. In parallel, the influence of the lung and gut microbiome on shaping immunotherapy responses is discussed, with emphasis on microbial dysbiosis, immunosuppressive metabolite production, and TME remodeling. Therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance are also discussed, including combination approaches involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antiangiogenic agents, as well as epigenetic modulators (HDAC and BET inhibitors). Moreover, the review explores bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and small-molecule agents that enhance T cell function or disrupt immunosuppressive signaling networks. By integrating insights from preclinical models and clinical trials, the review underscores the necessity of biomarker-guided patient stratification, combination immunotherapy approaches, and interventions that restore tumor immunogenicity. It concludes that a multipronged therapeutic strategy, one that addresses both immune evasion and TME-induced suppression, holds the greatest promise for improving response durability and advancing personalized immunotherapy for NSCLC.",

The clinical and radiological information of 9 patients with H3F3B-mutant DMG were retrospectively collected. Tumor specimens underwent DNA methylation profiling and next-generation sequencing. All tumors harbored somatic H3F3B p.K27I mutation. Average patient age was 46 ± 6.86 years, 6 tumors located in spinal cord, 5 tumors involved brainstem and 2 arose in the thalamus. Immunohistochemistry showed these tumors exhibited completely or mosaic-like loss of H3K27me3 expression. Unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis of DNA methylation profiles showed that H3F3B-mutant DMGs formed a unique methylation cluster separate from other gliomas with H3K27me3 loss and DMGs with canonical histone H3 mutation. PPM1D and NF1 were frequently mutated in H3F3B-mutant DMGs. Survival analysis showed that H3F3B-mutant DMGs had poor prognosis comparable to H3K27M-mutant DMGs.

Through multivalent molecular interactions, biomolecular phase separation contributes to the formation of condensates that mediate the assembly of membraneless organelles, coordination of signaling pathways, and transcriptional programs. Under physiological conditions, condensation contributes to the maintenance of gene expression homeostasis, stress adaptation, and metabolic balance. In cancer cells, however, biomolecular condensates (BMCs) often exhibit aberrant behavior, accompanied by alterations in their structure, components, and regulatory mechanisms. Such perturbations may disrupt cellular homeostasis and influence key biological processes including gene regulation, signal transduction, metabolic reprogramming, and immune responses, thereby modulating various cancer hallmarks. Although the mechanistic understanding of BMCs remains incomplete, their intrinsic plasticity and environmental sensitivity make them attractive therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.

A retrospective review was conducted on treatment-naïve HCC patients who underwent curative resection between 2004 and 2019 at four tertiary hospitals in South Korea. The cohort of 1,069 patients was divided into a derivation cohort (n = 683) and a validation cohort (n = 386) based on participating institutions. In the derivation cohort, the mean age was 59.8 years, and 85.7% were male. The majority of patients (98.7%) had compensated liver cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis B was the prevalent etiology (72.9%). EHR developed in 107 patients (15.7%) and was associated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and histological features including larger tumor size, a higher number of tumors, the presence of microvascular invasion, serosal nvasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and necrosis. According to multivariable Cox regression analyses, younger age, a higher modified Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage, exceeding the Milan criteria, and an albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade ≥ 2 were independently significant preoperative factors associated with EHR.

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of a pre-metastatic niche (PMN) is the infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages, while the mechanism remains largely uncharted. Here, we reveal that cancer-associated fibroblasts-derived exosomes (CAF-exo) polarize macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype through encapsulating Gremlin-1 (GREM1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CAF and normal fibroblasts (NF) were extracted from NSCLC patients, and the exosomes produced were extracted. The effects of NF- or CAF-derived exosomes on the expression of PMN-associated markers and macrophage M2 polarization markers in mouse lung and liver tissues were compared. CAF-exo-mediated macrophage phenotypic switching and immunosuppressive effects on T cells were studied in vitro. Orthotopic lung tumors were formed in mice using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, followed by CAF-exo treatment. CAF-exo with GREM1 knockdown were used to treat macrophages or the LLC model mice. Finally, the reciprocal regulation between GREM1 and FGF4/SHH in macrophages was revealed, and rescue experiments were conducted. Intravenous injection of CAF-exo induced an immunosuppressive phenotype of macrophages in lung and liver tissues, leading to PMN formation. Tumor progression promoted by CAF-exo was blocked by knocking down GREM1 in CAF-exo. CAF-exo-derived GREM1 activated FGF4/SHH signaling in macrophages, and knockdown of FGF4/SHH inhibited macrophage M2 polarization. Ectopic expression of SHH or FGF4 activated GREM1/FGF4/SHH signaling and rescued the anti-tumor effects of GREM1 knockdown in vivo. CAF-exo activated the positive feedback regulation of FGF4/SHH and GREM1 in macrophages by carrying GREM1, leading to the switch of macrophages to an immunosuppressive phenotype and PMN formation in NSCLC.

    "title": "The Shifting and Evolving Neoadjuvant Treatments and Surgical Platforms on Oncological Outcomes and Sphincter Preservation in Distal Rectal Cancer: A 23-Year Retrospective Experience.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate how advancements in surgical technology and evolving neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) protocols have influenced clinical, pathological, and long-term oncological outcomes in patients with locally advanced distal rectal cancer (LADRC). Particular emphasis is placed on how the evolving practice of a single high-volume colorectal surgeon has mirrored these developments over a 23-year period. This retrospective cohort included 561 patients with LADRC who underwent NAT between 2001 and 2024. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the year 2013, which marked the institutional adoption of robotic surgery, high-resolution 3-Tesla MRI, and the formal implementation of the Watch-and-Wait (W&W) strategy: Group I (2001-2012) and Group II (2013-2024). The median follow-up duration was significantly longer in Group 1 (191 ± 2.29 months) compared to Group 2 (71 ± 2.81 months). Local recurrence (LR) occurred in 11.6% of patients in Group 1 and 6.9% in Group 2 (p = 0.107), while distant metastasis (DM) was observed in 15.5% and 10.6%, respectively (p = 0.178) (Fig. 2). Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years was 67.4% (95% CI: 58.6-74.8) in Group 1 and 80.1% (95% CI: 75.6-83.8) in Group 2 (p = 0.003). At 10 years, DFS was 65.2% (95% CI: 58.6-74.8) and 79.4% (95% CI: 74.7-83.3) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.006). Similarly, overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 78.0% (95% CI: 67.6-82.4) in Group 1 and 91.7% (95% CI: 87.9-93.3) in Group 2 (p < 0.001). At 10 years, OS was 73.4% (95% CI: 66.0-81.1) and 90.5% (95% CI: 87.3-92.9), respectively (p < 0.001). Additionally, permanent stoma-free survival (PSFS) improved significantly over time, from 56.5% in Group 1 to 85.8% in Group 2 (p < 0.001). The integration of robotic surgery, high-resolution MRI, and the W&W strategy has significantly improved oncological outcomes and sphincter preservation rates in patients with LADRC over the past two decades.",

    "title": "Capturing breast cancers' copy-number landscape in routine pathology: Exploiting low-resolution, genome-wide sequencing to identify HRD and beyond.",
    "abstract": "Because breast cancer (BC) is molecularly heterogeneous, diagnosis and treatment will likely benefit from comprehensive genetic profiling. However, routine, high-resolution sequencing is not feasible yet, due to implementation challenges associated with whole-genome sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) BC samples. Therefore, we explored the potential of an alternative low-resolution, genome-wide testing approach that is able to capture the copy number (CN) landscape, including actionable alterations, in FFPE derived DNA. The performance of the genome-wide CN testing approach, including CN signatures/focal CN alterations, was evaluated in two phases: (i) exploration and (ii) feasibility phase. First, high-resolution sequencing data of a previously published triple-negative BC cohort (n = 237) was leveraged to benchmark the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-related CN signature using a comprehensive, multimodal approach incorporating both genetic and functional HRD tests. Secondly, the low-resolution testing strategy's feasibility was prospectively evaluated in a BC cohort of patients referred to clinical genetic services (n = 147). Applying the HRD threshold that was established using both genomic and functional HRD data, we identified a 100% sensitivity for BC with BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 pathogenic variants in the prospective cohort. Moreover, the success rate of the low-resolution testing approach proved high, regardless of input material. Finally, additional CN alterations were enriched in the HR-proficient BC population, indicating potential actionable CN-alterations beyond HRD. In conclusion, low-resolution, genome-wide sequencing has shown high potential in capturing the CN landscape, including features associated with HRD, in BC patients. This preselection testing approach is likely to maximize potential for personalized medicine and genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer. However, accumulating evidence indicates that tumor cells exhibit insensitivity to classic ferroptosis inducers. In the present study, through high-throughput screening of a metabolite library, we identified cerulenin as a potent ferroptosis sensitizer. Mechanistically, cerulenin dually targets fatty acid synthase (FASN) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1), thereby inhibiting their enzymatic activity. FASN inhibition unexpectedly promoted ferroptosis via suppressing carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)-mediated lipid β-oxidation, thereby triggering polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) accumulation to drive ferroptosis. Simultaneously, HMGCS1 inhibition disrupted the mevalonate pathway, leading to impaired selenocysteine tRNA maturation and subsequent suppressing the synthesis of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein, which enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to ferroptosis inducers. Clinical bioinformatics analysis of TCGA datasets revealed significant co-overexpression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), FASN, and HMGCS1 in multiple malignancies, which correlated with poor patient survival rates. In vivo, cerulenin synergized with classic ferroptosis inducer erastin to suppress xenograft tumor growth without observable toxicity. Collectively, this study revealed that cerulenin dual-targets FASN/HMGCS1 and obtained with remarkable pro-ferroptosis properties, providing a mechanistically distinct therapeutic paradigm for precision cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, initially responds to platinum-based chemotherapy, but due to frequent defects in the DNA damage response (DDR), most tumors develop resistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying clinical platinum resistance remain poorly defined with no biomarkers or targeted therapies to improve outcomes. Here, applying mass cytometry, we quantify phosphorylation and abundance of DDR proteins in carboplatin-treated HGSC cell line models. Despite similar levels of intranuclear platinum, a proxy for carboplatin uptake, cells follow divergent fates, reflecting DDR heterogeneity. Unsupervised analysis reveals a continuum of DDR states, and matrix factorization identifies eight protein modules. The activity of one module, containing canonical DDR proteins, increases in carboplatin-sensitive cells. Resistant cells engage a broader DDR protein module. These findings demonstrate the ability of single-cell proteomics to identify functional DDR states and reveal a DDR sensitivity module as a promising biomarker for clinical stratification and therapeutic decisions in HGSC.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac ischemia, a predominant cause of heart failure, is marked by profound mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated ion homeostasis, and maladaptive cellular remodeling, all of which compromise cardiac performance. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein Leucine zipper-EF-hand containing Transmembrane Protein 1 (Letm1), implicated in Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome, is essential for mitochondrial function. Although genetic alterations in Letm1 are linked to cardiomyopathies, its specific contributions to cardiac pathophysiology, particularly in the context of ischemic heart disease, remain poorly defined. This study aims to elucidate the role of Letm1 in ischemic cardiac pathology and its mechanistic impact on cardiomyocyte function. Letm1 expression was assessed in human and murine models of heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and cardiac hypertrophy. Letm1 was overexpressed in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, adult mouse cardiomyocytes, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to study mitochondrial function (Seahorse assays), structural and molecular remodeling (fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), qPCR, immunoblotting), transcriptomic/proteomic profiles, calcium handling and electrophysiology (patch-clamp), autophagic flux (Bafilomycin A1, LC3-RFP-GFP), and cell survival. Letm1 was markedly upregulated in ICM in both human and murine hearts, but unchanged in hypertrophic heart failure. Overexpression of Letm1 in cardiomyocytes resulted in profound mitochondrial dysfunction, including downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, impaired membrane potential, reduced ATP output, increased proton leak, and elevated ROS levels. A metabolic shift toward glycolysis was observed, accompanied by reduced fatty acid oxidation. Electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial fragmentation, mitophagic vesicles, and sarcomeric disarray. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses highlighted dysregulation of genes linked to mitochondrial organization, ion transport, and autophagy. Electrophysiologically, Letm1 reduced L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current density and significantly shortened action potential duration, leading to impaired contractility. Letm1 overexpression activated upstream autophagy regulators (AMPK, ULK1) and enhanced LC3-II and p62 accumulation, but autophagic flux was impaired, as confirmed by LC3-RFP-GFP reporter and exacerbated by Bafilomycin A1 treatment. This dysregulated autophagy was coupled with mitochondrial stress, increased apoptosis (cleaved caspases), and reduced cardiomyocyte viability. This study indicates that Letm1 upregulation drives mitochondrial dysfunction, electrophysiology alterations, and activation of autophagy and apoptosis, culminating in cardiomyocyte injury in ischemic cardiomyopathy. By disrupting OXPHOS, calcium handling, and cell survival pathways, Letm1 contributes to ischemic remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Targeting Letm1 presents a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate ischemic damage and preserve cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Non-melanoma skin cancer is a prevalent complication in renal transplant recipients due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine, are effective in preventing graft rejection; however, they significantly increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer through broad immunosuppressive and pro-oncogenic mechanisms. Belatacept, a selective co-stimulation blocker targeting the CD80/CD86-CD28 axis, has emerged as a mechanistically distinct alternative with potential benefits for oncologic and renal outcomes. The primary objective of this review is to examine the impact of belatacept-based immunosuppression on the incidence and progression of non-melanoma skin cancer in renal transplant recipients, compared to conventional Calcineurin inhibitors. Secondary objectives include evaluating the immunologic mechanisms underlying its distinct cancer risk profile, exploring combinatory regimens (particularly with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors), assessing metabolic and nephrotoxic implications, and addressing ethical and clinical considerations in switching stable patients from Calcineurin inhibitors to belatacept. Although retrospective studies suggest a lower incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer with belatacept, robust prospective data remain limited, and its use is associated with increased early rejection and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder risk, particularly in Epstein-Barr virus seronegative patients. Emerging molecular biomarkers and transcriptomic insights may facilitate the development of personalized immunosuppression strategies. Further randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies are essential to clarify belatacept's oncologic safety and optimize immunosuppressive protocols in high-risk transplant populations.",

Therefore, we categorized the microbiota into feces and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) groups to compare microbial characteristics between benign and malignant masses, analyze their clinical correlations, and develop predictive models for lung cancer. A total of 238 fecal samples and 34 BALF samples were collected from patients with benign and malignant masses and then analyzed by 16 SrRNA. We explored the distinct composition of the gut and lung microbiota and their associations with clinical features. The diagnostic models were constructed using microbial features identified through two approaches: random forest algorithm with five-fold cross-validation and comparative analysis of significantly differential taxa. The performance evaluation was subsequently conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. There was no significant difference in α-and β-diversity between feces and BALF groups. The relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (P = 0.003232) and Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003 (P = 0.01316) in feces group and Proteobacteria (P = 0.03654) in BALF group were significantly increased in lung cancer patients. We also found Bacteroides (P = 0.01458) was abundant in NSCLC than those of SCLC in feces group, while the BALF group was dominated by norank_c_Cyanobacteria (P = 0.03384). Smoking history appeared to be related to the distribution of microbiota, with enrichment of Parabacteroides (P = 0.02054) in feces and Prevotella_1 (P = 0.03286) in BALF. Furthermore, the patients with Sellimonas (P = 0.04148) in feces and Alloprevotella (P = 0.04283) in BALF seemed to have better response to chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. For differentiating benign and malignant masses, the combination of Megasphaera and norank_p__Saccharibacteria in BALF demonstrated superior predictive performance, with an AUC reaching 0.8 (95% CI 0.59-1). The microbiota composition significantly differed between benign and malignant masses in both fecal and BALF groups, with minimal evidence supporting microbial migration between these two sites. Our findings suggest that BALF microbiota may serve as a more reliable biomarker for lung masses classification, offering valuable insights for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health concern, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. This study investigates the role of Reticulocalbin-3 (RCN3) in CRC development, focusing on its regulatory influence on calcium ion homeostasis and transport proteins, critical factors in cancer progression. We employed bioinformatics databases, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate RCN3 expression levels, revealing that RCN3 is upregulated in CRC tissues and correlates with poorer patient outcomes. Functional assays demonstrated that alterations in RCN3 expression significantly accelerated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the interaction of RCN3's EF-hand domains 3 and 4 with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) promotes its translocation to the cellular membrane, inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress through elevated intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, RCN3 was found to regulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-S6 signaling pathway by enhancing the phosphorylation of key proteins, thereby emphasizing its multifaceted role in CRC pathogenesis. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RCN3 not only contributes to CRC progression but also holds promise as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for improving patient outcomes in CRC management.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, especially in East Asia, with a low 5-year survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Identifying molecular mechanisms that regulate GC progression is critical for improving clinical outcomes. RNF81, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, has demonstrated diverse roles in various cancers. In this study, we uncover its tumor-suppressive function in GC through novel regulatory pathways. Analysis of clinical data and tissue microarrays revealed that RNF81 expression is significantly downregulated in GC tissues and positively correlates with patient survival. Mechanistically, we identified lysine demethylase KDM1A as a key repressor of RNF81 expression. KDM1A recruits transcription factor E2F1 to form a transcriptional repressor complex, reducing H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 levels at the RNF81 promoter. Functional studies showed that RNF81 stabilizes the tumor suppressor KLF4 by binding through its SPRY domain, thereby inhibiting KLF4 ubiquitination and degradation. Overexpression of RNF81 suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo, effects that were partially rescued by KLF4 knockdown. These findings reveal a novel KDM1A-RNF81-KLF4 regulatory axis in GC and highlight RNF81 as a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment. Targeting this pathway may offer promising strategies to improve outcomes for GC patients.",

Here, we identified a novel scaffold protein HOMER3 in PCa, that can promote YAP1 activity by disrupting LATS-YAP1 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, HOMER3 overexpression in PCa facilitates the SRC kinase to phosphorylate YAP1 accompanied by counteracting LATS1-mediated YAP1 inhibition, thereby maintaining high YAP1 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Accordingly, HOMER3 gain-of-function in PCa cells phenocopies the effect of YAP1 activation, including cell hyperproliferation in vitro and rapid tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, transcriptome analysis revealed that CD274 is consistently upregulated in HOMER3 overexpressing PCa cells and patients, which eventually contributed to an immunosuppressive phenotype. More importantly, blocking SRC kinase-mediated YAP1 activation improved the immunotherapy-insensitive phenotypes in PCa caused by HOMER3 overexpression. Taken together, our findings define a novel kinase-substrate interactive platform for HOMER3 to orchestrate YAP1 activity in PCa. Targeting SRC-YAP1 oncogenic axis provides new insights into the therapeutic potential for PCa patients carried HOMER3 overexpression.",

Psychological assessments revealed reduced anxiety and depression, with lower SAS and SDS scores (P < 0.05). The observation group also had higher EORTC QLQ-C30 scores, indicating better quality of life (P < 0.05). Psychological intervention combined with enhanced nutritional support significantly improves postoperative recovery in CRC patients by enhancing nutritional status, sleep quality, pain management, and psychological well-being. This integrated approach may serve as an effective strategy for CRC rehabilitation. Integrating psychological support with enhanced nutritional care significantly improves recovery, quality of life, and emotional wellbeing after colorectal cancer surgery. For survivors, this highlights the importance of comprehensive supportive interventions that address both physical and psychological needs in routine survivorship care.",

    "abstract": "Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in multiple cancers. Multiple types of KRAS mutation are observed in various patients with cancer, and the KRAS(G12D) mutation is the most common. Although multiple covalent inhibitors of the KRAS(G12C) mutation have been identified and clinically validated to date, no drugs have been approved yet for other mutations, including G12D. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of ASP3082, a KRAS(G12D)-selective degrader, and the crystal structure of the drug-induced ternary complex of KRAS(G12D)/ASP3082/VHL (von Hippel-Lindau). We have also demonstrated an efficient structure-based rational optimization approach, which could be applicable for the optimization of other bifunctional proximity-inducing drugs. ASP3082 effectively induces KRAS(G12D) protein degradation with remarkable selectivity, demonstrates highly efficacious and durable pharmacological activity, and induces tumor regression in multiple KRAS(G12D)-mutated cancer xenograft models. Our results suggest that ASP3082 is a potential therapeutic agent for KRAS(G12D)-mutated cancer, and is now under clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that modulate T cell immunity by secreting humoral factors and forming structural barriers. CAFs secrete the chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which binds to C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on T cells and induces chemotaxis. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), another humoral factor secreted by CAFs, has been reported to regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis; however, a direct association between them has not been demonstrated in human medicine or veterinary medicine. This study investigated the role of canine CAFs in T cell migration through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and the regulatory influence of TGF-β1. CXCL12 and CXCR4 were expressed in the tumor stroma and on T cells, respectively, in dogs with epithelial malignant tumors. Canine CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and TGF-β1 than normal fibroblasts, and CAF-derived TGF-β1 modulated both CXCL12 secretion by CAFs and CXCR4 expression on T cells. Furthermore, canine CAFs induced T cell migration through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. These findings indicate that CAFs may influence T cell migration through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis under the regulation of TGF-β1 signaling, highlighting their potential role in shaping T cell dynamics within the TME.",

    "abstract": "Early and accurate brain tumor classification is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in medical image analysis, they often struggle to focus on critical information adequately and have limited feature extraction capabilities. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Residual Network based on Multi-dimensional Attention and Pinwheel Convolution (Res-MAPNet) for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based brain tumor classification. Res-MAPNet is developed on two key modules: the Coordinated Local Importance Enhancement Attention (CLIA) module and the Pinwheel-Shaped Attention Convolution (PSAConv) module. CLIA combines channel attention, spatial attention, and direction-aware positional encoding to focus on lesion areas. PSAConv enhances spatial feature perception through asymmetric padding and grouped convolution, expanding the receptive field for better feature extraction. The proposed model classifies two publicly brain tumor datasets into glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99.51% accuracy in the three-classification task and 98.01% accuracy in the four-classification task, better than the existing mainstream models. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of CLIA and PSAConv, which are 4.41% and 4.45% higher than the ConvNeXt baseline, respectively. This study provides an efficient and robust solution for brain tumor computer-aided diagnosis systems with potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The androgen receptor signaling inhibitor enzalutamide (Enz) is one the primary therapeutic drugs for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Nevertheless, most of patients ultimately develop resistance to Enz. Through an integrated analysis of CRISPR genome-wide and kinome-wide screens, coupled with observations of elevated expression levels in Enz-resistant cell lines and PCa tumor tissues, our study identified RPS6KC1 as a novel essential gene implicated in Enz resistance. Mechanistically, our research indicates that the Warburg effect induces H3K18 lactylation, which regulates the expression of RPS6KC1 via the transcription factor P65. Elevated expression of RPS6KC1 was found to recruit PRDX3 to the mitochondria, thereby mitigating ferroptosis. These findings suggest that the H3K18la/NF-κB/RPS6KC1/PRDX3 axis is important for the development of resistance to Enz. Our results suggest that the combination of Enz with targeted RPS6KC1 inhibition or a ferroptosis inducer may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome Enz resistance.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial part of the innate immune system and serve as an important effector for killing tumor cells through direct cytolytic activity or immunomodulatory signaling to T cells and antigen presenting cells. NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "As a central regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, STAT1 generates functionally distinct α and β protein isoforms through alternative splicing. We systematically investigated the expression patterns and prognostic relevance of STAT1 isoform-specific transcripts across pan-cancer tissues, with a particular focus on ovarian cancer (OV), and elucidated their potential mechanisms in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to influence patient prognosis. Integrated analysis of the GTEx and TCGA databases was conducted to systematically evaluate the transcript expression profiles of STAT1 isoforms across 32 cancer types and 29 normal tissues. Clinical prognostic significance was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, complemented by multi-omics approaches including functional enrichment analysis, Tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) immune signature evaluation, and mediation effect models. At the experimental validation level, protein expression differences were assessed by Western blotting, while dynamic changes in immune cell infiltration were examined via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multiplex immunofluorescence. In the GTEx/TCGA combined dataset, the transcriptional level of the STAT1α isoform was significantly higher than that of the β isoform in most tissues. However, Western blot revealed elevated expression of the STAT1β isoform in OV tissues and cell lines-a phenomenon that may reflect isoform-specific variations in mRNA translation efficiency and/or protein stability. IHC and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that STAT1 expression promoted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration, suppressed M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), and remodeled the immune microenvironment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the β isoform as an independent protective prognostic factor in OV (HR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.55-0.99, p < 0.05), and correlation analysis with TIDE immune scores showed higher absolute correlation coefficients for STAT1β. Mediation analysis indicated that STAT1β improved prognosis by reducing T-cell dysfunction (mediation: 26.53%) and inhibiting M2-TAMs infiltration (mediation: 48.07%). These effects may stem from underlying molecular mechanisms involving modulation of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling and transcriptional interference with CSF1-dependent differentiation signals. The STAT1β isoform plays a more critical role in OV progression and immunomodulation, with its prognostic protective effect closely linked to the regulation of the immune microenvironment. These findings underscore the functional heterogeneity of STAT1 isoforms and their distinct roles in tumor immunology. Future research should prioritize the development of subtype-specific diagnostic tools and targeted therapeutic strategies to advance the development of precision immunotherapies.",

Although various fertility preservation techniques are currently accessible, there remains a pressing demand for an efficient, non-invasive strategy to protect ovarian function that can be employed concurrently with chemotherapy. Considering the significance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in regulating DNA damage and apoptosis, we aimed to examine the protective effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor) on ovarian function against CTX-induced damage. Eight-week-old female C57 mice were underwent to a 14-day treatment protocol, receiving either saline, CTX, or CTX combined with NMN supplementation. The protective effects of NMN supplementation during CTX treatment on ovarian reserve, oocyte quality, and developmental competence were evaluated. NMN supplementation during CTX treatment increased NAD<sup>+</sup> content in the ovary, improved ovarian reserve, enhanced endocrine function, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, alleviated DNA damage, and reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, this supplementation improved the rates of two-cell embryo and blastocyst formation, increased total cell counts, while decreasing ROS levels, DNA damage, and apoptosis in blastocysts. Moreover, the protective mechanisms of NMN may involve key genes such as Banp and Rbm47 in the ovarian tissue, along with serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1) in oocytes. Collectively, our results highlight the protective effects of NMN against CTX-induced damage to the reproductive function, thus addressing a critical gap in fertility preservation.

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modification are two hallmarks of cancer. Protein lysine lactylation (Kla) is a novel type of glycolysis lactate-triggered posttranslational modification. However, the role of Kla in breast cancer (BC) remains largely unknown. Here, western blot, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of BC tissues revealed that global Kla levels were upregulated in BC tissues, and high levels of Kla were correlated with poor prognosis of patients with BC. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that interruption of glycolysis by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor or silencing LDHA and LDHB repressed the malignant behaviors of BC cells. Moreover, 4D label-free quantitative lactylproteomics analysis of BC tissues and cells revealed that lactylated proteins widely existed in several subcellular compartments and were closely associated with various cancer-related biological processes. Notably, two previously unresearched sites of histone lactylation, H4K79 lactylation (H4K79la) and H4K91 lactylation (H4K91la), were identified to be hyperlactylated in cancer tissues and cells. Glycolytic genes, such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and hexokinase 1 (HK1) were identified to be the potential candidate genes epigenetically regulated by H4K79la and H4K91la by intersecting through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and TCGA-BRCA database. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis downregulated H4K79 and H4K91 lactylation and suppressed the expression of glycolytic genes, whereas treatment with sodium lactate exhibited the opposite effects. Additionally, E1A-binding protein p300 (P300) acted as lysine lactyltransferase to regulate H4K79la and H4K91la, and control the transcription and expression of downstream glycolytic genes in BC cells. The results revealed an intriguing positive feedback loop formed by glycolysis/H4K79la/H4K91la/glycolytic genes in BC, highlighting the relationship between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic regulation. These findings provide new therapeutic targets for patients with BC.",

    "abstract": "By integrating photothermal and chemodynamic properties, Ru-based nanomaterials have emerged as promising agents for tumor therapy. However, their clinical translation is hindered by high systemic toxicity, suboptimal therapeutic efficacy, and compromised chemodynamic performance caused by tumor antioxidant defense mechanisms. A multifunctional therapeutic platform (Ru-PC-PEITC-ALG) was developed through the coordination-driven self-assembly of ruthenium ions with procyanidins (PCs) to form Ru-PC nanoparticles, followed by coencapsulation with phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) in a sodium alginate hydrogel. The Ru-PC complex demonstrated exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency, enabling rapid intratumoral temperature elevation under 808 nm laser irradiation to achieve localized thermal ablation. Simultaneously, Ru-PC exhibited tumor microenvironment-responsive catalytic activity, catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (·OH) via Fenton-like reactions. This ROS generation was substantially amplified through synergistic photothermal acceleration of reaction kinetics and PEITC-mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion, which effectively disabled the antioxidant defense system. Systematic evaluations, including in vitro cytotoxicity assays, transcriptomic sequencing, and murine xenograft models, confirmed the platform's superior tumor suppression ability and favorable biosafety profile. Mechanistic studies revealed that combination therapy induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated the apoptosis/ferroptosis pathways.

Informants were recruited from an outpatient clinic for investigation of macroscopic hematuria, with interview questions derived from literature and clinical experience. Researchers immersed themselves in the data through repeated readings of transcripts, identifying meaning units that were coded and analyzed to develop subcategories reflecting similarities and differences. Twelve patients, with a median age of 71 years (58% women), participated in the study. Among them, one was diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (UBC). The findings highlight a mix of appreciation and questioning associated with the SCP process, as patients valued the efficiency of one stop policy for testing but also experienced heightened anxiety. A lack of detailed and patient-centred communication emerged as a key issue, with primary care centers providing insufficient information. Although SCP is effective, it prompts consideration of whether it is suitable for all patients.

Presently, second-generation CAR-T therapy has reached clinical implementation, while fifth-generation CAR-T therapy is in active development.

Nevertheless, emerging strategies, including combination therapies and gene editing technologies, exhibit promising potential in enhancing CAR-T cell effectiveness. In this review, we comprehensively examine the current state of research on CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors, with a particular focus on the various antigenic targets that have been explored for solid tumors. We critically review established and novel targets, providing insights into their therapeutic potential and limitations. Additionally, we highlight the key challenges that currently hinder the success of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors, including the choice of target antigens, physical barriers, antigen escape, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and adverse reactions.

Tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy (TSP) are widely performed in Japan. However, their correlation with renal outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between renal prognosis and steroid pulse therapy with or without tonsillectomy. In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients diagnosed with IgAN between April 2002 and March 2021 using a Japanese healthcare records database. We selected patients with a prescription history of methylprednisolone for three consecutive days within one year of diagnosis and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or above. We categorized the patients into TSP and steroid pulse therapy (SP) groups based on whether they underwent tonsillectomy within one year of diagnosis. The primary outcome was the composite outcome of a 30% decline in eGFR and initiation of dialysis, and the secondary outcomes comprised the composite outcome of end-stage renal failure and initiation of dialysis and eGFR slope. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity score, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and weighted Cox regression analysis by applying IPTW were performed. Overall, 550 patients were eligible for the main analysis, and approximately 40% underwent tonsillectomy within 1 year of IgAN diagnosis: 221 in the TSP group and 329 in the SP group. The primary outcome did not differ between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.58; [95% confidence interval: 0.22-1.54]; P = 0.28). The groups did not differ in terms of the secondary outcomes. Although we could not demonstrate the effectiveness of TSP on renal prognosis in patients with IgAN, this study may have been underpowered, and there are certain limitations due to the information available from the database, we were able to evaluate the association of TSP on renal outcomes using real-world data.

    "abstract": "Timely entry into mitosis requires activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) by Aurora kinase A (Aurora A), but the upstream signaling trigger remains unclear. Here, we show that cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling serves as a critical initiator of mitosis in mammalian cells. Specifically, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates Bora, enabling it to bind Aurora A and recruit it to the Bora-Plk1 complex during G2 phase, thereby facilitating Aurora A-dependent activation of Plk1. Disruption of PKA-mediated Bora phosphorylation or the Bora-Aurora A interaction impairs Plk1 activation and delays the G2-to-mitosis (G2/M) transition. Conversely, a phospho-mimetic Bora mutant bypasses the requirement for PKA in promoting Bora-Aurora A interaction, Plk1 activation, and mitotic entry. Furthermore, PKA-mediated Bora phosphorylation and the resulting Bora-Aurora A interaction are essential for mitotic entry during DNA damage checkpoint recovery. Together, these findings identify the cAMP-PKA-Bora-Aurora A-Plk1 signaling cascade as a previously unrecognized and critical trigger for mitotic commitment.",

Combination therapy with PD-1 blockade further promotes long-term immunological memory formation by activation of dendritic cells and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the translational potential of DARPin-DC and its promising prospects for clinical combination with immunotherapies in the treatment of solid tumors, including refractory pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). CAF phenotypes are highly heterogeneous and exert anti- and protumorigenic effects. We present a mathematical model that describes cancer-immune-CAF interactions and exploits the heterogeneity of CAF phenotypes to predict cancer progression and treatment response. By simulating multiple treatment options, including targeted monotherapies alone, two different immunotherapies, and a combination of therapies, we have found that CAF composition can impact treatment outcomes, potentially resulting in comparable effectiveness of single-drug treatments and combinatorial approaches or even the ineffectiveness of multicombination therapies. These findings suggest that CAF composition can be a promising indicator, in some cases guiding the choice towards less invasive therapies without compromising effectiveness. Our model indicates that accounting for CAF characteristics might facilitate the matching of targeted treatments, supporting clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare, aggressive mesenchymal neoplasms with high recurrence and metastasis rates. Here, we perform a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of 189 cases of CNS SFTs integrating 94 whole genome sequencing, 88 transcriptomics, 7 single-nucleus RNA sequencing and 3 spatial transcriptome sequencing. We find that receptor tyrosine kinase mutations are significantly more prevalent besides the widespread NAB2-STAT6 fusion and correlate with tumor grade. Transcriptomic analysis reveals four molecular subtypes-classical, neural-like, inflamed and migratory-each associated with distinct clinical and biological characteristics. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identifies five tumor cell states, with the SFT_classical state serving as a precursor to other states influenced by hypoxia and inflammation. Notably, we identify FER kinase as a key therapeutic target, with FER inhibition significantly reducing tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These findings provide important insights into CNS SFT biology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for this challenging tumor type.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT)-elicited antitumor immunity serves as a pivotal mechanism in RT-mediated tumor control. The strategic integration of RT with immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), is revolutionizing cancer therapeutics, demonstrating remarkable clinical potential. In this context, identifying molecular targets to potentiate radioimmunotherapy (RIT) efficacy represents a critical research priority. Emerging as a central immunomodulatory axis, the cGAS/STING signaling pathway bridges DNA damage response with antitumor immunity, positioning itself as a prime therapeutic target for radiation sensitization. Our study unveils caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as a previously unrecognized suppressor of cGAS/STING signaling that governs radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer (CRC). CAD physically blocks STING dimerization and cGAMP binding through a nuclease-independent function, thereby compromising RT-induced STING activation and subsequent type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Functional analyses demonstrated that CAD ablation potentiates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration/activation within the tumor microenvironment and synergizes with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy upon radiation. Translational validation revealed clinical correlations between CAD overexpression in CRC specimens and suboptimal radiotherapy responses coupled with diminished intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Collectively, our findings establish CAD as a novel rheostat of cGAS-STING signaling and propose CAD inhibition as a promising combinatorial strategy to enhance RT and RIT efficacy in CRC.",

Research in this field is largely underdeveloped due to the lack of tools that enable the systematic identification of AMPylated substrates. Here, we address this gap by developing an enrichment technique to isolate and study AMPylated proteins using a nucleotide-binding protein, hinT. Cryo-EM reconstruction of an AMPylated protein bound to hinT provides a structural basis for AMP selectivity. Using structure guided mutagenesis, we optimize enrichment to identify novel substrates of the evolutionarily conserved AMPylase, Selenoprotein O. We show that mammalian Selenoprotein O regulates metabolic flux through AMPylation of key mitochondrial proteins including glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Our findings highlight the broader significance of AMPylation, an emerging post translational modification with critical roles in signal transduction and disease pathology. Furthermore, we establish a powerful enrichment platform for the discovery of novel AMPylated proteins to study the mechanisms and significance of protein AMPylation in cellular function.",

    "abstract": "IDH-mutant gliomas represent a subtype of diffuse gliomas that primarily affect patients in early to mid-adolescence. These tumors are classified into three distinct CNS WHO grades of malignancy. Accurate grading is essential for selecting an appropriate treatment maximizing anti-tumor efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. However, grading of oligodendrogliomas with 1p/19q codeletion currently relies on qualitative tumor characteristics that may be influenced by observer subjectivity, sampling bias, and tumor heterogeneity. This study aimed to explore DNA methylation-based tumor deconvolution into latent methylation components (LMCs) to evaluate their potential as objective grading tools in a cohort of 137 IDH-mutant gliomas. LMCs were analyzed in relation to malignancy markers, cellular composition, and underlying methylation signatures of the chromatin landscape. Glioma subtypes were associated with distinct LMCs. Two LMCs correlated with higher cellular density and advanced epigenetic age as well as with microvascular proliferation, necrosis, and epigenetically defined high-grade astrocytoma. The epigenetic patterns defining high-grade astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, respectively, were similar. Higher-grade oligodendrogliomas, identified by LMC-based grading, were associated with more copy number alterations. Among patients of an external cohort who died during the assessment period, higher LMC1 proportions were associated with poorer overall survival. Therefore, LMCs hold the potential to support IDH-mutant glioma grading by incorporating objective epigenetic markers.",

We sought to examine the outcomes of NCT versus NCRT in esophageal cancer. Utilizing the National Cancer Database, we identified esophagectomy patients with EAC who underwent multi-agent NCT versus multi-agent NCRT. Groups were statistically equated with propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. After PSM, we identified 1007 patients in each group. There was improved lymphadenectomy and higher use of adjuvant therapy in the NCT group, and significant improvements in R0 resection and pathologic response associated with NCRT. There was also a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in the NCT versus NCRT groups. The median and 5-year OS were 42.7 months and 42% in NCT versus 34.2 months and 35% in NCRT (p = 0.001). For pathologic complete responders, median and 5-year OS were 101 months and 64% in NCT versus 71.2 months and 53% in NCRT (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, reduced mortality was associated with female sex, pathologic N0, >10 nodes removed, pathologic partial or complete response, R0, well/moderate grade, NCT, adjuvant chemotherapy, and higher facility volume. Despite the higher R0 rate and pathologic response associated with NCRT, NCT was associated with improved OS compared with NCRT in EAC patients. While NCT shows an OS advantage in this dataset, regimen heterogeneity precludes definitive therapeutic recommendations.",

There remains apprehension to omit ALND for patients in whom only 1-2 SLNs are retrieved and all are positive. This study evaluates current practices and pathological findings when ALND is pursued. We identified female patients with cT1-3N0 breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy from 2018 to 2021 in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Patients with ≤ 2 SLNs were included and categorized on the basis of the number positive/removed: 0/1, 1/1, 1/2, and 2/2. We assessed the rates and factors associated with ALND. A total of 102,802 patients were included: 0/1: 79,106 (77%), 1/1: 10,549 (10%), 1/2: 10,068 (10%), and 2/2: 3079 (3%). ALND was most frequently performed for patients with 2/2 +SLNs (41%), followed by 26% with 1/1 +SLNs, 19% with 1/2 +SLNs, and 6% with 0/1 +SLNs. On multivariable analysis, 2/2 +SLN status was the strongest independent predictor of ALND. For triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2+ patients, ALND did not affect adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation rates. Among pN+ hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- patients > 50, ALND was linked to higher chemotherapy rates in all SLN groups, despite no difference in 21-gene recurrence scores. With a median follow-up of 35.4 months, ALND did not improve overall survival. ALND is being performed at higher-than-expected rates in patients with ≤ 2 +SLNs and may contribute to adjuvant overtreatment, particularly in HR+/HER2- patients. Multidisciplinary case discussions and ongoing provider education are essential to reduce unnecessary axillary interventions.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Breast Surgical Oncology (BSO) fellowship programs transitioned to virtual interviews; however, for the 2024 cycle, programs selected either virtual or in-person interviews with applicants participating in potentially both formats. Following the match, a survey was performed to evaluate experiences among applicants and program directors (PDs). Surveys were developed within the BSO Fellowship Program Directors Committee and distributed via email to matched applicants and PDs from 18 July 2024 to 9 August 2024. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Of the 89 matched applicants, 60 completed the survey (response rate 67.4%). Most applicants (76.7%, n = 46) preferred in-person over virtual interviews. The top reason for preferring in-person was 'to see the program in person' (56.7%, n = 34). Nearly half of applicants (48.3%, n = 29) estimated spending ≥$5000 on interviews, and 78.3% (n = 47) indicated the cost was 'worth it'. Over half of applicants (51.7%, n = 31) reported interview style had an impact on their match. Of the 64 PDs, 38 completed the survey (response rate 59.4%). Virtual interviews were the most common format (65.8%, n = 25). The most important factor reported by most programs regarding the interview approach was cost to applicants (42.1%, n = 16). Over half of PDs (52.6%, n = 20) felt the interview approach influenced the match. The majority of 2024 BSO fellowship matched applicants preferred in-person interviews, noting the importance of location, faculty, and culture to their decision making. This data may assist PDs in choosing the interview approach best suited for their programs and guide training programs more broadly.",

This study investigates the impact of TTS on oncologic outcomes using the I-SPY 2 Trial cohort. A retrospective analysis of 1877 patients with breast cancer enrolled in the I-SPY 2 Trial was performed. Patients were grouped by TTS post-NAC: 1-4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, and 9 + weeks. Baseline demographic, clinical, imaging, and treatment response data were collected. Event-free survival (EFS) and local recurrence-free interval (LRFI) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox models. Subgroup analyses were performed by tumor receptor subtypes (hormone receptor [HR]+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-, HER2 +, and triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]) and residual cancer burden (RCB) class. Among 1877 patients, 526 (28.0%) underwent surgery between 1-4 weeks, 425 (22.6%) at 5 weeks, 490 (26.1%) between 6-8 weeks, and 436 (23.2%) at 9+ weeks post-NAC. Prolonged TTS was associated with worse 5-year EFS and LRFI on Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.001 for both). Delays particularly affected outcomes in patients with HR+/HER2- and TNBC tumors. In patients with RCB class II/III, a TTS of 9+ weeks was independently associated with worse EFS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.04, p = 0.001) and LRFI (HR 2.77, p = 0.005). Conversely, in patients with a pathologic complete response/RCB class I, delayed surgery did not significantly impact outcomes.

However, the ideal number of LNs required for precise staging and improved survival remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the optimal number of lymph nodes (LNs) to retrieve during pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer to minimize false node-negative (false N0) rates and assess its impact on survival outcomes. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from patients undergoing curative-intent upfront surgery for pancreatic cancer at two tertiary centers in South Korea (2010-2021). An exploration cohort of 808 patients was used to identify LN retrieval thresholds, and the results were validated in an independent cohort of 444 patients. The study excluded patients who received neoadjuvant therapy or had fewer than two retrieved LNs. False N0 rates and 5 year overall survival were analyzed. In the exploration cohort, examining 16 LNs reduced the false N0 rate to 18.9%, whereas in the validation cohort, retrieving 12 LNs resulted in a false N0 rate of 19.5%. Among the node-negative (N0) patients, retrieving up to 21 LNs was associated with improved 5 year overall survival. Differences in cutoff values between cohorts were attributed to demographic variations and inclusion of fewer LNs retrieved but higher detection of metastatic nodes in the validation cohort. Retrieving a sufficient number of LNs during pancreatectomy is essential to reducing false N0 rates and improving survival outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients. These findings highlight the need for standardized LN evaluation protocols and support further prospective, multi-center studies to optimize staging accuracy.",

Patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who underwent surgical resection following NACRT or NAC between December 2011 and March 2017 were included in this study. Clinicopathological factors were compared using propensity score-matched analyses. A total of 347 patients were included; 170 underwent NACRT, and 177 underwent NAC. In the propensity score-matched cohort, the posttreatment CA19-9 level was significantly lower in the NACRT group. Pathological lymph node metastasis was significantly less and pathological tumor response was better in the NACRT group. Median overall survival was comparable (56.3 months in NACRT group and 50.5 months in NAC group). Disease-free survival did not differ significantly, but local recurrence was significantly less in the NACRT group. In the whole cohort, multivariate analysis showed that portal vein resection, transfusion, residual cancer, and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were independent factors associated with poor overall survival. Logistic regression analysis showed that NAC, combined portal vein resection, and margin-positive resection were risk factors for local recurrence. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy showed a stronger local control effect than NAC for resectable pancreatic cancer, but overall survival and disease-free survival were not significantly different between treatment groups. The present study suggests that more effective systemic treatment, as well as local control, is crucial even in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.",

A 70-year-old man with cStage III cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma received definitive chemoradiotherapy. One month later, lung and bone metastases were detected. Chemotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin was continued, followed by palliative radiotherapy. Although the primary tumor disappeared, the lung metastases progressed, and nivolumab was administered. After a single dose, the patient developed multiple irAEs, including interstitial pneumonia, hypophysitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. These were managed with corticosteroids. Subsequently, the pulmonary metastases regressed and eventually disappeared. Radiotherapy was also performed for later local recurrences. No further systemic therapy was given, and the patient has remained alive in the 45 months.

    "title": "AI-enhanced rapid diagnostic testing platform for mass opisthorchiasis screening.",
    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a prevalent malignancy in countries along Mekong basin, closely linked to chronic infections caused by Opisthorchis viverrini (OV). Early detection of OV-infected individuals holds significant promise for screening at-risk populations in endemic regions. Recent advancements in immunochromatographic methods have led to the development of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on urinary antigens. However, the current interpretation relies on visual assessment of T-band color intensity, which can be subjective and prone to variability. Furthermore, aggregating data at the regional/country level demands data digitization, a time and resource intense task that introduces further errors. To address this limitation, we introduce the OV-RDT platform, a cloud-based system incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) designed to standardize the reading and interpretation of OV-RDT results while facilitating mass screening campaigns for opisthorchiasis. This cross-platform solution, available on Android and iOS devices, consists of three key components: a mobile application, an intelligent dashboard, and a cloud server cluster. The server cluster has two main components the data processing server and the AI server. The AI server operates two AI-based models systematically developed and validated for image quality assessment and T-band grading of OV-RDT test kit images. The data processing server periodically retrieves and processes data from the cloud database, enabling comprehensive daily visualization through the intelligent dashboard. Validation through extensive field testing was conducted specifically in the northeastern region of Thailand, where opisthorchiasis prevalence is among the highest globally, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness by processing over 100,000 samples. While our platform shows excellent performance in this endemic region, external validation in other geographical areas would be necessary to establish broader generalizability. The EfficientNet-B5-based deep learning model used in the platform exhibited impressive performance in both image quality assessment (98% accuracy) and infection grading classification (95% accuracy in detecting OV infection status). The platform's user-friendly interface has achieved high satisfaction rates (4.41/5.00) among healthcare workers, while its intelligent dashboard offers real-time analytics and geospatial visualization capabilities. This integrated approach marks a significant advancement in mass screening for opisthorchiasis, potentially enhancing early detection rates and supporting more effective public health interventions in Southeast Asia and the Mekong Basin countries. This study addresses the critical need for mass screening in northeastern Thailand, where liver fluke infection rates are particularly severe; however, the platform's performance in other regions requires future validation studies.",

    "title": "Refining treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer lacking actionable mutations: insights from multi-omics studies.",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies characterised by diverse histological and molecular features. Some NSCLCs, particularly adenocarcinomas, harbour genomic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases or downstream RAS/RAF signalling pathways, which are targets of effective therapies. NSCLCs lacking actionable genomic alterations often benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors, though only a minority of patients achieve long-term survival. These tumours often carry alterations in tumour suppressor genes like TP53, KEAP1, STK11, or NF1, for which pharmacological strategies are still under investigation. This review explores emerging therapeutic opportunities unveiled by multi-omics studies in NSCLCs without actionable genomic alterations. Proteogenomic approaches-integrating genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data-enable a comprehensive understanding of NSCLC molecular landscapes and signalling network dysregulation, helping to identify distinct tumour subtypes and potential therapeutic targets. These tumours exhibit alterations in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, immune signalling, epigenetic modulation and metabolic and redox pathways. Although therapies targeting tumour suppressor genes like p53 remain highly anticipated, extending our understanding of the broader molecular landscape in these tumours may reveal novel vulnerabilities and inform the development of novel drugs or combination strategies. This could further advance precision oncology for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "K-homology-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA decay and translational repression through recognition of adenine-uracil-rich elements. Although KSRP regulates approximately 16% of transcript expression, its role in cancer remains poorly defined. KSRP expression was analysed using qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Its functional role in follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) was examined through in vitro and in vivo assays. Luciferase reporter and rescue experiments were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. KSRP was significantly upregulated in FTC tissues and metastatic cell lines. Functional studies demonstrated that KSRP enhances the invasiveness and stemness of FTC cells. Mechanistically, KSRP promotes nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of β-catenin by downregulating the Wnt inhibitors DACT2 and SFRP2. This study identifies KSRP as an oncogenic factor in FTC that activates Wnt/β-catenin signalling, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for FTC patients.",

    "abstract": "As the non-coding genome remains poorly characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we aimed to identify and functionally characterize novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) relevant to AML biology and treatment. We first identified lncRNAs overexpressed in AML blasts and, among them, discovered a novel transcript, which we named myeloid and AML-associated intergenic long non-coding RNA (MALNC). MALNC is overexpressed in AML, particularly in cases with the PML-RARA fusion or IDH2<sup>R140</sup>/NPM1 co-mutations, and is associated with a distinct gene expression profile. Functional studies showed that MALNC knockout impairs AML cell proliferation and colony formation, enhances ATRA-induced differentiation, and sensitizes cells to arsenic trioxide. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MALNC loss alters the expression of retinoic acid pathway genes, and chromatin binding studies showed that MALNC binds to genes related to the retinoic acid and Rho GTPase pathways. In conclusion, we have identified MALNC as a novel lncRNA that promotes leukemic cell proliferation, counteracts ATRA-induced differentiation, and modulates drug sensitivity in AML.",

    "abstract": "The adaptor protein SRCIN1 is a novel Src-binding protein that regulates Src activation through C-terminal Src kinase. SRCIN1 has been shown to promote the development of colorectal cancer, while acting as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, its role in the development of thyroid cancer has remained unknown. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics of SRCIN1 in thyroid cancer using public data (HPA, TIMER, GEPIA and UALCAN). Additionally, we investigated the biological impact of SRCIN1 knockdown and overexpression on thyroid cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed that the expression of SRCIN1 was higher (more than twice) in thyroid cancer tissues than in normal tissues and was positively correlated with tumor stage (stage1 vs. stage4 p < 0.05). Suppression of SRCIN1 promoted cell apoptosis (at least onefold) and inhibited cell proliferation and migration (at least 50%), whereas overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that SRCIN1 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis, as evidenced by increased levels of β-catenin, DVL2, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and Axin2. TOP/FOP experiments also revealed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated by SRCIN1. It is noteworthy that the specific knockdown of SRCIN1 results in a reduction of key downstream gene targets within the Wnt/β-catenin axis, and tumors in mice treated with SRCIN1-targeting siRNA exhibit significantly smaller volumes (reduction exceeding 50%). Taken together, our study highlights the clinical and therapeutic relevance of SRCIN1 in thyroid cancer and suggests it as a potential therapeutic target for this disease.",

RAS protein activator-like 2 (RASAL2) regulates RAS signaling by catalyzing the conversion of RAS. This study investigates the pathogenicity of the germline RASAL2 c.2423 A > G variant, identified in a high-risk family, and its potential role in CRC progression and therapy resistance. Population analysis reveals its rarity in East Asians (0.01%) but an increased prevalence in Taiwanese CRC patients (1.63%). Functional studies demonstrate that RASAL2 c.2423 A > G enhances RAS signaling, causing sustained ERK phosphorylation and increased CRC cell proliferation. Additionally, RASAL2-mutant cells require higher doses of cetuximab for ERK suppression and growth inhibition, indicating resistance to anti-EGFR therapy via abnormal RAS activation. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria, the variant is likely pathogenic.

However, direct mechanical insight is required to illustrate the contribution of intestinal microflora in the disease progression. In this study, we aimed to precisely assess the changes in intestinal bacteria translocation (IBT) from gut to the pancreas using combinations of FISH, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and deep learning-assisted methods to track IBT in diet-induced obese (DIO) and antibiotic-induced microbiota disruption (AIMD)-DIO mouse models. Our analysis showed deep learning-assisted quantification enhanced the accuracy and objectivity of bacterial tracking. The DIO mice exhibited increased IBT, likely due to excessive intestinal lipid accumulation and compromised intestinal barrier integrity. Elevated bacterial loads in the pancreas were associated with worsened pancreatic function, indicated by higher fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and dysfunctional insulin secretion. In contrast, the AIMD-DIO group lowered the IBT, maintained the islet structure and improved glucose homeostasis. Comparative study between DIO and AIMD-DIO models revealed a strong correlation between number of translocated bacteria and T2DM severity. These findings provide objective evidence of bacterial migration from the intestine to the pancreas and establishes its pathological relationship with pancreatic impairment and dysfunction and underscores to utilize AI techniques more successfully in the future for evaluating IBT.",

    "abstract": "DNA integrity is constantly challenged by both endogenous and exogenous damaging agents, resulting in various forms of damage. Failure to repair DNA accurately leads to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. Distinct pathways exist to repair different types of DNA damage. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent a particularly severe form of damage, due to the physical separation of DNA strands. The repair of DSBs requires the activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and the generation of Damage-responsive transcripts (DARTs). Here we show that the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C-methyltransferase NSUN2 localises to DSBs in a transcription-dependent manner, where it binds to and methylates DARTs. The depletion of NSUN2 results in an accumulation of nascent primary DARTs around DSBs. Furthermore, we detect an RNA-dependent interaction between NSUN2 and DICER, which is stimulated by DNA damage. NSUN2 activity promotes DICER cleavage of DARTs-associated R-loops, which is required for efficient DNA repair. We report a role of the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C -methyltransferase NSUN2 within the RNA-dependent DNA damage response, highlighting its function as a DICER chaperone for the clearance of non-canonical substrates such as DARTs, thereby contributing to genomic integrity.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory perception of food odors is a key determinant of eating behavior, including triggering appetite, facilitating food seeking and influencing food choice. While transient food-related olfactory cues stimulate appetite and provoke cravings in states of hunger, emerging evidence implies that prolonged and sustained exposure to food-derived odor (FO) suppresses feeding. However, the mechanisms by which olfaction induces hypophagia remain elusive. In this study, we show that prolonged FO exposure significantly suppresses food intake in male mice. We identified a subset of neurons in the ventral subiculum (vSub) that are specifically activated by FO. We further discovered that these FO-activated neurons in the vSub receive excitatory inputs from the olfactory bulb (OB) and send glutamatergic projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Inhibition of the OB → vSub → VMH circuit abolished the FO-induced reduction in food intake, while activation of this circuit suppressed feeding and reduced body weight. Together, these findings reveal a neurobiological circuitry that mediates the influence of olfactory signals on food intake regulation.",

    "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses represent an innovative strategy for cancer therapy. However, extensive gene expression reprogramming within tumor cells may hinder viral propagation by affecting essential cell-virus interactions. Here, through genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening, Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2), a histone methyltransferase, was identified as a critical factor in mediating resistance to oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (oHSV-1) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Functional studies in SCC15 cells revealed that SUV39H2 knockdown facilitated viral replication, while its overexpression suppressed it. The inhibitor OTS186935 targeting SUV39H2 was administered to evaluate its effects on viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment with OTS186935 in SCC15, SCC7, and MCF7 led to a significant enhancement of viral replication. Combined treatment with OTS186935 and oHSV-1 demonstrated significant anti-tumor efficacy in BALB/c nude mice bearing SCC15 tumors. SUV39H2 was shown to regulate the trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3) at the viral promoter regions of immediate-early gene ICP0, ICP4 and early gene ICP8, thereby repressed viral gene transcription. However, oHSV-1 infection induced the degradation of SUV39H2, a process mediated by the viral protein ICP0 through the proteasomal pathway. Findings from studies in SCC7 cells further supported the observation that SUV39H2 knockdown enhanced viral replication. Moreover, SUV39H2 downregulation increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in syngeneic tumors treated with oHSV-1. TCGA database analysis revealed that SUV39H2 is associated with distinct immune cell infiltration patterns across different cancer types and correlates with immune checkpoint expression. These results highlight the role of SUV39H2 in regulating oHSV-1 replication and indicate that SUV39H2 may represent a potential target to improve the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy.",

This cohort study included 123,228 participants with metabolic dysfunction--associated steatotic liver disease from the UK Biobank, who had detailed sleep assessment at baseline. The healthy sleep pattern was constructed by a composite healthy sleep score that incorporated different sleep behaviors. Incident cardiovascular disease, liver-related events, and all-cause mortality were identified from hospital inpatient records and death register systems. Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were applied to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During a 15.45 person-years of follow-up, we recorded 20,287 cardiovascular disease events, 1304 liver-related events, and 10,306 deaths in patients with metabolic dysfunction--associated steatotic liver disease. Compared with participants with a poor sleep pattern, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for participants with a healthy sleep pattern were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.67-0.77) for cardiovascular disease, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.57-0.94) for liver-related events, and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96) for all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic splines indicated a significant linear association between healthy sleep scores and cardiovascular disease, liver-related events, and all-cause mortality in patients with metabolic dysfunction--associated steatotic liver disease. Our findings suggest that patients with metabolic dysfunction--associated steatotic liver disease who maintained healthy sleep patterns were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, liver-related events, and mortality, highlighting the importance of favorable sleep patterns in the prevention of intrahepatic/extrahepatic events in individuals with metabolic dysfunction--associated steatotic liver disease.",

We performed high-dimensional imaging mass cytometry on synovial tissues from healthy controls, patients with osteoarthritis, and patients with early RA longitudinally before and after 6 months of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) therapy. Findings were validated using whole-tissue RNA-sequencing and immunofluorescence in larger patient cohorts, and integrated with ligand-receptor analyses from public single-cell RNA-seq datasets and in vitro functional coculture assays. Our deep spatial profiling pinpointed a critical LYVE1<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>tissue-resident macrophage network, localised within perivascular niches alongside fibroblasts and vascular cells. This homeostatic network was disrupted in active RA but restored in patients responding well to csDMARDs.

Functionally, LYVE1<sup>+</sup> macrophages demonstrated a regulatory, anti-inflammatory phenotype in vitro, contrasting with proinflammatory myeloid cells.

The study assesses their predictive value for response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) combined with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi). A multicenter, retrospective real-world study conducted across 6 oncology hospitals in Bulgaria. Patient data were obtained through a formal request to the Ministry of Health's United Information Portal, an electronic health records repository. The analysis included mCRPC patients treated with olaparib plus abiraterone who underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) between January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2025, conducted in a certified national reference laboratory, with a median follow-up of 16 months. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 210 mCRPC patients screened via NGS, 28% (n = 58) harbored mutations in at least one HRR gene, classified as sensor (n = 27) or effector (n = 31). Patients with effector mutations demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to those with sensor mutations (median PFS: 20 vs. 14 months, HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.252-0.914, P = .0294). Similarly, overall survival (OS) was significantly prolonged in the effector group. While the median OS for the sensor group was 19 months, the effector group had not yet reached median OS at the time of analysis (HR = 0.38, 95% CI, 0.154-0.945, P = .0373). Logistic regression analysis and PSM supported findings. Patients with mCRPC harboring effector HRR mutations derive greater clinical benefit from PARPi plus ARSi than those with sensor mutations. These findings highlight the heterogeneous predictive value of HRR gene alterations and suggest that mutation sub-class should guide treatment decisions in HRD-positive mCRPC.",

Subsequently, predictive models using random forest were trained and evaluated through stratified cross-validation and metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Cox regression was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality and relapse. Four clusters with distinct risk profiles were identified. Overall mortality was 28.8%, and relapse occurred in 40.9%, with a median follow-up time of 8.46 years. The highest-risk group exhibited a mortality rate of 42.3% and a relapse rate of 54.2%, associated with poorer functional status (ECOG ≥3) and a high prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations (71%). The random forest model achieved 80% accuracy in mortality prediction (AUC = 0.78) and 75% accuracy in relapse prediction (AUC = 0.76). Factors such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index, ECOG, BRCA1/2 status, and PD-L1 expression were key determinants in outcome prediction. The findings confirm the relevance of machine learning in TNBC stratification. A clinically meaningful classification was achieved, outperforming traditional models based solely on clinical or genomic variables. Comorbid burden and tumor biomarkers played crucial roles in outcome prediction. Despite its strengths, the study has limitations, including its retrospective nature and the absence of transcriptomic data. Prospective validation of these models could enhance their applicability in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Short-Term Prediction Model for Breast Cancer Risk Based on One Million Medical Records.",
    "abstract": "Despite progress in breast cancer screening many women are diagnosed with advanced stage. We sought to develop a short-term (one year) prediction model for breast cancer risk, based on readily available data from electronic medical records (EMRs), to support decision-making. A retrospective cohort study using data of 1,039,212 members of a large healthcare organization between the years 1985 and 2021. During the study years, 18,959 people were diagnosed with breast cancer. Longitudinal personal medical information such as demographics, cancer-related family history, smoking habits, medical history, fertility treatments, surgeries, biopsies, medications, BMI, blood pressure and lab tests was used to predict the outcome: breast cancer diagnosis one year from the recorded data. Prediction models were trained using the CatBoost decision tree methodology. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to estimate the marginal impact of a feature on the model performance, considering the other features. The model includes numerous features not utilized in existing breast cancer risk models (e.g., medications, systolic blood pressure, TSH levels and more), available from the EMR. The informative features, ranked by SHAP values, include age, the number of surgical consultations and the number of breast biopsies. The model achieved high performance with an area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.85. Use of data readily available from the EMR, can assist clinicians when assessing the short-term breast cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "Routine brain imaging screening (BIS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (BC) without neurological symptoms is currently not recommended, as no survival/quality-of-life improvements have been demonstrated. We aimed to examine physicians and patients' attitudes and perceptions toward BIS. International cross-sectional online survey for patients and physicians, distributed from May 2023 to February 2024. Patients with BC diagnosis were deemed eligible for patients' survey completion and BC-treating physicians were invited to fill the physicians' questionnaire. A total of 529 physicians from 50 countries (80 % European) responded, mostly medical oncologists (70 %) working in academic hospitals (53 %). Most physicians request BIS (65 %), mainly when extracranial progression occurs, especially for HER2+ and triple negative BC (TNBC). Among physicians never performing BIS (35 %), 91 % would in case of proved clinical benefit. A total of 545 patients from 14 European countries completed the questionnaire. Median age was 50 years, 86 % had metastatic BC, 51 % hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative, 30 % HER2-positive (HER2+) and 19 % TNBC. BM were diagnosed in 11.5 % patients with metastatic BC. 85 % patients would like to undergo BIS, especially younger ones (p = 0.02) and with HR-disease (p = 0.03), despite the uncertain clinical benefit. Notably, 91 % of patients would like to receive information regarding BM, while only 13 % of physicians routinely address the issue. These results underline the willingness of patients to know more about the prospects of BM development, in contrast to the lack of routine discussion of this topic by physicians. Further investigation is warranted to demonstrate the clinical utility of routine BIS.",

    "title": "Association of eating duration less than 8 h with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.",
    "abstract": "To assess the association between eating duration less than 8 h and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Adult participants who reported usual intake from two valid 24-h dietary recalls were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2003-2018 (n = 19,831). Mortality status as of December 2019 was obtained through linkage to the National Death Index. Average eating duration was categorized as <8, 8-<10, 10-<12, 12-14 h (mean duration), >14-16, and >16 h. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were derived. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, compared with eating duration of 12-14 h, eating duration <8 h was robustly associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.35 [95 % CI, 1.39-3.98]), but not with all-cause and cancer mortality. The positive association with cardiovascular mortality remained consistent across 8 subgroups stratified by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, and smoking status, and survived 14 sensitivity analyses. However, the association with all-cause mortality did not survive many sensitivity analyses. Although a positive association was observed between eating duration <8 h and cardiovascular mortality, further research is required to understand whether this risk is attributed to the short eating duration itself or residual confounding resulting from its contributing factors.",

    "title": "Renal surgery following HIF-2α antagonist therapy: Surgical indications, outcomes and growth kinetics.",
    "abstract": "The development of HIF-2α antagonists marked an advancement in the treatment of localized VHL-deficient kidney cancer; however, their impact on subsequent surgical interventions remains unexplored. This study investigated the indications for and outcomes of patients undergoing renal surgery after exposure to HIF-2α antagonists and the growth rates (GR) of their index renal tumors. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent renal surgery at a single institution following or during treatment with a HIF-2α antagonist. Data regarding the clinicopathologic characteristics, therapy management, and surgical outcomes were collected. Index tumor GRs before, during and after drug administration were calculated and compared. Twenty-seven patients underwent 28 surgeries after exposure to a HIF-2α antagonist from 2015 to 2023, with a total of 82 tumors removed. About 24 patients were treated with Belzutifan, and 3 patients were treated with PT2385, with 26 patients having a diagnosis of VHL syndrome. The median time on therapy prior to surgery was 14.7 months, with a median washout time of drug to surgery of 10 days. Median preoperative hemoglobin prior to surgery was 11.6 g/dL. Two blood transfusions were administered, 1 intraoperatively and 1 postoperatively. Seven postoperative complications were noted, 2 of which were ≥ Grade 3. The median index tumor GR prior to treatment was 0.37 cm/y, 0.46 cm/y during treatment, and 0.54 cm/y post-treatment. There was no significant difference in GRs between the groups. Median time to restart HIF-2α antagonist after surgery was 43 days. Limitations of this study include retrospective nature, single center, and lack of control group. Renal surgery after or during exposure to a HIF-2α antagonist is safe and feasible, with rates of both transfusions and complications commensurate with the reported literature from standard renal surgery. GRs of index renal tumors that eventually needed surgical intervention did not show a significant difference before, during, and after therapy. Tumors exhibiting a positive GR on drug may represent the indication that drives early surgical intervention prior to the tumor reaching the 3 cm threshold. A median washout time of 10 days from last dose of HIF-2α antagonist to surgery was safe and well tolerated.",

    "title": "Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens: Biomarker discovery and clinical application.",
    "abstract": "Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) are carbohydrate structures uniquely expressed on the surface of tumor cells while being absent or minimally present in normal tissues. These molecular signatures play crucial roles in tumor progression, contributing to essential processes such as cell adhesion, motility, invasion, immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. TACAs arise due to aberrant glycosylation, a hallmark of cancer cells, leading to their overexpression in various malignancies. Notably, elevated levels of certain TACAs have been associated with poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Because of their selective expression, TACAs serve as important biomarkers for cancer detection, prognosis, and disease monitoring. Their presence in the bloodstream of patients with epithelial carcinomas, neuroblastomas, and melanomas has led to the development of assays capable of quantifying these antigens in sera, providing valuable tools for clinical applications. The ability to measure TACAs in biological fluids enables early diagnosis and improved patient management, making them attractive targets for liquid biopsy strategies. Beyond their diagnostic utility, TACAs hold great promise for therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer immunotherapy. Their restricted expression on cancer cells makes them ideal targets for vaccine development, monoclonal antibody therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell approaches. By exploiting the immune system's ability to recognize and target these antigens, novel treatment strategies are being explored to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Continued research into TACAs may lead to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, improving cancer patient outcomes and broadening the scope of precision medicine.",
