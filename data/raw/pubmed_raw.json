    "title": "GUCY1A1-LDHA Axis Suppresses Ferroptosis in Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.",
    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury compromises revascularization strategies for myocardial infarction and contributes to cardiac microvascular disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of the sGC (soluble guanylate cyclase)-cGMP-PKG (protein kinase G) pathway in cardiac microvascular reperfusion injury with a focus on ferroptosis. Key genes in the sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway were analyzed at different reperfusion times using bulk and single-cell mRNA sequencing. Endothelial cell (EC) specific conditional GUCY1A1 (guanylate cyclase soluble subunit alpha 1) knockout mice (GUCY1A1flox/flox/-CreERT2) and adeno-associated virus transfer-induced EC-specific GUCY1A1-overexpressing mice were assessed for cardiac microvascular reperfusion injury. LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A) and GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4) phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry and mutationally inactivated via the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated protein 9) system. Protein interactions and chaperone-mediated autophagy of GPX4 were detected using coimmunoprecipitation assays. GUCY1A1 was decreased in the EC group after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. EC-specific knockout of GUCY1A1 further reduced microvascular perfusion, increased the no-reflow area, and enlarged the infarction area in the acute phase of ischemia-reperfusion injury, ultimately aggravating cardiac dysfunction and structural remodeling in the chronic phase. In contrast, GUCY1A1 overexpression or its activator, vericiguat, alleviated microvascular dysfunction via the suppression of endothelial ferroptosis; the effects were majorly dependent on PKG activity. Mechanistically, PKG phosphorylated LDHA at threonine 95 and activated the LDHA moonlighting kinase function to phosphorylate GPX4, resulting in reduced chaperone-mediated autophagy-dependent degradation of GPX4 and ferroptosis. In human ischemic cardiomyopathy, GUCY1A1 expression, LDHA phosphorylation at threonine 95, and GPX4 phosphorylation at serine 131 were negatively associated with lipid peroxidation and cardiac fibrosis, suggesting that this pathway was involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings indicate that the compromise of the sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway is associated with reduced phosphorylation of LDHA and GPX4, and that GUCY1A1 activation may be considered as a strategy to alleviate endothelial ferroptosis and cardiac microvascular reperfusion injury.",

    "title": "FAP deficiency attenuates T2DM-associated HFpEF by suppressing the CaMKIIδ-﻿Calcineurin A-NFATc2 signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents the initial phase of cardiac dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM-induced HFpEF are complex and elusive. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a prolyl-specific serine protease that its inhibition or vaccination has been shown to enhance cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role and underlying molecular mechanisms by which abnormal FAP activity promotes the development of T2DM-induced HFpEF remain to be elucidated. In this study, the plasma activity and level of FAP were significantly higher in the T2DM with HFpEF group compared to the healthy control group. Moreover, plasma FAP activity and level were positively correlated with the likelihood of T2DM with HFpEF. To investigate the mechanistic involvement of FAP in the development of T2DM-associated HFpEF, a chronic T2DM mouse model was established. The results revealed that FAP KO significantly improved BNP level and E/A ratios compared to the WT T2DM group. Additionally, FAP KO and FAP inhibitor Talabostat alleviated myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism dysfunction. Mechanistically, abnormal increase FAP triggered the CaMKIIδ-Calcineurin A-NFATc2 signaling pathway, leading to the aforementioned pathological changes in T2DM-induced HFpEF. In contrast, FAP KO suppressed the CaMKIIδ-Calcineurin A-NFATc2 signaling pathway and attenuated these pathological changes. Overall, these findings suggest that FAP may serve as a critical therapeutic target for T2DM-induced HFpEF.",

    "abstract": "Routine invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but the rate of adherence to this recommendation in Australia is not known. We sought to quantify the proportion of patients who undergo ICA and revascularization in a contemporary cohort of NSTEMI patients, and to determine predictors of clinical outcome. This was a population-based cohort study of consecutive patients transported by emergency medical services (EMS) in Victoria, Australia with chest pain who were diagnosed with NSTEMI between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2019. Ambulance data were linked to hospital admission, emergency department, and mortality records. There were 11,040 patients attended by EMS with NSTEMI, of which 5379 patients (48.7%) underwent ICA, with 2798 patients (25.3%) proceeding to coronary revascularization. Patients who underwent ICA were younger, more frequently male, less comorbid, and more likely to originate from a major city and a higher socioeconomic status compared to those who did not. Patients who underwent ICA had lower short- and long-term mortality, and coronary angiography was independently associated with reduced mortality on Cox-regression analysis (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.41-0.50, p < 0.001). Less than half of ambulance-transported patients with NSTEMI underwent ICA, and only a quarter of the cohort received revascularization, despite there being a survival benefit with invasive management. Although patients who do not undergo ICA are older and more comorbid, there are potentially modifiable barriers to access to care, including socioeconomic status, rurality, and sex.",

    "title": "Adherence Patterns of Patients Using Remote Patient Management After Myocardial Infarction: Mixed Methods Persona Approach.",
    "abstract": "Remote patient management (RPM) using smartphone-enabled health monitoring devices (SHMDs) can be an effective, value-added part of cardiovascular care. However, cardiac patients' adherence to RPM is variable. Personas are fictional representations of users with common behaviors, needs, and motivation and can thereby help guide tailoring of interventions to be meaningful and possibly more effective. Personas can be used to understand the needs of the patient group and guide tailoring toward more personalized and effective eHealth intervention. The aim of this study was to develop data-driven personas for patients with myocardial infarction (MI) based on both quantitative and qualitative results. This study used a mixed methods design involving (1) database analysis of patients with MI (N=261) SHMD usage data (blood pressure [BP], weight, step count) over the course of a one-year care track and (2) semistructured interviews with patients with MI (N=16) currently using SHMDs. Overall, 12-month adherence rates were calculated based on the number of weeks patients performed the prescribed home measurements with the SHMDs. A cluster analysis was conducted on the self-monitoring data resulting in four distinctive usage patterns labeled as stiff starting (low adherent in first 6 weeks: 13%, 34/261 of users), temporary persisting (decreasing adherence: 24%, 62/261), loyally persisting (continuously adherent: 26%, 68/261), and negligent quitting (nonadherent: 37%, 97/261). Health outcomes (BP, step count, and weight) were analyzed based on these patterns. More adherent usage patterns show better controlled BP when compared to less adherent usage patterns, suggesting that adherence is associated with health outcomes. Patient experiences regarding adherence or nonadherence to the RPM relating to the four distinctive usage patterns were uncovered by means of semistructured interviews, providing insight into adherence factors most relevant for each of the clusters. Thus, 4 distinct personas were developed by data collection (database analysis and semistructured interviews), persona segmentation, and persona creation, named Tamara, Sam, Peter, and Kim. This study identified 4 personas regarding adherence experiences and usage patterns of patients within an RPM care track. Adherent usage patterns were characterized by improved BP and step count. These personas can guide future tailoring of eHealth interventions to maximize patient adherence.",

    "abstract": "Mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) remains high despite advanced treatment strategies in CS patients, underlining the need for the identification of predictors of prognosis in CS patients. Therefore, the present study investigates the prognostic impact of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) in patients with CS. All consecutive patients being acutely admitted with CS to an intensive care unit (ICU) and undergoing invasive coronary angiography (ICA) from 2019 to 2021 were included, irrespective of the etiology of CS. Patients with at least one CTO were compared to non-CTO patients with regard to the risk of all-cause mortality at 30 days. Further risk stratification was performed according to the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 192 CS patients undergoing ICA during index hospitalization were included. At least one CTO was present in 24% of CS patients. Patients with CTO were older (median 78 vs. 68; p = 0.001) and presented more frequently with non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (21% vs. 12%; p = 0.048). The presence of a CTO was associated with higher rates of 30-days all-cause mortality (70.2% vs. 47.6%; HR = 1.783, 95% CI 1.176-2.702; p = 0.009), even after multivariable adjustment (adjusted HR = 1.898; 95% CI 1.116-3.229; p = 0.018). Patients with CTO were accompanied by an even higher 30-days all-cause mortality as compared to patients with multi-vessel CAD without CTO (adjusted HR = 1.723; 95% CI 1.058-2.805; p = 0.029). Coronary CTO are common in patients with CS and represent an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at 30 days.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), conferring a markedly increased risk of thromboembolic events. Conventional risk stratification tools such as the CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [doubled], diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack [doubled], vascular disease, age 65-74 years, female sex) score are often insufficient to predict thromboembolic events in patients with HCM and AF, as thromboembolic risk in HCM is driven by disease-specific structural, functional, and prothrombotic substrates. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical impact of AF and thromboembolism in HCM. We discuss variable imaging modalities-including strain echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and cardiac computed tomography-that offer enhanced characterization of atrial remodeling and thromboembolic risk in patients with HCM. Furthermore, we outline current guideline-based anticoagulation strategies, the evolving role of direct oral anticoagulants, and adjunctive therapies such as left atrial appendage occlusion and catheter ablation. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that incorporates advanced imaging, molecular profiling, and individualized management is ideal to optimize outcomes and reduce stroke burden in patients with HCM and AF.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction and worsens outcomes. Despite advances in care, mortality rate disparities regarding gender, race and socioeconomic status persist. This study examines trends in acute myocardial infarction-related mortality among chronic kidney disease patients in the United States from 1999 to 2020. We analyzed mortality data from the CDC WONDER database, identifying deaths with acute myocardial infarction (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes I21-I22) as the underlying cause and chronic kidney disease (ICD-10 N18) as a contributing cause. Age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000, standardized to the 2000 US population, were calculated and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and state. Trends were assessed using Joinpoint regression to estimate annual percentage change with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 72,780 acute myocardial infarction-related deaths in chronic kidney disease patients aged 25-85 years occurred from 1999 to 2020. The age adjusted mortality rate declined from 2.46 in 1999 to 0.99 in 2020 (annual percent change: -4.09; 95% CI -5.54 to -2.60). Men had higher mortality than women (age adjusted mortality rate: 2.11 vs. 1.13). Non-Hispanic Black individuals had the highest age adjusted mortality rate (2.90). Nonmetropolitan areas showed higher rates than metropolitan areas (1.63 vs. 1.51). A significant increase in mortality was observed among Hispanic patients from 2015 to 2020 (annual percent change: 8.15; 95% CI 1.13-15.65). Acute myocardial infarction-related mortality in chronic kidney disease patients has declined overall, but persistent disparities by sex, race/ethnicity, and geography highlight the need for continued efforts and targeted interventions in this high-risk population.",

However, the relationship between CHIP and clinical outcome as well as pathological phenotype of patients with acute myocardial infarction was unknown. Herein, we aimed to investigate the associations between CHIP mutation stratified by variant allele frequency (VAF) from 0.5% to 2% and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as well as the characteristics of culprit lesions in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Targeted deep sequencing with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) was used to examine CHIP with VAFs greater than 0.5%, 1%, and 2% in prospective cohort including a total of 1403 patients with STEMI, and MACE including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unplanned revascularization during follow-up was recorded. In addition, the morphology of culprit plaques detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 355 patients with de novo lesions were evaluated via image analysis. The CHIP mutation frequency in each VAF stratification increased with increasing age. Patients with either TET2 or ASXL1 CHIP mutations presented significantly greater mortality than those without for VAF > 2%, 1%, and 0.5% (17.1% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.0001; 17.0% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.0464; and 17.8% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.0025 for VAF > 2%, 1%, and 0.5%, respectively). For other MACE including myocardial infarction, stroke and unplanned revascularization, no significant difference was observed. Simultaneous assessment of CHIP and systemic inflammation revealed combined effects on all-cause mortality, depicted by significant higher risk for patients with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level > 5.8 mg/L and concomitant CHIP. Moreover, subgroup analysis revealed that patients with CHIP mutations got greater clinical benefit of ticagrelor and statin than those without CHIP. Additionally, patients with TET2/ASXL1 VAFs of > 0.5% and 1% were significantly prone to exhibit a greater prevalence of ruptured fibrous cap in culprit lesions than those without (33 [70.2%] vs. 145 [47.1%], p = 0.0031; 16 [72.7%] vs. 162 [48.6%], p = 0.0287). TET2/ASXL1 CHIP mutations with VAF > 2% combined with high inflammatory status were indicative of high mortality in patients with STEMI. Additionally, TET2/ASXL1 mutation with a VAF > 0.5% favored the recognition of vulnerable plaque features in patients with STEMI.",

    "abstract": "Efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic cells are recognized and removed by phagocytes, plays a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating inflammatory responses. Over recent decades, an increasing number of studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of efferocytosis. This bibliometric analysis aims to map the evolving trends, identify key contributors, and outline emerging research themes in this field. A comprehensive search was conducted in Web of Science database, to collect literature related to efferocytosis from 2006 to 2024. The dataset was analyzed using several tools such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Analyses included evaluation of publication trends, citation networks, keyword co-occurrence, and co-cited references. Key metrics such as the most prolific authors, top contributing countries, and major research clusters were identified to understand the field's evolution and interdisciplinary collaborations. The final dataset comprised 1549 scholarly works, consisting of 1166 original research articles and 383 review papers. The analysis revealed a steady increase in the number of publications concerning efferocytosis, particularly in the past decade. Geographically, China and the United States emerged as dominant contributors, representing over 64.4% of total publications. Among institutions, Harvard University demonstrated the highest research output in this field. Keyword analysis demonstrated the current research focus including molecular mechanisms and signaling regulation of efferocytosis, macrophage polarization and inflammatory modulation, pathological implications and therapeutic potential of efferocytosis in diseases. Inflammation, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and COPD are diseases that has received the most attention in this field. Several research topics including nanoparticle, neuroinflammation, fibrosis, immunometabolism, exosomes, apoptotic bodies, mesenchymal stem cells, aging, microglia, reactive oxygen species, CD47, lipid metabolism, immunotherapy, mitochondria, ferroptosis, may have great potential to be hot topics in the near future. Gene-focused investigations identified TNF, MERTK, IL10, LI6, and IL1b as the most extensively studied genetic elements in efferocytosis research. This bibliometric study provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving research landscape in efferocytosis. These insights not only highlight the current milestones but also serve as a valuable guide for future research and policy-making aimed at harnessing efferocytosis for therapeutic innovations.",

Trans-carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has emerged as a newer alternative designed to reduce the risk of procedural stroke. However, comparative evidence on the safety and efficacy of these interventions is limited. This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of CEA, CAS, and TCAR in patients with carotid artery stenosis. A comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. The outcomes were stroke, mortality, and myocardial infarction, cranial nerve injury, hematoma, infection, transient ischemic attack, and length of hospital stay. Meta-analysis and a frequentist graph-theoretical approach network meta-analysis were performed using the netmeta package in R platform. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 Cochrane and ROBINS-I. Fifty-five studies were included in the review. The short-term stroke risk was significantly lower with CEA than with CAS. TCAR had a potential long-term mortality benefit over CAS, while no significant differences were observed in short-term mortality or myocardial infarction across treatments. CAS was associated with lower risks of cranial nerve injury, hematoma, and infection compared with CEA. CEA and TCAR offer better short-term stroke protection than CAS, with TCAR showing promise for long-term mortality benefits. CAS has advantages in reducing cranial nerve injury, hematoma, and infection risks. Overall, the choice of treatment should consider both efficacy and safety profiles. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials, particularly focusing on TCAR, are needed to validate these comparative outcomes. CRD420251055287.",

To investigate the existence of disparities within MI-related locations of deaths in the United States. Data on death certificates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC-WONDER) was utilized to evaluate trends in the locations of MI-related mortality from 1999 to 2020.

    "abstract": "Smartphone- and tablet-based apps have been increasingly used in the management of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with the goal of enhancing care efficiency. These apps facilitate improved team coordination through a single platform, enabling secure sharing of clinical data, arrival times, and enabling data storage and processing capabilities. The potential of these technologies to reduce reperfusion times and improve both clinical and process outcomes, compared to traditional communication methods, is promising. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions in reducing door-to-balloon (D2B) time, first medical contact-to-balloon (FMC2B) time, mortality, and false activation rates in STEMI care pathways. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO framework for eligibility criteria. Studies were included if they compared smartphone- or tablet-enabled interventions with usual care for STEMI management, focusing on D2B time, FMC2B time, short-term mortality, and false activation rates. A systematic literature search was conducted across MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2008 and 2024. Studies using purpose-built software or commercially available instant messaging apps that enabled digital ECG transfer and real-time communication between providers were included. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023481024). Data synthesis was performed using SPSS (IBM) with random-effects meta-analysis for continuous and binary outcomes. A total of 903 articles were identified after removing duplicates, and 21 studies, involving 3267 patients, were included. Studies varied in design: 14 being retrospective and 7 prospective, conducted across 12 countries. Thirteen studies evaluated dedicated apps, and 8 used instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp (Meta Platforms Inc) and WeChat (Tencent Holdings Ltd). The primary outcome, D2B time, showed a significant reduction in the intervention group (mean difference -19.11 mins, 95% CI -26.22 to -12.00; P<.01), with substantial heterogeneity (I²=89%). A similar reduction in FMC2B time was observed (mean difference -19.85 minutes, 95% CI -29.45 to -20.25; P=.01). Subgroup analysis indicated a more pronounced reduction in D2B time in low-income countries compared to high-income countries. There were no significant differences regarding short-term mortality (risk difference -0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01; P=.10). False activation rates were evaluated in 7 studies, with varying results, but no pooled analysis was feasible due to differences in definitions and study design. The health care setting (ie, low- or high-income countries) was the most significant factor contributing to the observed heterogeneity in the meta-regression analysis. Smartphone-based interventions significantly reduce reperfusion times in STEMI care pathways. Digital technology can improve the efficiency of STEMI management, particularly with lower-resource health care infrastructure. Future studies should explore the impact on long-term outcomes and investigate regional differences in treatment effects.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of cardiovascular health (CVH), genetic predisposition, and their interactions on new-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among individuals with prediabetes. We assessed 26,962 individuals with prediabetes from the UK Biobank. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) was utilized to measure CVH. LE8 score encompasses 4 health behaviors (diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep) and 4 health factors (body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure). Polygenic risk score (PRS) was utilized to evaluate genetic predisposition. Cox regression analyses were applied to explore the associations of LE8 score and PRS with new-onset T2D, CVD, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Higher LE8 score was associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes (hazard ratios [HRs] ranging from 0.26 to 0.72) after multivariate adjustment. Even a 1-point increment in LE8 score was significantly linked to decreased risk of adverse outcomes in participants with prediabetes (HRs ranging from 0.97 to 0.99). A substantial proportion of incident T2D (70.47%) and CVD (45.12%) cases could be attributable to low LE8 score. Higher PRS was significantly associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes (HRs ranging from 1.38 to 3.68). Compared with those who had a low LE8 score and high PRS, participants with a high LE8 score and low PRS had lower risk of T2D, CVD, MI, and stroke. Participants with low PRS benefited more from adherence to LE8 concerning incident T2D. Besides, further analysis suggested that BMI, blood pressure, and nicotine exposure have the greatest contribution to incident T2D and CVD during the prediabetes stage. Ideal CVH was associated with lower risk of incident T2D and CVD among individuals with prediabetes, irrespective of their genetic predisposition. If all metrics could not be improved at once, achieving ideal status of BMI and blood pressure and avoiding nicotine exposure should be prioritized.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become the preferred method in the treatment of aortic arch diseases by now. Due to the complex anatomical structure and reconstruction techniques, it is difficult to perform total endovascular aortic arch treatment for patients with aortic arch lesions. Our team initiates the reconstruction of aortic arch vessels using the surgically assisted short-distance retrograde needle puncture (SDRNP) technique for three-fenestration stent grafts. This article aims to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of performing the SDRNP technique for three-fenestration stent grafts in treating aortic aneurysm, dissection, or penetrating ulcer involving the aortic arch. A retrospective review was performed on 12 patients with aortic arch diseases, who underwent surgically assisted SDRNP technique for three-fenestration stent grafts to revascularize supra-arch branches. The overall technical success rate was 100.0% (12/12). The average operative time and intraoperative bleeding were 228.5 ± 69.6 min and 74.5 ± 26.9 mL, respectively. Complications consisted of 1 stroke, 1 acute myocardial infarction, and 2 endoleaks (1 type III and 1 type I). The patient with type III endoleaks improved after coil embolization after re-intervention. There were no aorta-related deaths during the average follow-up of 10.3 ± 2.8 months. All of the bridging stents were patent, with no migration. The three-fenestration stent grafts using the surgically assisted SDRNP technique offer a great advance for the treatment of aortic arch diseases, which might be an ideal operation process for aortic arch vessels.",

    "abstract": "Despite its high incidence and mortality, the level of evidence for cardiogenic shock (CS) treatments remains very low. This study aims to evaluate the influence of early treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) in CS. FRENSHOCK is a prospective registry including 772 CS patients from 49 centres. The association between early MRA use and 30-day all-cause mortality was assessed in a 1:3 propensity-matched cohort. Early MRA use was defined as documented use within 24 h of admission. Among the 693 CS patients included, MRAs were used in 91 (13.1%). Patients treated with MRA presented with a more frequent history of cardiac disease (78.0% vs. 56.0%, p < 0.01) and had lower LVEF (20.0% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.01). After matching, 91 patients treated with MRA were compared to 273 patients who did not receive MRA. MRA use was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality, with a matched HR of 0.49 (0.27-0.91), p = 0.02. In subgroup analysis, the benefit of MRA appeared more pronounced in patients with severely reduced LVEF (≤ 20%) or acute myocardial infarction. There were no increased risks of hyperkalaemia or worsening renal function after 24 h of management, albeit with a risk of hypotension. In this prospective, multicentre, nationwide, propensity score-matched study of patients with a broad spectrum of CS aetiologies, early MRA use was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day all-cause mortality. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm its benefit and clarify its role in therapeutic management.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac involvement has been described in many forms of vasculitides and is associated with worse outcomes. However, data on the incidence of structural and arrhythmic heart disease is limited. For this single-center study, we recruited 191 patients with giant-cell arteritis (GCA, n = 109), Takayasu arteritis (TAK, n = 26), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, n = 3), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, n = 38), or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, n = 15) between August 2023 and January 2025. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of structural or arrhythmic heart disease after the diagnosis of vasculitis. The demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with vasculitis differed significantly between those with GCA, TAK, PAN, GPA, and EGPA. Arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia at baseline were more prevalent among patients with GCA, while chest pain and signs of congestion were more frequently reported by patients with EGPA. No significant difference between the five main subgroups were found regarding the incidence of documented arrhythmic diseases. Cardiac imaging was performed using echocardiography in 70% of the overall cohort and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in 11%. CMR detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis in 33% and 40% of EGPA patients, respectively. All four cases of acute myocardial infarction occurred in patients with GCA. Among 19 GCA patients who underwent coronary angiography, 21.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. In the EGPA group, coronary angiography was performed in 46.7% of patients, but none required percutaneous intervention. A substantial proportion of patients was treated with acetylsalicylic acid (50.3%), beta-blockers (41.9%), or ACE-inhibitors/AT1-receptor antagonists (60.2%). Severe cardiac complications occurred rarely, although cardiovascular risk factors, structural abnormalities, and arrhythmias affected a substantial proportion of patients with vasculitis, highlighting the potential benefit of systematic screening and multidisciplinary management.",

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains one of the most critical challenges in emergency cardiology, associated with high mortality rates. Early recognition and prevention of its progression are pivotal, as preventing shock not only improves prognosis but also significantly reduces treatment costs compared with managing established shock. Stage A of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions classification demonstrates substantial clinical and prognostic heterogeneity in real-world practice. The criteria for stage A remain ambiguous: studies vary in defining \"extensive myocardial infarction,\" overlook the impact of infarct localization, and fail to account for microvascular dysfunction and systemic inflammation in disease progression. This results in the inclusion of patients with diametrically opposed risks-from minimal to critical-limiting opportunities for preventive intervention. A key issue is the lack of specific biomarkers to identify patients at genuine risk of shock progression. Emerging evidence highlights the underappreciated roles of microcirculatory disturbances and inflammatory responses. Integrating imaging techniques and inflammatory biomarkers into CS diagnostic algorithms, as supported by recent studies, represents a promising direction. Dynamic reassessment of patient status, including continuous monitoring of lactate, hemodynamics, and organ perfusion markers, is another critical aspect. Early application of mechanical circulatory support in stages A-B reduces mortality but requires precise identification of the target population. Only a multidisciplinary approach incorporating dynamic risk stratification and precision methods can minimize inappropriate use of aggressive therapies or ensure their timely application, thereby improving outcomes in patients at risk of CS.",

Using the TriNetX U.S. Collaborative Network, we identified 1440 matched patients (720 SGLT2i+ vs 720 SGLT2i-) with preserved ejection fraction and no prior heart failure. Nearly 90% of patients had diabetes. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of MI, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. At 1 year, MACE occurred in 17.4% of SGLT2i+ versus 22.0% of SGLT2i- patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.746, 95% CI 0.574-0.969; P = .028), and all-cause mortality occurred in 3.1% versus 7.6%, respectively (OR 0.389, 95% CI 0.234-0.645; P < .001). SGLT2i use was also associated with lower risks of major bleeding. Findings were consistent over long-term follow-up. While the observed associations suggest potential cardioprotective effects of SGLT2i post-MI in patients without heart failure, residual confounding cannot be excluded.

The cohort included 239 current and former smokers who underwent colorectal surgery from 2012 to 2022. The primary endpoint was major adverse events 30-days postoperatively, defined as incidence of major bleeding, venous-thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, infection, mortality, or readmission.ResultsThe most common procedure was colon resection.

Epidemiological observations and molecular studies collectively suggest an underrecognized interplay between AA and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship between them remains controversial and requires further investigation. To evaluate the association between AA and CVD through a meta-analysis of combinable results. We systematically searched four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) for relevant studies from inception to December 6, 2024. Studies included in the analysis were cohort or case-control studies that focused on the relationship between AA and CVD. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our search yielded five studies involving 238,270 AA patients from three countries. The meta-analysis revealed that AA patients had an increased OR (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.92; p < 0.01) for CVD outcomes compared to the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed a stronger risk in patients with alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis (OR = 3.80; 95% CI: 1.65 to 8.73; p < 0.01). Associations were not observed between patch-type AA and CVD, nor between AA and ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. This meta-analysis suggests that AA patients, especially those with alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, may have an elevated risk of developing CVD. Given the shared immunological mechanisms, systemic inflammation in AA may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk.

    "abstract": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infectious cardiac condition characterized by therapeutic complexity and high mortality rates, for which precise pathogen identification is critical to guide accurate treatment. Although this disease is frequently caused by commensal microorganisms of the oral flora, including Streptococcus cristatus (S. cristatus); however, S. cristatus is not a common pathogen associated with IE. A 59-year-old male patient was admitted to our intensive care unit due to chest tightness and shortness of breath persisting for 10 days, with symptoms worsening over the last 6 h, including dyspnea and an inability to lie down. After the patient was admitted to the hospital for comprehensive examinations, a preliminary clinical diagnosis of IE, aortic valve vegetation formation, acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and heart failure was established. The patient had negative preoperative blood culture results and received empiric therapy with moxifloxacin combined with piperacillin-tazobactam for infection control, subsequently undergoing cardiac surgery. Intraoperatively obtained valve vegetations were sent for pathological testing, tissue bacterial culture, and capture-based mNGS (metagenomic next-generation sequencing) testing. The capture-based mNGS results for the vegetation was returned as S. cristatus within 24 h, with 250,119 sequences detected and 54.56% coverage, which facilitated the rapid identification of the pathogenic microorganism of IE in the early stage. The tissue culture result of the vegetation was returned on the 5th day of delivery, confirming the presence of S. cristatus. The patient was successfully discharged after comprehensive treatment and returned to the hospital 3 weeks post-discharge for a follow-up examination, which suggested a good recovery. This case highlights a rare instance of S. cristatus endocarditis, which was ultimately confirmed at an early stage through capture-based mNGS performed on valvular vegetation. This suggests that for postoperative patients with persistent infection and blood culture-negative IE, valvular capture-based mNGS serves as a rapid and efficient diagnostic tool to expedite pathogen identification and guide targeted antimicrobial therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, with heart failure (HF) significantly contributing to this burden. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular conditions, including HF. This narrative review examines the relationship between CRP levels and the risk of incident HF in patients with pre-existing CVD. By synthesizing findings from prospective cohort studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses, we aim to assess the potential role of CRP as a predictive biomarker for HF onset. Inflammation is a critical component in HF pathophysiology, contributing to myocardial remodeling, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) assays allow for the detection of low-grade inflammation, offering improved risk stratification for cardiovascular events. Studies indicate that elevated hs-CRP levels correlate with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and HF development. However, CRP's specificity as a marker remains a challenge due to its association with various systemic inflammatory conditions. Recent research has explored CRP's role in HF subtypes, particularly HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Despite growing evidence linking CRP to HF, gaps remain in understanding its mechanistic role, optimal clinical thresholds, and therapeutic implications. Future research should focus on mechanistic studies elucidating CRP's direct impact on myocardial dysfunction, subgroup-specific analyses, and interventional trials targeting CRP-driven inflammation. Addressing these gaps could significantly improve HF prevention and management by leveraging CRP as a viable prognostic and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The concurrent management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) poses a significant clinical challenge due to conflicting treatment goals. While the management of STEMI requires coronary reperfusion with antithrombotic agents (anticoagulants and antiplatelets), such treatments are contraindicated in cases of ICH. The coexistence of STEMI and ICH is exceedingly rare in the literature and is associated with high mortality rates. Furthermore, no specific guidelines currently exist for managing such cases. We report a case of a 67-year-old male presenting with acute ICH who subsequently developed inferior STEMI complicated by third-degree atrioventricular block. The patient underwent a deferred percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy, involving only balloon angioplasty and thrombectomy without stent placement, to restore coronary flow while minimizing the risk of exacerbating the intracranial haemorrhage. Three days later, ischaemia progressed to recurrent myocardial infarction, at which point reassessment revealed stabilization of the ICH, allowing for stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) and the administration of antithrombotic therapy. The deferred PCI strategy, involving initial thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty without stent placement, facilitated temporary restoration of coronary flow and provided a critical time window for the stabilization of the ICH. This approach enabled subsequent stent implantation and the reintroduction of antithrombotic therapy (anticoagulants and antiplatelets). This strategy demonstrates its effectiveness in managing patients with concurrent STEMI and ICH by balancing the risks of ischaemia and haemorrhage, thereby improving clinical outcomes.",

It is central to the management of coronary heart disease. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of PCI across the African continent, and this review aims to evaluate and report the clinical outcomes of PCI use in Africa among patients with coronary heart disease. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, and AJOL (African Journals Online) from inception to February 2025. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was used in this study. Three hundred two articles underwent full screening following predefined eligibility criteria, and 31 articles were included for qualitative analysis. The primary outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included post-procedural outcomes like complications and post-procedure thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade. This review synthesized 31 articles from nine African countries. A total of 11,507 patients participated in this study, and 10,701 patients underwent PCI procedures, with stenting being the most common technique employed. Among participants, 8,620 (74.3%) are male, and 2,887 (24.8%) are female. A total of 170 (17.8%) cases of MACE were reported, and an overall mortality of 457 (4.9%) was reported. In-hospital mortality accounted for 317 of the total mortality, making up 4.7% of the assessed patients. About 78.2% of patients who underwent PCI achieved post-procedure TIMI flow grade III, an indicator of post-procedure reperfusion success rate in the study. The most common complications reported include: Heart failure (19.1%), arrhythmia (9.1%), revascularization (8.9%), coronary events (8.1%), structural complications (8.1%), and the need for intensive care unit support (7.9%). An allergic reaction (4.7%), a rare complication, was also reported. The study shows that mortality rates are relatively higher when compared to higher-resource countries. STEMI remains the predominant indication for PCI, underscoring a healthcare system that is still largely reactive rather than preventive. The high burden of comorbidities such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, paired with complication rates including heart failure and MACE, reflects systemic gaps in both acute and chronic cardiovascular care. To improve outcomes and close the equity gap, African health systems must prioritize context-sensitive guideline implementation, capacity building, and continuity of care.",

Among 278,995 HCM hospitalizations (mean age 64.3 ± 18.4 years; 55.7% female), in-hospital mortality rose from 16.4% to 22.9% throughout the study. Cardiac arrest (41.00%), tamponade (13.70%), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (10.20%) had the highest mortality rates. Atrial fibrillation (AF) (42.10%), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (28.10%), and cardiorenal syndrome (16.60%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. Predictors of case-fatality included increasing age (aOR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03, p < 0.0001), Asian/Pacific Islander race (aOR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10-2.40, p = 0.007), CVA (aOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.70-3.06, p < 0.0001), NSTEMI (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.30-2.40, p < 0.0001), cardiorenal syndrome (aOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20-1.80, p < 0.001), and cardiac arrest (aOR: 26.60, 95% CI: 20.90-33.90, p < 0.001). Mortality rate among hospitalized HCM patients has shown a mild upward trend and is driven by age, race, NSTEMI, and cardiorenal syndrome. Our study reveals that individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which is a lifelong heart condition who are older, belong to certain racial groups, or have additional health issues like stroke, heart attack, or kidney problems are more likely to die during hospitalization, with cardiac arrest being the most serious complication, which underscores the importance of early identification of high-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment plans to enhance survival and to support this goal, future research should track patients over time and include detailed information from imaging, genetics, and treatment records, while also assessing tailored care strategies, such as managing accompanying health conditions and referring patients to specialized centers that offer integrated care.",

    "abstract": "Adult zebrafish and neonatal mice can fully regenerate their hearts after partial amputation through proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, the adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capability following cardiac damage. The reason for this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we find that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is accumulated only in the injury hearts of zebrafish and neonatal mice, but not of adult mice, which coincides with the upregulation of DHA synthesis genes in CMs, fibrobasts and macrophages near the injury areas. Inhibition of Fads2, a DHA synthesis enzyme, impairs heart regeneration in both zebrafish and neonatal mice. Injection of DHA remodels transcriptome from injury response to regeneration response and improves cardiac function in adult mice after myocardial infarction. Interestingly, DHA facilitates CM proliferation, but inhibits fibrosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, only DHA, but not oleic acid (OA), can trigger the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor d (PPARD) to bind to the promoter regions of heart regeneration related genes such as: Mef2d, Phlda3 and Txndc5 to regulate their expression. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis experiments suggest that DHA binds to PPARD in a distinct manner compared to OA, which may help explain their differing abilities to influence the expression of heart regeneration genes. Our findings demonstrate that the DHA signal plays an essential and evolutionarily conserved role in heart regeneration and provide a therapeutic potential for myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "To date, the best side branch (SB) protection strategy in patients with coronary bifurcation lesions (CBLs)-related ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has not yet been settled. This study sought to evaluate the clinical outcome of the jailed balloon (JBT) and jailed wire techniques (JWT) for the SB protection strategy in STEMI patients with culprit CBLs. This large-scale multicenter (n = 10) observational retrospective study included STEMI patients with culprit CBLs who underwent PCI with provisional stenting. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as the combination of death from cardiac causes, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Propensity score-matching analysis was performed. A total of 1218 consecutive patients (male: 1020 [83.7%], mean age: 57.68 ± 11.76 years) were included in this study. The study cohort was divided into two groups as JBT (n = 196) and JWT (n = 1022). The incidences of the SB intervention (21.4% vs. 36.2%, p < 0.001) and residual stenosis of SB ≥ 70% (23.0% vs. 45.5%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the JBT group compared to the JWT group. Whereas procedure time (47.21 ± 17.70 vs. 40.94 ± 13.18 min, p < 0.001) and fluoroscopy time (15.92 ± 9.51 vs. 13.39 ± 6.69 min, p = 0.001) were notably higher in the JBT group than in the JWT group. The risk-adjusted midterm MACE (HR: 0.688, p = 0.200) and clinally driven TLR (HR: 0.566, p = 0.170) did not differ in individuals with culprit CBLs to protect the SB with JBT and the JWT in the propensity-matched cohort. The present study suggests that risk-adjusted MACE and TLR rates were comparable between both techniques at midterm follow-up.",

It is currently acknowledged as a fundamental therapeutic objective that clinicians must address from the acute event to the comprehensive clinical follow-up.

Inclusion criteria: anterior V1-V4 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >50%. other STEMI locations, heart disorders, systemic diseases. Patients underwent pharmacological or percutaneous revascularization. Echocardiography was performed until day 3 of AMI and after 14 days. To measure the length of the expansion segment (LES), an original mathematical formula was obtained using the parasternal short-axis view at the papillary muscle level, myocardial mass (MM), and interventricular septum thickness (IST). Statistical studies have used the Student's t-test, the linear regression equations and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. 172 AMI patients were analyzed and divided into two groups. Patients with LVH showed a strong reverse Pearson's correlation coefficient between LES and IST. For group II, a significant strongly reverse correlation for the LES and IST. Pre-existing LVH in AMI is associated with the limitation of the expansion. In the group without LVH, a 1 cm increase in LES corresponds to a 0.0622 cm decrease in IST.",

Some patients may require intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or percutaneous ventricular assist device (PVAD) placement; however, there is a paucity of standardised algorithms to guide the deployment of each device. The present study evaluated interhospital variation in the use of IABP and PVAD for AMI CS and identified institutional factors associated with hospital-level device preference. All non-elective adult hospitalisations entailing AMI and CS were identified within the 2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patients were grouped into IABP, PVAD and non-mechanical circulatory support cohorts. The primary aim was to quantify the degree of interhospital variation in the use of IABP and PVAD. Escalation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, length of stay and hospitalisation costs were secondarily assessed. Hospital factors, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume and safety net status, were also analysed. Among 53 903 patients, 23.4% received IABP, and 12.5% received PVAD. After adjustment for patient factors, approximately 13% (11-14%) of variation in IABP use and 18% (15-20%) of PVAD use were attributable to centre-level differences. High-PVAD hospitals had higher annual PCI volume (257 (185-369) vs 204 (148-276) cases/year, p=0.032) and were more commonly safety net institutions (27.4% vs 11.3%, p=0.023), compared to high-IABP hospitals. Patients treated at high-IABP and high-PVAD hospitals faced similar length of stay (β -0.16, 95% CI -1.82 to 1.49) and costs (β -$3500, 95% CI -16 600 to 9600). Those at high-PVAD hospitals had lower adjusted risk of escalation to ECMO (0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.95) and LVAD implantation (0.28, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.94). The present study identified wide interhospital variation in the use of IABP and PVAD for AMI CS. Although the likelihood of escalation to ECMO or LVAD differed between hospital types, resource utilisation was similar.",

    "abstract": "The most frequent complications of open thoracoabdominal aortic repair are respiratory in nature. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative diaphragm management on prolonged postoperative ventilation, pulmonary complications, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic repair. Retrospective single-institutional review of patients who underwent extent I-V open thoracoabdominal aortic repair between 2013 and 2024. Patients who did not require diaphragm division were excluded. Outcomes were analyzed in two groups based on complete or partial diaphragm division. The primary outcome was prolonged ventilation, defined as postoperative ventilator support >48 hours. Secondary outcomes included early respiratory morbidity, in-hospital mortality, major adverse events, intensive care unit and hospital stay. Univariate followed by multivariable analysis was used to evaluate the association of extent of diaphragm division with the primary and secondary outcomes. Among 135 patients who underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic repair during the study period, 110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Average age was 54 ±14 years, and 77 patients (70%) were male. Most repairs were done for post-dissection aneurysms (n=83, 76%) requiring extent II thoracoabdominal aortic repair (n=88, 80%). Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative variables were similar between the two groups. Full circumferential diaphragm division was performed in 60 patients (54%), while 50 patients (46%) had partial division. Prolonged ventilation occurred in twenty-five patients (24%). On univariate analysis, patients who underwent full circumferential diaphragm division were more likely to have prolonged ventilation as compared to those who had partial division (32%, n=18 vs 15%, n=7, p=0.037). This association persisted on multivariable analysis (odds ratio; 4.0, CI; 1.4-11.8, p=0.01). Patients who had full circumferential diaphragm division demonstrated a trend towards higher rate of postoperative pneumonia (35% vs 25%), need for re-intubation (16% vs 8%), and intensive care unit readmission (20% vs 10%). No significant difference was seen when comparing in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit and hospital stay, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and renal failure requiring dialysis. Partial division of the diaphragm is associated with shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation but without any significant impact on mortality or major adverse events. Partial diaphragm division should be considered in open thoracoabdominal aortic repair repairs.",

Post-MI pathology can activate a diverse type of programmed cell death (PCD), which aggravates cardiac dysfunction and causes post-ischemic heart failure. Although various PCD inhibitors have shown potential efficacy against several cardiac complications, their roles in preventing or reducing myocardial loss and dysfunction in post-MI pathology have never been clarified. A rat model of MI was used in this study and post-MI rats were randomly assigned into 5 subgroups (n = 7/group): (1) vehicle (3%V/V DMSO), (2) enalapril (10 mg/kg), (3) zVAD-FMK (1 mg/kg), (4) Necrostatin-1 (1.65 mg/kg), or (5) Ferrostatin-1 (2 mg/kg). All treatments were given for 32 days via intraperitoneal injection. A control group of sham-operated rats underwent thoracotomy without left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion (n = 7). After 32 days of treatment, echocardiography and ventricular pressure-volume (P-V) loop studies, mitochondrial function, histopathological studies, and molecular analysis were carried out. Treatment with zVAD-FMK, Necrostatin-1, and Ferrostatin-1 mitigated pathological cardiac remodeling, reduced apoptosis and necroptosis-mediated myocardial injury, alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, and improved cardiac function in post-MI rats. These findings indicated that inhibition of apoptosis and necroptosis could be novel strategies for treatment in post-MI conditions.",

We entered participant-level risk factor values over time into a validated type 2 diabetes-specific clinical outcomes model to estimate event rates, and compared simulated with observed relative risk changes in EXSCEL. We performed simulations for each participant to minimize uncertainty and to optimize confidence interval precision around risk point estimates. Six outcomes were examined: major adverse CV event (MACE), all-cause mortality (ACM), CV death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). We also performed a mediation analysis using Cox regression models to evaluate potential key mediators for ACM. Model simulations explained only modest proportions of the observed relative risk reductions for MACE (29%), ACM (15%), CV death (18%), and stroke (29%), but greater proportions for hHF (67%) and MI (200%). Mediation analysis suggested that baseline-to-6 or 12-month changes in HbA1c, blood pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight did not mediate the EQW effect on ACM. These model simulations explain only a modest proportion of the impact of observed EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors on EXSCEL outcomes, apart from hHF and MI. Up to 1-year changes in conventional risk factors did not mediate the observed ACM risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "The heart is an organ that depends significantly on mitochondria to operate, since it requires a lot of energy, which mitochondria create, making them essential for the efficient functioning of the heart. The term \"mitochondrial dynamics\" refers to extremely dynamic organelles known as mitochondria that undergo cycles of fusion and fission to modify their appearance, distribution, and function. Drp1 or Dynamin-related protein 1, a primary fission protein, strictly regulates the elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. This ensures that the complex processes of organ and cellular dynamics in the heart are strictly managed. Phosphorylation, SUMOylation, palmitoylation, ubiquitination, S-nitrosylation, and O-GlcNAcylation are some of the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of Drp1 that contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. While abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics are a crucial component of the pathophysiology of a number of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the heart requires an effective mitochondrial balance to sustain cardiomyocyte metabolism along with contractile activity. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the crucial function of Drp1 inhibitors in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, dysfunction of endothelial cells, smooth muscle remodelling, hypertrophy of the heart, high blood pressure, and myocardial infarction. We further highlighted the possible advantages of treating CVDs by specifically targeting Drp1.",

Endothelial shear stress (ESS) has recently emerged among the key players determining lesions instability and cardiovascular risk. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of ESS-based quantities and their interplay with anatomical and clinical factors in predicting adverse cardiovascular events in older patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD). This post hoc analysis of the Functional Assessment in Elderly MI Patients with Multivessel Disease (FIRE) trial included older patients (≥75 years) with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and MVD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ESS was assessed by angiography-based computational fluid dynamics simulations and the topological shear variation index (TSVI), recently emerged as predictor of future MI measurable within a clinical framework, was computed in non-culprit coronary lesions with negative functional assessment left untreated. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at one year, defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal MI, stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization. Multivariate Cox regression and causal inference analysis were used to assess the prognostic role of anatomo-functional metrics alongside traditional risk factors. A total of 335 FIRE trial patients were analyzed. The median percentage area stenosis (%AS), lesion length, time-averaged ESS, and TSVI were 57.2 %, 12.3 mm, 2.9 Pa, and 59.2 m-1, respectively. Severe lesions were associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio, HR, 1.024, 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.002-1.046, p = 0.031). Longer lesions were significantly linked to an increased risk of all-cause death (HR 1.042, 95 % CI 1.009-1.077, p = 0.013), while TSVI was associated with higher risk of MI (HR 1.006, 95 % CI 1.000-1.012, p = 0.014) and ischemia-driven revascularization (HR 1.006, 95 % CI 1.000-1.012, p = 0.021). The inclusion of %AS, lesion length, and TSVI significantly improved multivariate outcome prediction. Causal inference analysis indicated that TSVI had a strong causal association with both MI and revascularization, with an information content at least equal to that of %AS. TSVI, rather than absolute ESS magnitude, plays a key role in predicting acute events in older MI patients with MVD. Integrating ESS-based factors with traditional clinical and anatomical factors significantly enhances risk prediction and helps refine management strategies for this challenging patient population.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Hypericin (Hyp) on the hearts of rats with myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and its underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and H9C2 cells underwent MIRI and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) modelling after Hyp administration to assess the compound's effects on cardiac and cardiomyocyte characteristics, as well as mitochondrial energy metabolism. A range of techniques, including 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, haematoxylin-eosin staining, echocardiography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative proteomics analysis, molecular docking, and Western blotting were employed to further characterize Hyp's cardioprotective effects and its influence on related molecular expressions. TUNEL staining and Western blotting were also used to examine the morphological, molecular, and functional phenotypes of H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Hyp significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function in MIRI rats. Hyp increased cardiomyocyte viability while decreasing cardiomyocyte damage. The cardioprotective effects of Hyp were primarily mediated by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, mainly through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) signalling pathway. Hyp regulates the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway to improve mitochondrial energy metabolism and reduce oxidative stress, thereby mitigating MIRI in rats.",

Diabetic individuals are at increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis. A significant percentage of diabetics fail to perceive the typical symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Screening methods such as coronary computed tomography (CCTA) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have not shown clear benefits in asymptomatic diabetics. The role of stress CMR in this population is not well established. Between 2008 and 2018, all consecutive diabetic and non-diabetic patients without known cardiovascular disease referred for stress perfusion CMR in two tertiary centers were included. Propensity-score matching was used to create a cohort of diabetic versus non-diabetic patients with similar baseline characteristics. All patients were followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Diabetic patients were categorized into symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Out of 3,485 eligible patients, 1,359 diabetics and 1,359 non-diabetics (mean age 69±12 years, 57.4% women) with similar propensity scores were included. Over a median follow-up period of 6.5 (5.9-8.9) years, 386 (14.2%) experienced MACEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis for the occurrence of MACE indicated that the extent of ischemia or late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) involving ≥ 3 segments were independent predictors of the occurrence of MACEs (hazard ratio, HR: 7.14 [95% CI, 5.01-10.02]; and HR: 5.03 [95% CI, 3.47-7.29]; both p<0.001, respectively), with no significant differences between diabetics and non-diabetics. Asymptomatic diabetics (n=255) showed similar event rates as symptomatic patients (p=0.98). Stress CMR provides valuable prognostic information in diabetic patients, irrespective of symptoms.

Fifty patients with clinical indication for stress CMR underwent quantitative perfusion imaging in resting conditions, after regadenoson-induced hyperemia (400 mcg, 5 mL), and 10 min after recovery with euphylline. Studies showing hypoperfusion due to ischemia and/or prior myocardial infarction were excluded. Global myocardial blood flow during rest (MBFrest), stress (MBFstress) and recovery (MBFrecovery) and MPR indices (MPRstress/rest and MPRstress/recovery) were calculated using automated pixel-wise quantitative myocardial perfusion mapping. A total of 30 patients (22 males, mean age of 62.7 ± 1 years) were included in the analysis. Global MBFrest and MBFstress were 0.83 ± 0.2 mL/g/min and 2.1 ± 0.6 mL/g/min, respectively. After recovery with euphylline, myocardial perfusion did not return to the resting values (MBFrecovery of 0.92 ± 0.3 mL/g/min) and statistically differed from MBFrest (p < 0.01), suggesting residual myocardial hyperemia. This resulted in an abnormally low MPRstress/recovery (2.43 ± 0.7) with respect to MPRstress/rest (2.56 ± 0.7) (p = 0.03). A linear mixed-effects model accounting for repeated measures revealed statistically significant group differences over time in global MBF (mean difference 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.17, p = 0.01) and global MPR (mean difference -0.13, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.02, p = 0.02). Despite the use of euphylline to counteract the vasodilator effect, MBF does not completely revert to resting values and MBFrecovery cannot be used as a substitute for MBFrest when regadenoson is used. Consequently, a rest/stress protocol is advised for quantitative CMR perfusion to obtain accurate MBF and MPR parameters.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To study the prognostic value of biomarkers in patients with heart failure of ischemic origin with concomitant atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. Material and Methods: 398 patients with heart failure (HF) on the background of post-infarction cardiosclerosis (198 women and 200 men) were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the HF phenotype: Group I - 167 (42.0%) patients who had reduced LV EF (≤ 40%); II group - 133 (33.4%) patients with moderately reduced LV EF (41-49%); Group III - 98 (24.6%) patients with preserved LV EF (≥ 50%). Results: In HF patients with reduced LVEF, compared to patients who had moderately reduced and preserved FE, IV FK according to NYHA and AF are more often diagnosed 70.1%, against 53.4% and 38.8%; c2 = 25.57, p = 0.0001); higher one-year mortality (12.0%, against 1.5% and 4.1%), approximately the same frequency of RH; higher levels of NT-proBNP (by 16.2%, at p = 0.015) and ST-2 (43.0 [38.3 - 47.3] ng/ml, against 41.0 [35.8 - 44.6 ] ng/ml and 41.2 [37.0 - 44.6] ng/ml, with p = 0.004). The NT-proBNP / BNP ratio > 10.17 AU had a higher prognostic value compared to NT-proBNP for PG. Conclusions: In patients with heart failure of ischemic genesis with concomitant atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus, the NT-proBNP /ST-2 ratio >17.12 AU has the greatest prognostic value (Se=85.1%; Sp=80.0%). The frequency of RH in this group reaches 97.6% during the year.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gout are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Despite the approval for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2023, evidence regarding the effectiveness of colchicine among T2DM population remains limited. We aimed to evaluate the association between the use of colchicine and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with gout and T2DM. We conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study with active comparator, new-user design using nationwide claims data of South Korea (2010-2022). Patients with T2DM and gout who initiated colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from 2011 to 2022 were included. The primary outcome was MACE (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death). Secondary outcomes were each individual components of primary outcome and hospitalization due to heart failure. As-treated approach with 30-day grace period was applied. Before propensity score (PS) matching, 13,019 colchicine users and 111,594 NSAIDs users were included in the study cohort (mean age, 65.5 vs. 62.9; 35.0% vs. 29.8% female). After 1:2 PS matching, 12,908 colchicine users and 25,816 NSAIDs users remained (mean age, 65.7 vs. 65.7 years; 35.2% vs. 35.1% female). The PS-matched hazard ratio for MACE was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.65-1.36), and all secondary outcomes also resulted in null findings. Use of colchicine does not significantly reduce the risk of MACE compared with NSAIDs in a real-world population with T2DM and gout in South Korea between 2011 and 2022.",

We aimed to test the utility of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention shock staging system recently refined by the CS Working Group in an Asian population and to investigate its association with in-hospital adverse events. From the Japanese nationwide registry of Impella, the patients with CS who successfully received Impella support between February 2020 and December 2023 were included and assigned to any stage according to the CS Working Group-refined Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention staging system. We set the primary end point as in-hospital death and explored it within each stage, with stage B as a reference. In total, 4643 patients were analyzed (median age, 69 years; women, 23.3%; CS due to acute myocardial infarction, 61.7%), and 122, 588, 1905, and 2058 patients were in stages B, C, D, and E, respectively. After adjustment with potential confounders, stage C had no significant difference in in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.69-1.80]; P=0.653). However, with adjusted analysis, stages D and E had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital death (stage D: odds ratio, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.55-3.77]; P<0.001; stage E: odds ratio, 4.90 [95% CI, 3.14-7.66]; P<0.001). The CS Working Group-refined Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention staging system at baseline has a satisfactory association with in-hospital death in the more progressive stage; however, the system seems to have a lower power in the earlier phase of CS. Further investigation is warranted to establish a more accurate staging system.",

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a critical condition associated with high mortality rates, making prompt diagnosis essential for timely interventions that may improve patient outcomes. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) SHOCK Stage Classification is a validated tool for assessing CS and predicting patient outcomes. Here, we evaluated how different parameter definitions affect SCAI stage adjudication, hypothesizing that variations may influence stage determination and the overall assessment of CS. All patients diagnosed with CS or conditions leading to CS at the University Medical Center Mannheim, Germany, from January 2018 to June 2022 were included in the study. SCAI SHOCK stages were assigned retrospectively on the basis of 4 previously published studies. The distribution of SCAI SHOCK stages, outcomes, classification concordance, and predictive performance were assessed. From January 2018 to June 2022, we identified 1303 patients on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Of these, 1281 patients (98.2%) were classified into SCAI SHOCK stages according to all 4 classification frameworks. While the assignment of SCAI SHOCK stages and associated mortality rates varied among the frameworks, Kendall's W indicated moderate to strong overall classification agreement (W=0.70). There was no significant difference in predictive performance for in-hospital death. Our study demonstrates a moderate to strong concordance and comparable prognostic performance across different SCAI SHOCK Stage Classification frameworks in evaluating patients with CS. Despite differences in stage assignments, all frameworks effectively stratified patients by clinical severity. Comparable stage assignment in retrospective studies requires further standardization of the SCAI SHOCK Stage Classification system.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based model to predict the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain, for whom acute myocardial infarction was excluded after serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing. This retrospective analysis included adult patients presenting with chest pain at 5 study hospitals between 2021 and 2024 in Texas. Patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction during the index visit were excluded. The primary outcome was the occurrence of 30-day MACE, defined as myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality within 30 days of the index ED visit. A long short-term memory algorithm was used to develop the prediction model. The analysis included 14 177 patients with a median age of 49.7 years, 41.2% of whom were men. A total of 535 patients (3.8%) had at least 1 high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level above the 99th percentile. Thirty-nine patients (0.3%) experienced 30-day MACE, including 15 (0.1%) with myocardial infarction and 24 (0.2%) with all-cause mortality. The long short-term memory model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting 30-day MACE (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.884 [95% CI, 0.815-0.941]), myocardial infarction (AUC, 0.963 [95% CI, 0.926-0.993]), and all-cause mortality (AUC, 0.849 [95% CI, 0.698-0.948]). The long short-term memory model accurately predicted 30-day MACE in ED patients presenting with chest pain and no acute myocardial infarction, using patient demographics, vital signs at ED presentation, electrocardiographic findings, and serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels measured at flexible time points within 24 hours of ED arrival.",

However, subsequent studies have failed to replicate the reported benefits of ticagrelor, raising concerns about the validity of the PLATO trial's findings. Randomized trials published until January 2025 were searched on PubMed and Embase and included if they compared 2 of the 3 standard dual antiplatelet therapies: 12 months aspirin plus clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor. We constructed a network with and without PLATO to assess its impact on the synthesized risk estimates on major adverse cardiovascular events, patient mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, as well as major bleeding and major or minor bleeding. Twelve trials, enrolling 52 415 patients (clopidogrel: 23 557; ticagrelor: 13 344, prasugrel: 15 514) were included. The analysis with PLATO showed lower hazard ratios for ticagrelor versus clopidogrel than the analysis without PLATO in major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, myocardial infarction, and bleeding outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular mortality; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.96] when PLATO was included; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.73-1.25] when PLATO was excluded). Ticagrelor and prasugrel were associated with higher incidences of major bleeding and major or minor bleeding for analyses including and excluding PLATO, altohugh the point estimates for ticagrelor were lower when PLATO was included. The pooled estimates with PLATO favored ticagrelor compared with estimates without PLATO in several studied outcomes, potentially suggesting the substantial impacts of PLATO's findings on the pooled risk estimates; therefore, additional evidence may be needed given the large number of patients worldwide treated with dual antiplatelet therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis, a condition characterized by the deposition of excess collagen in the cardiac tissue, is a major complication of various cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, hypertension, and different types of cardiomyopathies. CAR T-cell therapy, a form of immunotherapy that involves the genetic modification of T cells to recognize and target specific antigens, has shown promise in the treatment of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. The rationale behind using CAR T-cell therapy to treat cardiac fibrosis lies in the fact that fibrosis is often driven by the activation of pro-fibrotic immune cells, such as myofibroblasts. By targeting these pro-fibrotic cells with CAR T-cells, it may be possible to reduce the severity of cardiac fibrosis. Enhancing CAR T-cell therapy through innovative nanoparticle delivery systems provides a comprehensive approach to treating cardiac fibrosis, with experimental evidence indicating potential in reducing fibrosis and improving cardiac function. Despite these benefits, significant challenges such as cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular complications remain. Therefore, this review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac fibrosis and the effects of CAR T-cell therapy on the heart, elucidating both its antifibrotic properties and associated cardiotoxic effects based on findings from recent studies.

The study included serum samples from 150 participants, including 50 AMI patients, 50 HF patients, and 50 healthy individuals. Oxidative stress, trace elements (Cu and Zn), and thiol levels were investigated by automated kits in AMI and HF patients compared to the control group. T-thiol, N-thiol and Cu levels were higher in the AMI group than in the control group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). Cu and Zn levels were higher in the HF group compared to the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). Compared to the HF group, T-thiol (p < 0.05), N-thiol (p < 0.05), and Zn (p < 0.001) levels were higher in the AMI group. By ROC analysis, Zn, Cu and thiol levels showed moderate discriminative power, emphasizing their candidacy as biomarkers. Despite the limitations of age-related variations and sample size, this study pioneers the comparative analysis of AMI and HF, contributing to the elucidation of the complex connections between Zn, Cu and thiol levels in cardiovascular pathologies.

This long-term prospective study examines stroke incidence and stroke-related mortality in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, identifying risk factors and geographic disparities. We enrolled 535 ACS patients admitted to hospitals across three provinces in the Veneto region of Italy. Patients' residences were classified into three urban and three rural areas in each province. Patients were followed prospectively for 24 years or until death. Survival analysis was conducted using uni- and Multivariable Cox regression models. All patients, except for three, completed the follow-up, totaling 6.151 person-years. During follow-up, 84 patients experienced a stroke, with 85% being ischemic and 15% hemorrhagic, proving fatal in 43 cases. The stroke incidence rate was 14/1.000 person-years. Older age (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.30-2.60), atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 2.64; 95% CI 1.49-4.67), and a higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) tertile (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.83) were independent predictors of overall stroke risk, while higher estimated glomerular filtration rate tertile (eGFR) (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53-0.95) was independent predictor a lower risk. A sub-analysis revealed older age (HR 2.67; 95% CI 1.60-4.45) and AF (HR 2.95; 95% CI 1.38-6.32) as independent predictors of fatal stroke. Unexpectedly, we observed a higher fatal stroke risk in urban areas (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.03-3.48) and southern provinces (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.15-2.53). This long-term cohort study reinforces the role of established clinical predictors (age, AF, renal function) in post-ACS stroke risk and highlights novel geographic disparities in fatal stroke outcomes.

    "abstract": "Obesity is becoming a hot topic for people and governments around the world, with many countries even considering it an epidemic. A group of researchers has made new findings about the link between obesity and oral health, making the issue even more sensitive than before. According to the findings, clear signs of periodontal disease are seen in people with a body mass index (BMI) above 30. Also, xerostomia is actually a subset of oral health that can significantly affect various aspects of oral health. Saliva plays an important role in maintaining oral health by keeping your mouth moist, cleaning your teeth, and fighting bacteria. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between obesity indicators, general oral health variables, and xerostomia. This cross-sectional study involved 439 adults aged 50 years or older. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of five sections: (I) demographic information, (II) oral health (issues such as loose teeth, tooth loss, use of dentures/implants, bleeding gums - self based on reported questionnaires and dental examination), (III) general health, (IV) overweight and/or obesity ( based on BMI- Height and weight measurement by a final year dental student), and (V) xerostomia (self-reported questionnaires). Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 24 software, with methods including T-test, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA, Chi-Square test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and logistic regression. A significance level of P < 0.05 was set for analyzing relationships. The study included 312 female and 127 male participants. The average age, body mass index (BMI kg/m2) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR- cm/cm) of the group were 67.8 ± 11.5 years, 24.4 ± 2.1 kg/m², and 0.54 ± 0.4, respectively. The mean of the xerostomia questionnaire XI was 33.21 ± 6.56. Regarding xerostomia (self-reported questionnaires), 21.8% of respondents reported mild symptoms, 11.4% moderate symptoms, and 6.4% severe symptoms. The prevalence of xerostomia was highest in the age group of 80 years or older. People with tooth mobility reported more xerostomia than patients without tooth mobility. 41.5% vs. 27.2% (P = 0.01). Xerostomia was reported statistically significantly more frequently in patients with hypertension (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.04), and myocardial infarction (P = 0.01). Patients who reported good general health had significantly less xerostomia than patients with bad general health (P = 0.04). In this study, BMI and WHtR had no significant relationship with xerostomia (P = 0.61, 0.24, respectively). However, a statistically significant association was found between WHtR and BMI with the number of missing teeth, i.e., the higher the tooth loss, the lower the BMI and WHtR (P = 0.01). The study concludes that the prevalence of xerostomia is 39.6%, as reported by participants. Age emerged as a critical factor influencing this condition, while BMI and WHtR showed no direct relationship with xerostomia itself but were significantly related to tooth loss patterns. Notably, the highest prevalence of xerostomia was observed in patients with pulmonary disease (Asthma and respiratory allergies, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).",

However, residual ventricular septal defect was detected, likely because of patch dehiscence, along with an additional serpiginous septal defect. After discussion within the heart team, a decision was made to proceed with percutaneous closure of the defect using an Amplatzer vascular plug II (Abbott), achieving an excellent clinical outcome.

The incidences of MACE (18.1 vs. 9.5%, p<0.001), TVMI (9.2 vs. 4.7%, p=0.003), and clinically driven TLR (10.7 vs. 4.2%, p<0.001) were notably higher in the AOS group compared to the COS group. Treatment (AOS) (HR:2.469, p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (HR:1.832, p=0.003), reduced LVEF (HR:1.016, p=0.042), SYNTAX score (HR:1.089, p<0.001), lack of intravascular imaging (HR: 1.451, p=0.049), direct stenting (HR:2.171, p=0.001), stent length (HR:1.036, p=0.001) were found to be independent predictors of MACE. In conclusion, this non-randomized study suggests that COS was associated with better long-term MACE, TVMI, and clinically driven TLR rates compared with AOS in patients with ostial LAD disease.",

    "title": "Assessing coronary microvascular dysfunction in refractory no-reflow: Insights from dynamic myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and cardiac MRI.",
    "abstract": "Refractory no-reflow correlates with worse outcomes, including larger infarct sizes, impaired ventricular function, and higher mortality rates, despite advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) are implicated in the pathogenesis, potentially exacerbating ischemic injury and limiting myocardial recovery. While pressure-wire-derived indices such as the Index of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR) have been validated against MRI-defined MVO in STEMI populations, their invasive nature and procedural complexity limit broad adoption. In contrast, combining dynamic SPECT and cardiac MRI enables a comprehensive non-invasive functional-structural evaluation of coronary microvascular function in refractory no-reflow. This study is a post hoc analysis of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and safety of intracoronary epinephrine in patients with refractory no-reflow post-PCI (ClinicalTrials.govNCT04573751). We evaluated global coronary flow metrics (RMBF, SMBF, gRFI) derived from SPECT and assessed structural mark-ers of microvascular injury (infarct size, MVO) on MRI. Echocardiographic estimations of LVEDP were also analyzed. Dynamic SPECT revealed suboptimal stress myocardial blood flow in most patients, highlighting microvascular impairment. Elevated estimated LVEDP was significantly cor-related with indexed MVO (rs = 0.678, p = 0.001). Traditional flow reserve metrics showed lim-ited sensitivity, whereas global relative flow increase (gRFI) showed a statistically significant correlation with MVO, highlighting its added value in detecting stress-induced perfusion abnormalities. Given the small sample and potential outlier influence, this observation should be considered hypothesis-generating. Our findings support that functional impairments-particularly elevated LVEDP and reduced gRFI-are associated with refractory no-reflow. In particular, gRFI may serve as a promising non-invasive marker of microvascular dysfunction, complementing structural imaging. None-theless, further validation in larger cohorts is needed. This study advocates for refined multimod-al imaging strategies and tailored therapeutic approaches targeting dynamic microvascular dis-turbances to improve outcomes in refractory no-reflow.",

Contemporary data from large, unselected populations are needed to understand differences between these groups. The Cardiogenic Shock Working Group (CSWG) registry enrolls patients with CS at 36 international sites. We analyzed patients with Impella CP enrolled from 2019-2024, categorized by CS etiology and mechanical support device exposure. Baseline characteristics, complications, and outcomes were compared. Outcomes included survival to discharge, native heart survival, and heart replacement therapy. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and complications. A total of 1486 patients with CS (57.9% AMI-CS, 34.9% HF-CS) and Impella CP were analyzed. Patients with HF-CS were younger (60 vs 64 years; p<0.001) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (26.4% vs 13.6; p<0.001) than those with AMI-CS. Impella CP alone was used in 38.3%, CP+ECMO in 23.1%, and CP+≥2 other devices in 20.4%. Acute kidney injury was more common in HF-CS than AMI-CS (66.5% vs 59.7%, p=0.03) and acute limb ischemia more common in AMI-CS than HF-CS (14.4% vs 11.0%; p=0.05). Survival to discharge was 53.4% and was higher in HF-CS than AMI-CS (59.7% vs 49.8%; p<0.001). Those with ≥2 other devices had the lowest survival (43.8%). Total device number was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, limb ischemia, and bleeding.

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) repair damaged myocardium by secreting biological factors and have shown only modest therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. We recently developed a sorbitol-responsive in situ gelling material (SRG) solution, which increases viscosity by diffusing out pre-added sorbitol upon contact with heart tissue without external stimulation. Here, this study demonstrates that intramyocardial injection of MSC-loaded SRG (MSC/SRG) improves cardiac function and facilitates tissue repair following acute myocardial ischemia in rats, and the underlying mechanisms are elucidated. MSC/SRG is more effective than either MSC or SRG alone in preventing cardiac dysfunction and fibrotic remodeling while stimulating angiogenesis. The optimized SRG consists of 25 mg/mL boronic acid group-bearing polymer, 10 mg/mL polyvinyl alcohol, and 5 mg/mL sorbitol, which prolongs MSC survival and enhances their paracrine function in in vitro and in vivo assays. Sorbitol supplementation increases MSC proliferation, modulates cytokine secretion from MSCs in a concentration-dependent manner, and promotes angiogenesis in vitro. These findings suggest that the sorbitol in SRG supports MSC survival and enhances MSC paracrine activity. The SRG may facilitate the therapeutic potential of MSC and hydrogel-based interventions for myocardial ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress has demonstrated the potential of deep learning models in analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) pathologies. However, this method is intricate, expensive to develop, and designed for specific purposes. Large language models show promise in medical image interpretation, and yet their effectiveness in ECG analysis remains understudied. Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 Omni (GPT-4o), a multimodal artificial intelligence model, capable of processing images and text without task-specific training, may offer an accessible alternative. This study aimed to evaluate GPT-4o's effectiveness in interpreting 12-lead ECGs, assessing classification accuracy, and exploring methods to enhance its performance. A total of 6 common ECG diagnoses were evaluated: normal ECG, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and paced rhythm, with 30 normal ECGs and 10 of each abnormal pattern, totaling 80 cases. Deidentified ECGs were analyzed using OpenAI's GPT-4o. Our study used both zero-shot and few-shot learning methodologies to investigate three main scenarios: (1) ECG image recognition, (2) binary classification of normal versus abnormal ECGs, and (3) multiclass classification into 6 categories. The model excelled in recognizing ECG images, achieving an accuracy of 100%. In the classification of normal or abnormal ECG cases, the few-shot learning approach improved GPT-4o's accuracy by 30% from the baseline, reaching 83% (95% CI 81.8%-84.6%). However, multiclass classification for a specific pathology remained limited, achieving only 41% accuracy. GPT-4o effectively differentiates normal from abnormal ECGs, suggesting its potential as an accessible artificial intelligence-assisted triage tool. Although limited in diagnosing specific cardiac conditions, GPT-4o's capability to interpret ECG images without specialized training highlights its potential for preliminary ECG interpretation in clinical and remote settings.",

A systematic search on the main databases Medline, Web of Science, and Embase until April 21, 2024 was performed. Only randomized trials were eligible for this analysis. As primary endpoint we analyzed major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. As secondary endpoints we investigated the individual primary endpoints as well as the rate of total and severe bleeding events. The analysis was carried out using the odds ratio (OR) as outcome measure. Due to the expected heterogeneity across studies, a random-effects model was fitted to the data. In total, 6 randomized trials comprising 33,508 patients (16,824 on clopidogrel, 16,684 on aspirin) were analyzed. Clopidogrel as compared to aspirin significantly reduced MACE (OR 0.85 [95 %CI 0.77-0.94], p < 0.001, I2 = 26 %). The reduction was driven by a decrease in non-fatal MI (OR 0.73 [95 %CI 0.60-0.90], p = 0.01, I2 = 28 %) and stroke (OR 0.86 [95 %CI 0.74-1.00], p = 0.05, I2 = 8 %), without increasing the rates of total (OR 1.04 [95 %CI 0.83-1.31], p = 0.73, I2 = 72 %) or severe bleeding (OR 0.89 [95 %CI 0.83-1.18], p = 0.43, I2 = 50 %). No effect on all-cause mortality was detectable (OR 0.96 [95 %CI 0.87-1.06], p = 0.41, I2 = 0 %). In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, SAPT with clopidogrel is associated with lower MACE rates as compared to aspirin without increasing the risk of bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Gentianella acuta (G. acuta), a traditional remedy for cardiovascular ailments among the Ewenki people of China, has been reported to contain xanthones as its primary bioactive components. However, the complete chemical composition of G. acuta's total xanthones (TXG) and their therapeutic targets in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain inadequately characterized. This study aims to investigate the chemical composition of TXG and identify its therapeutic targets in AMI, focusing on its role and mechanism in the suppression of pyroptosis-mediated inflammatory myocardial injury. UPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed 29 constituents in TXG, including xanthones, flavonoids, lignans, iridoids, and coumarins. And 7 compounds (including 4 xanthones) in TXG can be absorbed into the blood. Xanthones, which constituted 68.1% of TXG's total content as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were the predominant compounds. Key xanthones identified included swertianolin, norswertianolin, bellidifolin, demethylbellidifolin, and mangiferin. Network pharmacology analysis, supported by qRT-PCR, molecular docking, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experimental validation, revealed that TXG's anti-AMI effects are linked to the modulation of inflammatory responses. Key therapeutic targets identified include TLR4, NF-κB, and NLRP3, along with their associated signaling pathways. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that TXG reduced BRD4 expression, thereby inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling. This inhibition attenuated cardiomyocyte pyroptosis and inflammation, reduced infarct size, and improved functional and pathological outcomes in AMI. This study demonstrates that xanthones, the major constituents of G. acuta, are absorbed into the bloodstream and exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting pyroptosis-mediated cardiac inflammation. The underlying mechanism involves multi-target inhibition of the BRD4/TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, underscoring the potential of G. acuta in AMI treatment.",

We established MI rat model through ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and cardiomyocyte injury model through H2O2 stimulation. The effects of B4 on cardiac function in MI rat model were assessed utilizing echocardiography, histological staining, and western blot. In vitro, CCK-8, flow cytometer, and ELISA were utilized for assessing B4's effects on cardiomyocyte viability, apoptosis, inflammatory response. The network pharmacology was applied for exploring B4's mechanism in MI. In vivo, B4 alleviated myocardial injury, as evidenced by improving cardiac function parameters, reduced collagen synthesis and deposition, preserved cardiac structure, and decreased apoptosis, inflammation response, and oxidative stress. In vitro, B4 enhanced cell viability and inhibited oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation response. Mechanistically, based on molecular docking, B4-HTR2A complex was found to have a good binding activity. Furthermore, B4 reduced HTR2A and p-ERK/ERK protein expression in MI rat model and cardiomyocyte injury model. More importantly, the effects of B4 on cardiomyocyte viability, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation were reversed by HTR2A overexpression. HTR2A knockdown alleviated H2O2-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. B4 protected cardiomyocytes and alleviated cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, which were partly mediated by inhibiting HTR2A/ERK pathway. B4 may be a promising therapeutic drug for MI treatment.",

    "abstract": "High incidence of cardiac rupture in murine myocardial infarction (MI) model leads to a substantial loss before the study end-point. Selecting animal models with varying degrees of injury for different research purposes is crucial for cardiovascular research. Male C57 mice were subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) or permanent occlusion (MI) injury. The incidence of cardiac rupture, degree of myocardial injury, inflammatory responses, left ventricular (LV) remodeling and infarct myocardium healing were examined. Compared to MI mice, early reperfusion (1, 2 and 4h I/R) completely prevented cardiac rupture, while delayed reperfusion (12h and 24h I/R) significantly reduced incidence of cardiac rupture to 5.7% and 8.6%, respectively. In the acute phase, prolonged ischemia increased infarct size, myocyte apoptosis, and both systemic and regional inflammatory responses. These changes correspond to enhanced MMP-9 activity and a weakening of the tensile strength of the infarcted myocardium. Following ischemic insult, early reperfusion was associated with less extent of myocardial injury, inflammatory response and adverse cardiac remodeling, whereas, delayed reperfusion and MI groups exhibited severe myocardial damage and remodeling. Furthermore, both early and delayed reperfusion were associated with increased infiltration of type 2 macrophages and proliferation of endothelial cells during the early healing phase, thereby facilitating healing of the infarct myocardium. Delayed reperfusion resulted in a comparable and substantial degree of cardiac remodeling but with a lower risk of cardiac rupture in comparison with MI model. This feature makes it a feasible model for cardiac ischemia research.",

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and impact of postoperative AKI (PO-AKI) in adults who underwent major abdominal surgeries in 2019 at Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile. The primary focus was on the association between PO-AKI and 2-year mortality, along with other postoperative complications and hospital-related outcomes. A descriptive observational study was conducted with approval from the Local Ethical Committee. Patients aged 18 years and older who underwent major abdominal surgeries were included, excluding those with incomplete records or preoperative renal failure. Data were collected from electronic medical records (TiCares) and included demographics, comorbidities, and surgical details. Postoperative complications, including PO-AKI [defined by kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria or clinical diagnosis], in-hospital myocardial infarction, pulmonary thrombosis, pneumonia, sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and 2 years mortality, were recorded. The primary outcome was 2-year mortality, while secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and hospital stay length. Multivariable analysis was used to explore the relationship between PO-AKI and these outcomes. In 214 patients analyzed, PO-AKI occurred in 13.6% of patients and was associated with advanced age (P = .003), high American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) scores (P = .02, between ASA-PS 1-2 vs 3-higher), and longer surgical durations (mean [standard deviation {SD}] 282.6 [144.3] vs 227.4 [108.5] min; P = .02). Individual preoperative creatinine and baseline renal function did not significantly differ between those with and without PO-AKI (P = .82 and P = .22, respectively). PO-AKI was associated with a relative risk of 1.4 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8] for 2-year mortality and stayed in the hospital twice as long as those without PO-AKI (median (min - max) 14 (2-67) vs 7 (0-53) P < .0001). Multivariate analysis identified PO-AKI (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1 [95% CI, 2.5-6.5]; P = .003) as an independent predictor of 2-year mortality. Overall, 20.1% of the cohort died within 2 years, and 3.7% experienced in-hospital mortality. Additional complications included sepsis (12.6%), pulmonary thromboembolism (3.7%), and pneumonia (2.8%). PO-AKI was found to be an independent predictor of 2-year mortality. These findings highlight postoperative renal function impairment as a key marker of poor long-term prognosis. Acute renal deterioration may reflect systemic damage from surgery and/or increased vulnerability in this population, underscoring the need for targeted preventive strategies and early interventions.",

Autophagy exerts a dual role in cardiac repair, balancing protective and detrimental effects. Crocetin, a carotenoid derived from saffron, exhibits anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties; however, its influence on autophagy-related FMT following MI remains unclear.This study aims to determine whether crocetin mitigates post-MI fibrosis and FMT by modulating autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), while also evaluating its effects on cardiac function, infarct size, and autophagic flux. In vivo: Mice subjected to MI were administered crocetin (25-100 mg/kg). Cardiac function was assessed via echocardiography, and fibrosis was evaluated through Masson's trichrome staining and immunofluorescence analysis for α-SMA/LC3. In vitro: Hypoxic CFs were treated with crocetin or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The effects on autophagic flux (GFP-RFP-LC3), protein expression (Beclin-1, LC3-II/I, P62), and mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1) were analyzed. Crocetin enhanced cardiac function, and reduced infarct size and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, while suppressing α-SMA expression. It promoted autophagic flux (as evidenced by increased LC3-II levels and autolysosome formation) and mitophagy (indicated by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential). Treatment with 3-MA negated the antifibrotic effects of crocetin. Crocetin attenuates post-MI pathological remodeling by enhancing autophagic flux to inhibit FMT, thereby identifying it as a promising candidate for antifibrotic therapy.",

Despite current guidelines suggesting an RHR threshold of 80 bpm for heightened risk and potential therapeutic intervention, evidence supporting this cutoff remains inconclusive. To assess the relationship between RHR and CV risk in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and identify an RHR threshold above which CV risk significantly increases. A post hoc analysis was conducted using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD-BP) trial, which included 4733 participants with DM. Baseline RHR were used to stratify patients into RHR categories. Cox proportional hazards models, including restricted cubic splines and segmented regression, were used to evaluate the relationship between RHR and a composite CV endpoint (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or all-cause death), as well as secondary endpoints (CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke). Higher RHR was associated with increased CV risk, with a nonlinear relationship observed. Segmented regression identified an RHR threshold of 77 (7.4) bpm, above which the risk of CV events increased significantly. Stroke risk was most strongly associated with elevated RHR, while myocardial infarction exhibited a linear relationship with RHR. Our findings suggest that an RHR threshold of approximately 77 bpm may better define increased CV risk in patients with DM compared to the previously proposed 80 bpm cut-off. These results may inform clinical decision-making regarding RHR-lowering interventions in this population.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine the possible role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysregulation in the ischemic electrical remodeling observed in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Human heart tissue was obtained from the border of the infarct and remote zones of patients with ischemic heart disease, and mouse heart tissue was obtained from the peri-infarct zone. NMDAR expression was detected using immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting (WB). Spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) in mice were detected using electrocardiogram backpacks. Electrical remodeling post-MI was detected using patch clamp recordings, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, IF, and WB. Mechanistic studies were performed using bioinformatic analysis, plasmid and small interfering RNA transfection, lentiviral packaging, and site-directed mutagenesis. NMDAR is highly expressed in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI. NMDAR inhibition reduces the occurrence of VAs. Mechanistically, NMDAR activation promotes electrophysiological remodeling, as characterized by decreased Nav1.5, Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 expression in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI and rescues these ion channels dysregulation in mice with MI to varying degrees by NMDAR inhibition. Decreased Nav1.5 expression and inward sodium current density were attenuated by NMDAR inhibition in primary rat cardiomyocytes. Moreover, NMDAR activation upregulates T-Box Transcription Factor 3 (TBX3) post-translationally, further downregulating Nav1.5 transcriptionally. Furthermore, AKT1 is the predominant isoform in the ventricular myocardium upstream of TBX3 and mediates NMDAR-induced TBX3 upregulation in cardiomyocytes. NMDAR activation contributes to MI-induced VAs by regulating the AKT1-TBX3-Nav1.5 axis, providing novel therapeutic strategies for treating ischemic arrhythmias.",

We measured circRNA-79530, miR-214, and Twist levels via RT-qPCR, with Twist protein via Western blotting. ROS levels were quantified using DCFH-DA, and cell viability and injuries were assessed through CCK-8, LDH, SOD, and MDA assays, respectively. Mitochondrial performance was assessed through various methods, including the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 staining, the quantification of ATP levels, and the examination of the protein levels of mitochondrial complexes, as well as the expression of fusion proteins. Our findings indicated that downregulation of circRNA-79530 modulated miR-214 and Twist expression, influencing mitochondrial dynamics and ROS production. Knockdown of circRNA-79530 improved cell viability, reduced oxidative stress and enhanced mitochondrial function. Additionally, overexpression of miR-214 mitigated Twist expression, further supporting the effect of miR-214 in H/R conditions. circRNA-79530 could worsen oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and regulate Twist-mediated mitochondrial damage via sponging miR-214 in H9c2 cells under H/R conditions.",

    "title": "Fatal Cytokine Collision: HLH-AIHA in Advanced AIDS-Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Background and Clinical Significance: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) are both life-threatening hematologic syndromes that rarely present together outside of malignancy. Advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) creates a milieu of profound immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation, predisposing patients to atypical overlaps of these disorders. Case Presentation: A 30-year-old woman with poorly controlled AIDS presented with three weeks of jaundice, fever, and fatigue. Initial labs revealed pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated ferritin level. Direct anti-globulin testing confirmed warm AIHA (IgG+/C3d+) with transient cold agglutinins. Despite intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, and transfusions, she developed hepatosplenomegaly, extreme hyperferritinemia, and sIL-2R > 10,000 pg/mL, meeting HLH-2004 criteria. Bone marrow biopsy excluded malignancy; further work-up revealed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. Dexamethasone plus reduced-dose etoposide transiently reduced soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) but precipitated profound pancytopenia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from CMV/parainfluenza pneumonia, bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She ultimately died of hemorrhagic shock after anticoagulation despite maximal supportive measures. Conclusions: This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of HLH-AIHA overlap in AIDS, where cytopenias and hyperferritinemia mask the underlying cytokine storm. Pathogenesis likely involved IL-6/IFN-γ overproduction, impaired cytotoxic T-cell function, and molecular mimicry. While etoposide remains a cornerstone of HLH therapy, its myelotoxicity proved catastrophic in this immunocompromised host, highlighting the urgent need for cytokine-targeted agents to mitigate treatment-related mortality.",

    "title": "Health-Related Quality-of-Life Measures in Patients with Heart Failure Cardiogenic Shock Following Axillary Mechanical Circulatory Support.",
    "abstract": "Background: Patients with end-stage heart failure-related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS) are conclusively associated with a poor health-related quality of life (HRQL). Axillary mechanical circulatory support (aMCS), such as the Impella 5.5, is increasingly used in this population and may improve HRQL during hospitalization by providing enhanced left ventricular unloading. We aimed to assess changes in HRQL between admission and two weeks after Impella 5.5 placement in patients with HF-CS, using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Methods: We conducted a prospective longitudinal analysis on patients with the Impella 5.5 between May 2023 and July 2023. Participants completed the condensed KCCQ-12 at admission and again two weeks post-implantation. Changes in the scores were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Fifteen patients were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (50-63), and the median ejection fraction at implantation was 20% (15-30). On admission, most patients reported an overall HRQL of poor-to-fair (46.7%) according to the summary KCCQ-12 score. The median overall summary score increased significantly after Impella 5.5 support (50.52 vs. 28.13, p = 0.005). Symptom frequency (70.83 vs. 43.75, p = 0.009) and quality-of-life (50.00 vs. 12.50, p = 0.023) domains improved significantly, while physical limitation showed a positive trend and social limitation remained unchanged. These HRQL improvements occurred alongside a significant shift toward lower SCAI shock stages, marked increases in cardiac output and cardiac index, and no escalation in vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Conclusions: Impella 5.5 support in HF-CS patients was associated with early and clinically meaningful improvements in HRQL, particularly in symptom frequency and quality of life, during the critical pre-transplant or recovery period. These findings suggest that the Impella 5.5 may provide both physiological and patient-perceived benefits in this high-risk population.",

    "title": "Risk Stratification in Acute Coronary Syndromes: The Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index as Prognostic Marker.",
    "abstract": "Inflammation plays a key role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which integrates immune and inflammatory markers, may serve as a valuable prognostic tool. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of SII as a short-term predictor of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE) in ACS patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 964 ACS patients admitted in 2023. SII was calculated from admission hematological parameters. Primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and MACCE, respectively. SII levels differed significantly across ACS subtypes (p < 0.001), highest in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and lowest in unstable angina. SII was markedly higher in deceased patients (2003.79 ± 1601.17) vs. survivors (722.04 ± 837.25; p < 0.001) and remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 1.038, p < 0.001). Similarly, SII was elevated in MACCE cases (1717 ± 1611.32) vs. non-MACCE (664.68 ± 713.11; p < 0.001) and remained predictive in multivariate analysis (OR = 1.080, p < 0.001). Predictive accuracy for MACCE was moderate (AUC = 0.762), improved when combined with GRACE 2, especially in specificity (p = 0.07). In STEMI, SII had excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.874), outperforming neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein. SII rose at 24 h and declined at 48 h in STEMI, with a slower decline in MACCE patients. SII proved to be a cost-effective biomarker reflecting inflammation, immunity, and thrombosis. Elevated SII predicted short-term MACCE and mortality in ACS, with improved prognostic power when combined with GRACE 2. Persistent elevation may signal ongoing inflammation and increased MACCE risk.",

    "abstract": "Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) can complicate ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with a tenfold increase in mortality compared to those presenting without cardiac arrest. This study aimed to characterise STEMI patients presenting with OHCA to a single centre and to investigate the factors affecting their outcomes. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients on the National Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Register that presented over a six-year period with OHCA. The hospital's electronic health record was used to collect data on baseline characteristics, STEMI diagnosis, treatment and outcomes. There were 478 OHCA presentations; 75 (16 %) were diagnosed with STEMI. Mortality rates were significantly lower amongst the STEMI patients (23 % vs 87 %). There was no significant difference in the characteristics of STEMI patients transferred directly to the coronary catheterisation lab (CCL) and initially treated in ED. Over 90 % of STEMI patients were successfully treated with PCI. Mortality was higher in STEMI patients that were initially transferred to ED, with this factor identified as an independent predictor of mortality. However, transfer to CCL after two hours was not associated with increased mortality, when compared to those transferred within an hour of hospital arrival. Mortality rates amongst studied STEMI patients presenting with OHCA were high. Although transfer to ED was associated with increased mortality, this finding may be explained by confounding factors, including more profound haemodynamic instability precluding STEMI diagnosis, and/or requiring transfer to ED for stabilisation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Purulent pericarditis is a rare, life-threatening condition that has become exceedingly uncommon due to widespread use of antibiotics. However, immunocompromised patients remain susceptible to such opportunistic infections. It is typically caused by direct extension or hematogenous spread from a secondary bacterial source. Case Description: We report a 55-year-old man with HIV cardiomyopathy who was transferred from an outside facility for chest pain and dyspnea, with an electrocardiogram suggestive of an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, prompting emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed normal coronary arteries. A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, leading to pericardiocentesis. The pericardial fluid analysis revealed a high white blood cell count and a significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite receiving antibiotics, the effusion reaccumulated, necessitating a subxiphoid pericardial wash and drainage. The xiphoid biopsy was consistent with acute osteomyelitis. The patient was discharged with long-term antibiotics and scheduled outpatient follow-ups. Conclusion: This case illustrates an unusual presentation of HIV-AIDS, highlighting advancements in managing pneumococcal pyopericardium with tamponade and the ongoing risk of opportunistic infections despite antiretroviral treatment. Though rare, pyopericardium can be fatal; so prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are essential to improve outcomes.",

A multicenter, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at three tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, with MI survivors as participants. The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia Heart (TSK-SV Heart), Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS), the 10-Item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Family Resilience Assessment Scale (FRAS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to collect data. Hierarchical regression analysis was employed to identify significant predictors of kinesiophobia. A total of 414 MI survivors participated. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the total explanatory power of the model was 56.9%, with sociodemographic factors accounting for 17.0% and cognitive, behavioral, psychological and social support factors accounting for 39.9%. Kinesiophobia was significantly associated with age, gender, education level, disease duration, number of complications, exercise intensity, exercise duration, exercise frequency, exercise self-efficacy (ESE), depression, self-perceived burden (SPB), mental resilience, family resilience, perceived social support (PSS), and actual social support (ASS). This study identified several sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors associated with kinesiophobia in MI survivors. Based on these findings, integrating psychological support, behavior-focused interventions, and strengthened social support systems may help reduce kinesiophobia in this population.",

    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes often have atypical presentations, especially in female and elderly populations, leading to considerable diagnostic challenges. Cardiac cephalgia (CC), or headache caused by myocardial ischemia, is a rare and often neglected manifestation, a situation that deserves the interest of medical professionals. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines to synthesize available literature on this intriguing phenomenon. A thorough search was conducted on six databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and EBSCO, targeting papers published between 2000 and 2023. Ten peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case reports, with a total participant pool of 80,202. Several emergent themes were noted: the potential for CC to be the only symptom of ischemia, diagnostic misattributions to primary headache disorders, and clinical resolution noted following nitrate therapy or coronary interventions. Notwithstanding the narrow breadth of available evidence, which stems mainly from case reports, the findings suggest that clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for CC in patients who present with unexplained headaches and cardiovascular risk factors. Contemporary clinical guidelines rarely recognize this presentation, and additional prospective studies are necessary to develop diagnostic criteria and incorporate cardiac investigations into headache evaluation protocols.",

    "title": "Outcomes of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction and the Impact of Impella: A Retrospective Single-Center Study.",
    "abstract": " ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) often requires urgent revascularization, with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as the primary strategy. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains essential in cases where PCI is either unfeasible or fails. Emergency CABG for STEMI is associated with high operative risk and poor outcomes, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients. The Impella device (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA) provides percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS), which stabilizes hemodynamics, enhances end-organ perfusion, and facilitates myocardial recovery through left ventricular unloading. These effects may allow for clinical stabilization before surgery, thereby reducing the need for emergency CABG and improving surgical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of CABG for STEMI and to assess how the introduction of Impella influenced its indications, timing, and patient selection.  We conducted a retrospective analysis of 59 consecutive patients with STEMI who underwent CABG between 2012 and 2023. Clinical data were obtained from the institutional electronic medical records for all patients included in this study. Patients were classified as requiring emergency, urgent, or elective procedures. Clinical and procedural data were compared before and after the introduction of Impella in 2019.  The hospital mortality occurred in one patient (1.7%), including one patient (3.3%) among emergent cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (43.3%) of emergency cases, five patients (27.8%) of urgent cases, and none of the elective cases. Sepsis and acute kidney injury were the most common complications. The length of stay in the intensive care unit was significantly longer for emergent cases than for urgent and elective cases. CABG for STEMI was performed in 49 cases before the introduction of Impella and in 10 cases afterward. This led to a decrease in the rate of CABG performed for STEMI from 11.2% to 4.3%. Although the difference was not statistically significant, the proportion of emergency CABG decreased from 53.1% to 40%, while urgent CABG increased from 26.5% to 50%, suggesting a trend toward surgical stabilization. Regarding the use of MCS, the rate increased from 53.1% (26 patients) before Impella introduction to 70% (seven patients) after, with Impella used in 20% (two patients) of the latter group.  CABG remains a viable option for patients with high-risk STEMI. Observations suggest that the use of Impella may be linked to a shift in CABG indications, from unsuitable PCI to failed PCI, and a tendency toward less emergent surgical timing.",

At the end of the experiment period the animals were sacrificed and collected the serum, heart tissue used for the experimental work.ResultsAccording to the network pharmacology analysis, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (PTGS2), Matrix metallo proteins -9 (MMP-9), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were identified as potential targets among the 97 common targets between Pg3G and myocardial injury. Further, we investigated that prominent cardiac indicator such creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were not elevated by ISO in the presence of Pg3G administration. Additionally, Pg3G administration decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines generated by ISO, including as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and TNF-α, suggesting its anti-inflammatory qualities. Additionally, Pg3G increased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and restored the activity of important antioxidant enzymes that were depleted by ISO-induced oxidative stress, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).DiscussionPg3G capacity to reduce ISO-induced inflammatory, fibrotic, and cardiac toxicity markers in myocardial tissue was demonstrated by gene expression investigations. Therefore, Pg3G may be considered for ISO-induced cardiac injury since it provides significant cardioprotection by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification categorizes post-infarction tissue injury into four stages, potentially improving risk stratification and guiding cardioprotective strategies. Its clinical and prognostic relevance in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains unclear. We aimed to compare clinical characteristics across CCS stages and validate their prognostic implications in STEMI. We analysed 1,109 STEMI patients included in three prospective studies. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed 3 (interquartile range 2-5) days after MI and patients were classified as follows: stage 1 (aborted MI), stage 2 (MI with necrosis and absence of microvascular injury), stage 3 (MI with necrosis and microvascular obstruction) and stage 4 (MI with necrosis and intramyocardial haemorrhage).This analysis revealed distinct patterns of clinical presentation, biomarker profiles and cardiac function at different CCS stages. There were differences in adverse clinical event rates and mortality between CCS stages (major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE]: 0.7%, 3.4%, 3.1%, 15.7%, p<0.001 and mortality: 0.7%, 1.7%, 0.9%, 6.3%, p<0.001). The CCS stage had a moderate to good predictive value for MACE and mortality (AUC 0.74 [95% CI: 0.68-0.80], p<0.001 and AUC 0.71 [95% CI: 0.61-0.80], p<0.001) at 12 months, respectively. CCS stages were independently associated with MACE in multivariable Cox regression (HR: 2.18 [95% CI, 1.70-2.78], p<0.001). This study describes clinical characteristics across CCS stages and provides insights into their prognostic implications in a large cohort of STEMI patients reperfused by PCI. These data should inform the use of CCS stages in future trial designs.",

This analysis used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021. IHD was defined as acute myocardial infarction, chronic stable angina, chronic IHD, and heart failure due to IHD. Major indicators used in this study were prevalence, death and DALYs. All estimates were reported as absolute counts and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population, along with their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Globally, IHD accounted for 254.3 (95%UI: 221.4 to 295.5) million prevalent cases, 9.0 (95%UI: 8.3 to 9.5) million deaths and 188.4 (95%UI: 177.0 to 198.1) million DALYs in 2021. There was a noticeable decline in the global age-standardized death rate (ASDR) [-31.6% (95%UI: -34.9 to -28.3)] and age-standardized DALYs (ASRDALYs) [-28.8% (95%UI: -32.5 to -25.2)] from 1990 to 2021, with an estimated annual percentage change of -1.3 (95%CI: -1.34 to -1.26) and - 1.2 (95%CI: -1.25 to -1.16), respectively. In 2021, the global prevalence, death, and DALY rates of IHD were higher among males across all age groups, while death and DALY rates reaching a peak in the oldest group for both sexes. Regionally, we found a nonlinear but negative association between age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) and SDI. Nationally, similar negative associations were observed between ASRDALYs and SDI. High systolic blood pressure and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were the factors contributing most to the deaths and DALYs due to IHD. Despite declining global age-standardized death and DALYs rates of IHD, sustained multilevel prevention strategies remain essential. This requires population-wide risk factor reduction, targeted interventions for high-risk populations, and strengthened community healthcare networks to ensure accessible, guideline-based management.",

Patients were classified by final SV daily dose (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg) at 18 months. Factors associated with eGFR changes were identified using multiple regression analysis. A total of 157 patients (mean age 74.8-77.9 years, 64.3% male) were stratified by daily SV dosage groups (50 mg, n = 20; 100 mg, n = 46; 200 mg, n = 62; 400 mg, n = 29). Baseline characteristics were similar across groups for eGFR, heart failure stage, diabetes history, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, proteinuria, and use of most heart failure medications. However, hypertension prevalence and systolic blood pressure differed significantly between groups (p < 0.05). One-way ANOVA revealed significant dose-dependent differences in eGFR changes among SV dosage groups (p < 0.05). In the final multiple linear regression model, SV dosage (p < 0.05) was a significant factor associated with eGFR changes, with proteinuria showing a trend toward significance. Sex and BNP levels ≥400 pg/dL were not significant. Sensitivity analysis converting SV dosage to a categorical variable confirmed these findings. Stratification by proteinuria status demonstrated dose-dependent relationships in both proteinuria-positive and proteinuria-negative subgroups, with more pronounced dose dependency in the proteinuria-positive group (p < 0.001). SV exhibits dose-dependent renoprotective effects in heart failure patients. Optimizing SV dosage may be beneficial for heart failure patients with concurrent kidney dysfunction, especially those with proteinuria.",

We performed a meta-analysis to find the difference between intravascular lithotripsy and rotational atherectomy regarding all-cause death, myocardial infarction, coronary perforation, slow/no-reflow, target vessel revascularization and procedural success. Using a random effects model, the results were reported as risk ratios. A total of nine studies with 2203 patients (intravascular lithotripsy, n=1004; rotational atherectomy, n=1199) were selected. Intravascular lithotripsy was associated with a reduced risk of coronary perforation (risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.62; P=0.0001) and increased procedural success (risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.06; P=0.0004).

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the efficacy of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in reducing the risks of non-fatal major cardiovascular events (NF-MACE) and mortality in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) remains controversial. This study aims to quantify the impact of PAP therapy on these risks and develop a predictive risk estimator. We conducted a multicentre, observational, prospective study involving 5358 individuals diagnosed with OSA, with a median follow-up of 14 years (IQR 10-15 years). We derived and validated a risk estimator of NF-MACE (including myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularisation procedures, and congestive heart failure) and all-cause mortality, incorporating PAP adherence alongside clinical and sleep-related data. The cohort's mean (sd) for age was 55±11 years, the Body Mass Index 32.0±5.4 Kg·m-2, and an apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 35 (±22) events/hour; 26% were females, and 1467 (37%) were PAP adherent. Over the follow-up period, 754 participants experienced NF-MACE, while 858 deaths were recorded. Significant predictors included prior cardiovascular events, non-HDL cholesterol ≥200 mg·dL-1, COPD diagnosis, AHI >30 events/hr, and age >60 years. PAP adherence was protective (OR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.56), and the absolute risk reduction varied depending on the baseline risk (median of 16%, IQR 12-18). The risk estimator yielded an AUROC of 0.75 and a Brier score of 0.17, with 64% sensitivity and 75% specificity. PAP therapy is associated with long-term risk reduction of NF-MACE and mortality in OSA patients, while the developed risk estimator enhances clinical decision-making regarding therapy initiation.",

    "abstract": "This review tracks the discovery of circadian biology in cardiovascular science, starting with early clinical observations of daily changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiovascular events. These patterns suggested that time of day matters, but it was not until the past two decades that the mechanisms and knowledge translation of these rhythms were uncovered. We describe the heart's intrinsic circadian properties and importantly how this leads to regulation of cardiac gene and protein expression, neuroendocrine and vascular rhythms, metabolism, cellular electrophysiology, and cell signaling pathways. Next, we explore emerging themes, including the impact of circadian timing on ischemic injury, cardiac aging, and trends in circadian desynchrony, sex, and interorgan crosstalk. Building on these discoveries, circadian medicine is beginning to reshape clinical care including timing of surgery, chronotherapies, biomarkers, ICU design, novel molecular drugs targeting the circadian clock, the role of the microbiome and time restricted eating, the new field of rest, and the concept of One Health and applications to veterinary medicine. Looking ahead we address new frontiers such as epigenetics, gene editing, and spaceflight. Together, these advances offer a roadmap for how circadian rhythms can be harnessed to improve cardiovascular health and disease outcomes, supporting longer and healthier lives.",

    "title": "Impaired Long Term Survival with Asymptomatic Peri-operative Myocardial Injury following Endovascular Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Peri-operative myocardial injury (PMI) is characterised by an acute but clinical asymptomatic increase in troponin levels. Its incidence in vascular surgery is underreported. Moreover, the impact of PMI on survival in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), who are particularly at risk owing to their cardiovascular burden, remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the incidence of PMI following infrarenal EVAR and its association with long term mortality. Pre-operative and consecutive post-operative high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) levels were retrospectively analysed from patients who underwent standard infrarenal EVAR in a Dutch tertiary hospital between 2012 and 2022. PMI was defined as a difference of ≥ 14 ng/L (ΔhsTnT) between pre-operative and post-operative troponin concentrations without clinical features of myocardial ischaemia. Patients with clinically evident myocardial infarction were excluded. The primary outcomes were the incidence of PMI and long term mortality. A secondary outcome was the association between the magnitude of ΔhsTnT and long term mortality, irrespective of PMI criteria. A total of 318 patients were included, with a median follow up of 43 months. PMI occurred in 38 patients (11.9%). Six year risk of mortality was statistically significantly higher in patients with PMI (42.1% vs. 23.6%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 - 3.92; p = .019). Age (adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.09; p ≤ .001) and American Society of Anesthesiologist score (adjusted HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.16 - 2.87; p = .009) were independent predictors of mortality. Statin therapy demonstrated protective advantages against mortality (adjusted HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 - 0.65; p < .001). Lastly, a significant association between the magnitude of ΔhsTnT and long term mortality was found (adjusted HR = 1.016/Δ 1 ng/L, 95% CI 1.004 - 1.029; p = .012). Asymptomatic PMI is relatively common following EVAR and is associated with impaired long term survival. HsTnT is a sensitive marker for identifying cardiac damage in patients undergoing EVAR. Prospective studies may strengthen the evidence of the potential association between PMI and post-EVAR mortality and clarify any benefit from intensified post-operative cardiac care.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the main cause of mortality attributable to air pollution. This study analyzes, for the first time, the association between levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter) and hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in hospitals of the Spanish National Health System. Data on air pollution, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, covering the period from 2016 to 2021. A total of 122 National Health System hospitals were geographically matched with environmental monitoring stations located within a 10 km radius. The study included 115 071 patients aged 18 years or older (mean age, 67 years; 28% women) who were discharged with a diagnosis of AMI during the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to each hospital, and a meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the estimates of the association between PM2.5 levels and variations in AMI hospital admissions. The association between PM2.5 pollution and in-hospital AMI mortality was analyzed using logistic regression models. Maximum 3-day average PM2.5 levels exceeding 10 μg/m3 were associated with an additional 21.9 AMI hospital admissions per 1000 (95%CI, 9.1-34.8; P < .001). Furthermore, PM2.5 levels above 25 μg/m3 (3-day moving average) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality due to AMI (OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.07-1.23; P < .001). This study identifies a significant association between elevated PM2.5 levels and increased hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to AMI in Spain, highlighting the importance of reducing air pollution as a critical factor in cardiovascular health.

    "abstract": "The issue of gender in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) emerged in the literature over 25 years ago. It became evident that, all other factors being equal, women with AMI had higher mortality rates than men. The e-MUST registry, which includes patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of less than 24 hours' duration managed by one of the 39 Mobile Emergency and Resuscitation Services (SMUR) in the Île-de-France region, has allowed for numerous gender-focused analyses. Key findings include: [1] higher mortality in women: women experiencing AMI have a higher mortality risk (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8) compared to men [2]. Younger age of onset in women: while the average age at AMI onset increased by 2.9 years in men between 2002 and 2021 (from 57.6 to 60.5 years; p < 0.05), it decreased by 3.1 years in women (from 73.7 to 70.6 years; p < 0.0001) [3]. Advanced age in a subset of women: women represented 22% of the total registry population but accounted for over 60% of nonagenarian patients. In this very elderly subgroup, the rate of myocardial reperfusion decisions rose from 50% in the early 2000s to over 90% by the early 2020s. This intervention was associated with a 58% reduction in mortality [4]. Nontraditional risk profiles: women with AMI often presented without traditional cardiovascular risk factors, or with risk factors not routinely screened for [5]. Circadian patterns and delayed calls: AMI in women frequently occurred in the early morning, peaking at 08:00. Call delays to emergency services increased with age and nighttime onset, reaching up to 300 minutes in women over 65 experiencing chest pain at 1 a.m [6]. Prehospital management: except for a slightly lower rate of myocardial reperfusion in women (93% vs. 96% in men; p < 0.0001), prehospital management, including anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, was comparable between genders [7]. Gender bias in medical regulation: analysis of SAMU call regulation revealed that both the patient's and the physician's gender influenced the decision to dispatch a SMUR unit-ranging from 49% when both regulator and patient were men to just 18% when both were women [8]. Need for targeted approaches: these findings underscore the necessity for increased awareness, dedicated training, and gender-specific emergency care protocols to improve outcomes in women with AMI.",

Coronary angiography revealed triple-vessel disease with an acute coronary artery occlusion, a long, heavily calcified proximal-to-mid left anterior descending artery stenosis, and a severely calcified proximal circumflex lesion. PCI revascularization was performed in 3 steps: primary PCI of the right coronary artery initially, then 3 days after, PCI of the circumflex artery using rotational atherectomy, scoring balloon dilation, and intravascular lithotripsy. Then, at Day 15, PCI of the left anterior descending artery with orbital atherectomy finished complete revascularization. This case underscores the importance of a comprehensive geriatric assessment-particularly frailty and physiological age-before selecting a revascularization strategy requiring the use of specific tools as advanced plaque-modification techniques and intravascular imaging, without any restriction according to age.",

This study aims to evaluate sequential applicability and prognostic relevance of combining SCAI stages and ML-based phenotypes for risk stratification of patients with CS. The authors retrospectively applied both classification systems at 6- to 12-hour intervals for the first 72 hours to patients from the multicenter CSWG (Cardiogenic Shock Working Group) registry. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A total of 7,716 CS patients were included (admission CSWG-SCAI stages A to E: n = 1,526, n = 1,602, n = 838, n = 2,445, and n = 1,305, respectively; phenotypes I to III: n = 2,963, n = 3,266, n = 1,487, respectively). Within 6 hours from admission, CSWG-SCAI stages and phenotypes changed in 78% and 77% of patients, respectively, then remained relatively unchanged throughout the first 72 hours. Combining ML-based phenotypes with CSWG-SCAI stages to subclassify patients improved risk stratification (mortality for stages C-I: 12%-14%, C-II: 22%-26%, D-I: 21%-23%, D-II: 31%-34%, and D-III: 37%-40%). Admission phenotypes II and III strongly increased the odds of CS progression from stages A-C to D-E or death within 72 hours of admission (phenotype II: OR: 1.2 [95% CI: 0.99-1.39]; P = 0.051; phenotype III: OR: 11.4 [95% CI: 3.50-36.95]; P < 0.0001). Most patients with CS reached phenotype I and stage D within 6 hours after admission. Combining ML-based phenotypes with CSWG-SCAI staging may facilitate the transition from typical treatment intensity-based approaches to mechanistic classification that reflects the heterogeneity within CS populations.",

However, scores such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score show only a modest performance for prediction of adverse endpoints. This retrospective single-center all-comer study uses data from the Heidelberg Registry of Atrial Fibrillation of 9,995 patients with non-valvular AF presenting to the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Heidelberg from June 2009 until March 2020. Per CHA2DS2-VASc, risk was classified as low (0 point in men, ≤ 1 point in females), intermediate, or high (≥2 points in men and ≥3 points in females). The predictive performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc score, with and without highly sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), was evaluated for a composite endpoint comprising stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or all-cause mortality. Performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the prediction of the composite endpoint was poor Area under the curve (AUC): 0.648 (95%CI: 0.638-0.657) particularly in patients at intermediate-risk AUC: 0.542 (95%CI: 0.508-0.575). Adding hs-cTnT improved discrimination substantially in intermediate-risk patients (AUC: 0.778, 95% CI: 0.748-0.805). Notably, no events occurred in intermediate-risk patients with undetectable hs-cTnT (<5 ng/L). In patients with AF at intermediate thromboembolic risk, the addition of hs-cTnT to the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score enhances prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

This study explores links between anti-allergic drugs and CVD risk, providing valuable insights for clinical pharmacotherapy. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed on 139 eQTLs for anti-allergic drugs in coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and atrial fibrillation (AF) cohorts, with validation in independent cohorts. Sensitivity analyses, transcriptomics analysis, enrichment analysis, and molecular docking were performed to evaluate the robustness of causality, potential pathways and binding affinity. Furthermore, the FAERS database evaluated the cardiovascular adverse events associated with prednisone in combination with cardiovascular drugs. Among the 11 anti-allergic drug targets significantly linked to CVDs, KAT2A inversely correlated with CAD risk, BAZ2B and CYP2C8 with AF risk, and ITGB2, TG and six other eQTLs were associated with HF risk. Notably, prednisone (targeting ITGB2, TG) and loratadine (targeting TSHR) elevated CVD risk, while zafirlukast (targeting KAT2A, POLB, BAZ2B) reduced it. The progression of CVDs may be influenced by the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and lipid accumulation, which could potentially be affected by the administration of prednisone and similar medications. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between the cardiovascular candidate drug quercetin and zafirlukast (POLB). Pharmacovigilance analysis indicated an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes with the concurrent use of prednisone and cardiovascular drugs. The comprehensive analyses indicate that certain anti-allergic drugs may heighten the risk of CVDs, suggesting caution with medications like prednisone.",

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the AIP and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Prospective observational study. Data were collected from consecutive patients with STEMI who received PCI at Fuyang People's Hospital from January 2023 to March 2024. A total of 334 patients with STEMI who underwent PCI. The adjusted AIP (aAIP) was calculated using the following formula: aAIP=log ((triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol × 100). The patient population was divided into four groups based on the aAIP quartiles. The primary outcome was MACEs, and the secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission as individual endpoints. Among 334 eligible patients, 68 (20.36%) experienced MACEs during a median follow-up of 8.70 months. After adjusting for confounders, continuous aAIP was positively correlated with MACEs in all three models. Patients in Q3 and Q4 had significantly higher MACE risks than Q1 (p<0.001 for each model), but no difference was observed between Q1 and Q2 (p>0.05 for each model). Compared with Q1, Q4 had significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (Model 2: HR=12.72, 95% CI 1.39 to 76.44 and Model 3: HR=16.18, 95% CI 1.66 to 117.50).

Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher aAIP was associated with increased risks of MACEs, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission (all log-rank p<0.0001), but not all-cause mortality (log-rank p=0.1534). No significant interactions between subgroups and the aAIP were observed (p>0.05 for interaction).

Incident AMI hospitalizations were analyzed from 2011 to 2021 from the National Inpatient Sample and stratified by age (young adults 18-54 years of age and older adults >54 years of age). Overall RF prevalence and trends in traditional (eg, hypertension) and nontraditional (eg, psychosocial factors) RFs were assessed. Subgroup analysis by sex and race/ethnicity was performed. Among 4,431,901 incident AMI hospitalizations, 974,521 (22%) were young adults. Hypertension (64.8%) and tobacco use (57.8%) were the most prevalent RFs in young adults overall. Among 5 traditional RFs, tobacco smoking and obesity were significantly higher in young adults compared to older adults. Among 12 nontraditional RFs, lowest income quartile, family history of ischemic heart disease, and psychiatric disorders were significantly higher in young adults. Within young adults, women and non-Whites had a higher prevalence of both traditional and nontraditional RFs. Across the study period, the prevalence of most traditional and nontraditional RFs in young adults increased significantly (Ptrend < 0.050 for all). Young adults with AMI have a different and increasing burden of both traditional and nontraditional RFs compared to older adults.

This study aimed to investigate temporal trends in the effect of beta-blocker therapy on outcomes of patients with AMI in a large, nationwide cohort. Patients with AMI enrolled in the Acute Coronary Syndromes Israeli Survey from 2000 to 2021 were included. They were categorized into three periods: early (2000-2004), mid (2006-2016), and late (2018-2021). Each period group was further divided into two subgroups based on LVEF (>40 and ≤40%) and then stratified by beta-blocker treatment status. The cohort consisted of 11 569 patients. Among patients with LVEF less than 40%, beta-blocker treatment was associated with improved 1-year survival rates in the early (9.1 vs. 20.4%; P < 0.001) and mid (10 vs. 20.6%; P < 0.001) periods only. Among patients with LVEF greater than or equal to 40%, beta-blocker treatment was linked to enhanced 1-year survival in patients enrolled in the early period (3.4 vs. 7.6%; P < 0.001), but not in the mid and late periods. The association between beta-blocker treatment and improved survival in patients with AMI has diminished over recent decades, regardless of LVEF. These findings are likely attributed to the advancements in contemporary medical and revascularization therapy. As such, our results may challenge current recommendations regarding beta-blocker therapy in AMI.",

    "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy is the standard therapy for the secondary prevention of acute and chronic coronary syndromes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The introduction of more potent antiplatelet agents and understanding of prognostic implications associated with bleeding have led to a substantial evolution in antiplatelet treatment regimens over the past decades. Several investigations have been conducted to better stratify patients undergoing PCI according to their ischemic and bleeding risks and to optimize antithrombotic regimens accordingly. One of the available strategies involves using platelet aggregation tests to determine the most suitable antiplatelet agent to combine with aspirin. Our aim was to evaluate the role of platelet function tests (PFT) in clinical practice in choosing dual antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing PCI: in this study, we compared the impact on ischemic and hemorrhagic cardiovascular events in a 5 year follow-up between patients treated according to standard guidelines and those treated with a platelet function test guided approach. This study included 490 patients with acute or chronic coronary syndrome who underwent percutaneous angioplasty between 2013 and 2016 and were subsequently treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients whose treatment strategy was based on PFT were 68.4% (n = 335), while others received standard therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the incidence of net adverse clinical events (NACE), defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding, according to the BARC scale. Follow-up was conducted 5 years after angioplasty by telephone contact or by consulting patients' medical records. Heart failure and stable angina were considered as secondary endpoints. From the univariate analysis, the incidence of NACE was significantly lower in patients who received tailored therapy (33.7% vs. 43.9% in the non-tailored group, p = 0.02). In addition, results showed that total length of implanted stents and left main coronary disease were independent risk factors for net adverse clinical events (NACE). Similarly, an initial diagnosis of N-STEMI or unstable angina was associated with an increased risk of adverse events during follow-up. In patients undergoing PCI, a tailored antithrombotic approach guided by PFT appears safe and effective, may represent a feasible strategy in contemporary practice and should be considered in case of high bleeding risk.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but evidence in Asian populations remains limited. We assessed the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on in-hospital, 30-day, and 30-day to 1-year mortality in a Northern Chinese real-world cohort. An electronic health record-based cohort was constructed from the Tianjin Health and Medical Data Platform from January 2013 to December 2022. Statistical analyses, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariable regression analysis, and propensity score matching, were undertaken to evaluate the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates. A total of 23,486 patients with both AMI and DM were included. Patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 5053) were younger (64.2 vs 67.2 years) and had a higher frequency of dyslipidemia (26.4% vs 18.5%) and history of percutaneous coronary intervention (17.1% vs 15.3%) than those who did not receive them. After multivariable adjustment, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors showed a lower mortality rate during hospitalization (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.58), at 30 days (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.36-0.53), and at 30 days to 1 year (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.73-1.00). These findings were further supported by propensity score matching and subgroup analyses, which consistently confirmed the reduction in mortality across all three time points. In a real-world electronic health record-based cohort in China, this study confirmed a mortality benefit with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with combined DM and AMI. Further studies are needed to validate these benefits across broader populations.",

However, little is known about the efficacy of oral nicorandil in this context, especially that parenteral forms are not widely available. To investigate the impact of oral nicorandil administered before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) on no-reflow and to assess the in-hospital and 3-month major adverse cardiac events (MACE). A total of 302 patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to the Nicorandil-group, who received pre-PPCI oral nicorandil 20 mg followed by maintenance 20 mg b.i.d. for 3 months, and the Control-group. The primary endpoint was no-reflow defined as TIMI flow ≤ 2. Secondary endpoints included myocardial blush grade (MBG), ST-segment resolution, electrocardiographic repolarization dispersion, and in-hospital and 3-month MACE. Baseline and follow-up echocardiography were performed. A 3-month cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed in a subset of 50 patients. Nicorandil-group showed significantly lower rates of no-reflow (11.9% vs 24.5%, p = 0.005), better MBG, higher rates of complete ST-resolution, and better indices of repolarization dispersion compared to the Control-group. Pre-PPCI nicorandil was among the independent protectors against no-reflow (OR = 0.43, 95%CI = 0.23-0.81, p = 0.01). The Nicorandil-group demonstrated significantly better LV function and lower MACE at follow-up. Three-month CMR data showed microvascular obstruction in two patients among the Control-group and none among the Nicorandil-group (p = 0.14). Oral nicorandil was associated with post-PPCI lower rates of no-reflow and improved myocardial reperfusion. Moreover, it showed improved LVEF and reduced MACE at 3 months.",

Recently, the GLP-1 RA semaglutide was reported to reduce cardiovascular events in ASCVD patients with overweight or obesity even in the absence of diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, this was included in the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for secondary prevention. We aimed to assess the number of inpatients with ASCVD who could qualify for therapy with GLP-1 RA. Using nationwide data from the Research Data Centre of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, a random 10% sample of all adult inpatients in 2022 was analyzed. The proportions of ASCVD, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were examined. The 10% sample included 1,446,420 patients with a mean age of 63.16 years, 52.50% were female. ASCVD was present in 229,619 inpatients (15.87%), including those with coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease or stroke. Among ASCVD patients, 79,516 individuals (34.63% of ASCVD patients) also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus and 15,624 individuals were diagnosed with obesity. Approximately half of those (N = 7,256) had ASCVD and obesity without diabetes mellitus (3.16% of ASCVD patients). Overall, 37.79% of ASCVD patients also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity. In this data sampling of German inpatients, more than one-third of ASCVD patients may qualify for GLP-1 RA therapy due to concomitant diabetes mellitus or obesity.

    "abstract": "Patients treated in tertiary cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) often arrive via transfer from other hospitals. This \"transfer population\" is poorly described and has been largely excluded from trials in critical care. The aim of this study was to characterize patients who are transferred from other hospitals to advanced CICUs. The Critical Care Cardiology Trials Network is an investigator-initiated network of predominantly North American CICUs. Consecutive CICU admissions during annual 2-month snapshots were submitted to the coordinating center (TIMI Study Group) and stratified by transfer vs nontransfer status. Adjustment was made for age, sex, study site, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. A total of 21,215 admissions (2017-2023) were included in the analysis. Transfers accounted for 38% of admissions and 42% of patient-CICU-days. The primary reason for admission was more likely to be acute coronary syndrome (36% vs 15% for nontransfers, P < 0.001). Transfers were more likely to have shock (35% vs 32%, P = 0.031) and to receive mechanical ventilation (26% vs 17%, P < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (8% vs 5%, P < 0.001), and invasive monitoring (42% vs 34%, P < 0.001). Transfers with shock more frequently received mechanical circulatory support (15% vs 8%, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher among transfers, accounting for 44% of all deaths (15% vs 11%, P < 0.001; adjusted OR: 1.15 [1.04-1.27]). Transfers account for more than 1 of 3 admissions to tertiary CICUs, require more complex care, and have higher mortality compared to nontransfers. These findings have implications for designing regional systems of care, hand-off communication, risk-adjusted reporting, and plans of care for this high-risk cohort.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) typically manage critically ill patients with acute cardiovascular (CV) conditions but may serve patients with non-CV critical illness when medical ICU (MICU) beds are unavailable. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical profiles and outcomes of \"MICU overflow\" admissions to the CICU. We used the Critical Care Cardiology Trials Network registry to compare CICU admissions without acute or major cardiac issues (MICU overflow) vs those with acute CV illness. Among 19,912 CICU admissions (2018-2023), 923 (4.6%) were MICU overflow, ranging from 0% to 26% across centers. MICU overflow admissions had higher median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores than CV admissions (5 vs 3; P < 0.001) and more commonly presented with respiratory failure (50.5% vs 24.6%; P < 0.001) and noncardiogenic shock (30.9% vs 8.0%; P < 0.001). MICU overflow status was associated with similar ICU mortality (adjusted OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.90-1.43; P = 0.28) but higher hospital mortality (adjusted OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.48-2.19; P < 0.001) vs CV illness. In units where the CICU team managed all admissions, ICU mortality was higher among MICU overflow admissions than CV admissions (adjusted OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.02-1.80; P = 0.04), whereas in CICUs where off-unit MICU teams managed MICU overflow admissions, this mortality imbalance was not present (adjusted OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.47-1.11; P = 0.14; P interaction = 0.02). MICU overflow admissions constitute a meaningful proportion of the CICU population and present with more multisystem disease and experience higher hospital mortality compared with acute CV admissions, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary CICU teams with broad critical care expertise.",

    "abstract": "Mexico faces health policy challenges because of rising prevalence of health conditions, a rapidly aging population, and disparities in health care access. Nationally-representative longitudinal surveys released in recent years allow for projections of health care needs that can support policymakers to mitigate these challenges. This study validates the Mexico Future Older Adult Model (MFOAM), a dynamic microsimulation model for Mexico's aging population. Using 2012-2018 data from individuals aged 51+ in the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), the simulation builds on the Future Elderly Model from the United States. The model predicts lifetime health outcomes and risk factors, functional limitations, and mortality. Internal validation compares simulation outcomes to survey data at the individual and cohort level. External validation compares outcomes with 2012-2021 data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT). Internal and external validation showed robust performance. Population projections indicated almost a doubling of the 51+ population in Mexico between 2018 and 2051, with increasing prevalence of hypertension (52.3% to 66.1%), diabetes (24.6% to 31.9%), respiratory disease (10.2% to 15.1%), myocardial infarction (5.5% to 9.7%), stroke (4.3% to 8.0%), cancer (3.6% to 7.0%), and functional limitations (6.6% to 10.2%), reflecting national health trends. The MFOAM projects population outcomes through 2051, or specific age cohorts until all members reach the end of their lives. Harmonized variables from the Gateway to Global Aging allow for cross-country comparisons and expansion with other health and economic variables. These forecasts help support policy planning and health care strategies in Mexico.",

This multidisciplinary consensus statement, jointly developed by the EACVI, ACVC, and EACTAIC, provides comprehensive, practical guidance on the use of CUS in acute care settings. The document outlines a pathophysiological framework for applying CUS across a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, including cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, mechanical complications, acute heart failure, severe valvular disease, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac arrest. It describes key ultrasound modalities, measurement techniques, and diagnostic considerations essential for accurate interpretation and decision-making. Emphasis is placed on integrating CUS with multimodal imaging and organ-specific ultrasound to improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. The consensus further defines recommended training pathways, competence levels, and governance standards to ensure high-quality practice and mitigate medicolegal risks. Looking ahead, the document highlights future perspectives, including the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, big data, and connected technologies to enhance CUS capabilities. By standardising approaches and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, this statement aims to optimise patient outcomes and advance the role of cardiac ultrasound as a cornerstone of emergency and critical cardiovascular care.",

This prospective cohort study included patients with office systolic blood pressure (SBP) at least 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP at least 90 mmHg. Patients treated with RDN were matched to hypertensive controls from the population-based Rotterdam Study using one-to-many variable-ratio propensity score matching. The primary safety outcome was a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, renal failure and mortality. The primary efficacy outcome was the 5-year change in office SBP. A total of 53 RDN patients were matched to 238 population-based controls. Median age [25th-75th percentile] was 60.5 [56.5-68.4] years (46% female). Baseline BP ±SD was 166.1/95.5 ± 20.6/10.9 mmHg. Patients were prescribed 2.8 [1.5-4.5] defined daily dosages of antihypertensive drugs. The incidence of the primary safety outcome was similar among the RDN group and the control group at 5 years [13 vs. 18%; hazard ratio 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-2.38; P = 0.87]. The 5-year change in SBP was -12.0 [-18.0, -6.0] mmHg in the RDN group (P < 0.001) and -14.9 [-22.5 to -7.3] mmHg in the control group (P < 0.001), with no significant between-group difference [2.9 (-6.6 to 12.4) mmHg; P = 0.55]. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension undergoing RDN did not have a significantly lower risk for future adverse cardiovascular events as compared to hypertensive controls from a population-based study. No difference in office BP was observed at 5 years. While real-world observational data could provide valuable insights, randomized trials are needed to confirm the role of RDN in improving long-term outcomes.",

Less is known about race and sex differences in comorbidity burden and quality of care outcomes after CA. We sought to characterize racial and sex differences in patient and procedural characteristics and their impact on prolonged length of stay (LOS) after CA for AF. A retrospective cohort of patients that received CA for AF between 2018 and 2024 was developed from our single center NCDR registry. The analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients due to small sample sizes for other groups. The association between race, sex, and prolonged LOS was evaluated using a multivariable stepwise regression model. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the composite outcome of complications given its sparsity. Causal mediation analysis was performed to assess whether race differences in prolonged LOS were mediated by complications. Between 2018 and 2024, 3345 patients were included in the cohort. NHB patients were younger and more likely to have Medicaid insurance, higher BMI, higher comorbidity burden, history of atrial flutter, prolonged LOS, and complications after ablation. They were less likely to have prior CA. Female patients were older, less likely to have private insurance and prior CA, and more likely to have paroxysmal AF, transient ischemic attack, and chronic lung disease. NHB race [aOR 1.90 (95% CI: 1.24-2.88), p = 0.003] and a composite outcome of procedural complications [aOR 156 (95% CI: 72.5-377), p < 0.001], but not sex, were independently associated with prolonged LOS. The effect of race on prolonged LOS was partially mediated by higher comorbidity burden and obesity among NHB, but not by complications, Medicaid status, or AF type. Prolonged LOS was more frequent among NHB patients undergoing CA. The higher odds of prolonged LOS among NHB patients was not mediated by a higher incidence of complications, suggesting that other factors like comorbidity burden and social determinants of health (SDOH) are more significant contributors. Policies focused on improving comorbidity management and addressing sociocultural disparities may reduce prolonged hospitalizations after CA for AF.",

    "abstract": "Introduction ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a severe form of coronary artery disease (CAD) often associated with systemic inflammation. The fibrinogen-albumin ratio (FAR) has been proposed as a novel inflammatory marker with potential prognostic value. The Gensini score, derived from coronary angiography, quantifies the severity of CAD. This study aimed to assess the correlation between FAR and Gensini score in STEMI patients. Materials and methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Karnataka, India, from May 2023 to December 2024. Seventy patients with a clinical diagnosis of STEMI were enrolled. Clinical evaluation, blood tests (including fibrinogen and albumin levels), echocardiography, and coronary angiography were performed. FAR was calculated by dividing fibrinogen (g/L) by albumin (g/L), and Gensini scores were computed to assess CAD severity. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation and the chi-squared test. Results The study population comprised mostly men (47, 67.14%) and individuals aged over 60 years (40, 57.14%). Single and double vessel disease were each present in 24 (34.3%) patients. FAR >0.1 was seen in 37 (52.86%). A significant association was found between Gensini score and the extent of vessel disease (p=0.0001); however, FAR did not show a statistically significant correlation with Gensini score (r=-0.002; p=0.989). FAR also lacked a significant association with heart failure types. Conclusion FAR may have limited utility in predicting angiographic severity in patients with STEMI. While it remains a simple and economical inflammatory marker, its prognostic relevance in acute coronary events appears uncertain. Further research with larger cohorts is warranted to validate its clinical applicability.",

Methotrexate (MTX) is a potent anti-inflammatory drug with potential benefits in the treatment of STEMI. Experimental studies have suggested that a formulation of MTX incorporated into lipid nanoemulsion (LDE-MTX) could be beneficial and safe. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDE-MTX in patients with STEMI. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study. Patients were randomized 4 ± 2 days after first anterior STEMI to receive LDE-MTX (40 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) or LDE-placebo weekly for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance at 90 ± 7 days post-randomization; the main secondary endpoints were changes in LVEDV, other LVR parameters and IS. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the study was stopped prematurely, with 32 randomized patients (15 LDE-placebo, 17 LDE-MTX) completing the protocol. At 90 days, there was no difference in LVEDV between groups. Among other secondary endpoints, there appeared to be a greater reduction of IS (%LV) in favor of the LDE-MTX group (-3.9 ± 6.9 vs -9.4 ± 8.4, p = 0.030). LDE-MTX was well tolerated. In patients with STEMI, LDE-MTX appears to be safe but did not influence LVEDV and other LVR parameters, although it possibly reduced infarct size at 90 days.

This retrospective case-control study included 8,999 AMI patients hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2018 to December 2022, among whom 88 developed ICT. To address class imbalance, 891 non-ICT patients were randomly selected as controls using a 1:10 ratio. Inflammation-related biomarkers were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and a risk heatmap was generated based on key predictors. Multivariate logistic regression identified elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and reduced albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) as independent risk factors for ICT.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a rare neurological emergency that can mimic acute myocardial infarction due to overlapping symptoms such as chest and back pain. Misdiagnosis may lead to inappropriate treatments such as anticoagulation, potentially worsening the patient's condition. We report a 64-year-old woman with hypertension and a history of breast cancer who presented with chest and upper back pain, accompanied by left arm numbness. Mildly elevated troponin levels led to an initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Brain imaging was unremarkable, and coronary angiography revealed normal vessels. However, progressive left-sided hemiparesis and urinary retention prompted cervical magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a subacute epidural hematoma at the C5-C7 level. Urgent decompressive hemilaminotomy was performed, resulting in gradual neurological recovery. By postoperative day 10, the patient had regained full motor strength. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of SSEH presenting with atypical chest symptoms. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for spinal pathology in patients with axial pain and evolving neurological deficits, even when initial cardiac evaluations are suggestive of ACS. Timely spinal imaging is critical to avoid harmful interventions and enable prompt surgical treatment.",

    "title": "Adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and related factors in STEMI after PCI in China: a sequential explanatory mixed method study protocol.",
    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction remains a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Cardiac rehabilitation is widely recognized as an essential component of the comprehensive medical management for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, especially among those who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention. Adherence to cardiac rehabilitation encompasses patient collaboration with a healthcare provider, active involvement in the treatment regimen, and persistence in practice, characterized by self-efficacy and relapse prevention. Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation constitutes the second phase of the continuum of care, bridging the inpatient and long-term maintenance stages. However, adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs in China remains suboptimal. The factors influencing outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention have not yet been fully elucidated. To investigate the status and influencing factors of adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention one month after discharge in China and gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon of interest. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design will be employed to conduct this study with three phases. The first phase is a quantitative study with a cross-sectional design to assess the level of adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and related influences based on the Health Belief Model among 198 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention in two tertiary hospitals in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The second phase is followed by a qualitative study to explore the patients' perceived facilitators and barriers to adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Purposive sampling, semi-structured interviews, and conventional content analysis approaches will be used to collect and analyze the data. The final phase links to integrating the data and developing a targeted strategy to improve adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention. The nominal group technique and &quot;weaving techniques&quot; will be implemented in accordance with the results of the preceding two phases. A targeted strategy to improve outpatient cardiac rehabilitation adherence would be designed considering the factors affecting adherence to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention. This study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2400080035.",

    "title": "Postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge disposition following single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion in elderly and octogenarian patients.",
    "abstract": "Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) has become a widely accepted treatment for degenerative lumbar spine pathologies, with increasing prevalence due to its effectiveness in restoring lumbar lordosis and improving spinal balance. This study aims to evaluate postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and discharge disposition following ALIF across different age groups. A total of 92,800 weighted cases of patients aged 50 and older underwent single-level ALIF in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2020. Patients were stratified into age cohorts (50-64, 65-79, 80+). Exclusions were made for non-elective cases and missing data on key variables. Primary outcomes included postoperative complications (anemia, DVT, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, sepsis, anesthesia-related complications), LOS, and discharge disposition. Statistical comparisons between age groups were conducted using chi-square tests with a Bonferroni correction. Significance was set at P < 0.005. The study identified significant variations in outcomes across age groups. The mean age differed significantly (P < 0.001). Older patients had higher rates of comorbidities and complications, with acute post-hemorrhagic anemia being most prevalent in the 65-79 group (16.78 %) and sepsis more common in the 80+ group (0.90 %). The LOS increased with age (P < 0.001), and total admission charges were highest in the 65-79 age group (P = 0.004). Routine discharge rates decreased significantly with age, while non-routine discharges increased (P < 0.001). Age significantly influences postoperative outcomes following ALIF. Patients aged 65 and older are at increased risk for various complications, longer hospital stays, and non-routine discharges. These findings highlight the need for tailored perioperative care and robust discharge planning to improve outcomes for elderly patients undergoing ALIF. As with all retrospective database studies, this analysis is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and the absence of granular clinical details within the NIS.",

A retrospective cohort study utilizing the TriNetX US Collaborative Network. The study included 9081 patients with T2DM who underwent PPV for DR, 363 116 patients with T2DM with DR but no PPV, 92 645 patients with T2DM without DR, and 3 264 709 healthy individuals, all aged ≥18 years. We identified cohorts using specific International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and Current Procedural Technology codes. We used propensity score matching to adjust for covariates including age, gender, race, ethnicity, systemic pathology, and ocular conditions unrelated to diabetes. The primary outcome measures were the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality, MI, stroke, and amputation at 1, 3, and 5 years after PPV compared with the control groups. Patients with T2DM undergoing PPV for DR had higher risk of systemic events and mortality. Compared with patients with DR not requiring PPV, the PPV cohort had a higher risk at 1 year for stroke (HR: 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 2.21) and amputation (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.16). At 3 years, the risks for MI (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.78), stroke (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.07), and amputation (HR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.54, 3.05) were significantly elevated. At 5 years, the risks for mortality (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.43), MI (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.78), stroke (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.91), and amputation (HR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.58, 2.81) were all significantly higher. When compared with diabetic patients without DR or healthy patients, the PPV cohort faced higher risk of each health outcome analyzed at intervals of 1, 3, and 5 years. We found a significant association between patients with T2DM with DR requiring PPV and an increased risk of mortality, MI, stroke, and amputation compared with non-PPV patients with DR, diabetics without DR, and healthy individuals. These findings underscore the need for monitoring and management of systemic health in diabetic patients undergoing PPV for advanced DR.

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is responsible for the majority of deaths worldwide and depression can intensify the detrimental cycle of heart-brain remodeling after MI. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is an effective non-invasive neuromodulation strategy for treating depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) can convert the mechanical energy of organism into electrical energy to achieve self-powering. Self-powered vagal neuromodulation based on PENGs have been used for neural stimulation and CVD treatment. We aim to determine the interaction between heart and central amygdala (CeA), integrate self-powered PENG technology into taVNS system and explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of taVNS on heart-CeA remodeling after MI. Neural tracing and chemogenetic technologies were used to confirm the heart-CeA connectivity. A four-weeks taVNS treatment was promoted after MI induction in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Then, depression-like behaviors and cardiac remodeling were evaluated. Besides, neuronal activity and neuroinflammation levels were assessed and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated. The self-powered PENG technology was integrated into the taVNS system and its neuromodulation effectiveness was evaluated. MI increased neuronal activity in the CeA and depression-like behaviors, and over-activation of the CeA led to cardiac dysfunction, resulting in malignant feedback. taVNS attenuated MI-induced \"heart-CeA\" remodeling, improved cardiac function, and reduced depression-like behaviors by ameliorating the neuroinflammatory response via MLCK pathway in the CeA. In addition, the self-powered PENG-based system enabled effective transcutaneous neuromodulation. PENG-based self-powered taVNS holds potential for heart-brain neuromodulation, offering a synergistic strategy for treating cardiac and mental co-morbidities after MI.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a common pathological phenomenon during the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies suggest that macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in MIRI progression. However, whether quercetin mitigates MIRI by modulating macrophage polarization and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The protective effects of quercetin against MIRI were assessed using TTC-Evans blue staining, echocardiography, and myocardial enzyme assays. Histological changes, including myocardial fibrosis, were evaluated via HE and Masson staining. Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze macrophage M1/M2 polarization. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were conducted to determine whether quercetin regulates M2 polarization through autophagy modulation. Quercetin significantly reduced infarct size, improved cardiac function, and alleviated inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that quercetin downregulated M1 markers while upregulating M2 markers and enhancing IL-10 secretion. In vitro experiments further confirmed that quercetin promoted M2 macrophage polarization under H/R conditions, thereby attenuating cardiomyocyte injury through a paracrine mechanism. Mechanistically, quercetin facilitated autophagic flux by reducing the binding affinity between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, leading to enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, an effect partially reversed by 3-MA. This study provides the first evidence that quercetin exerts cardioprotective effects in MIRI by promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, it elucidates a novel molecular mechanism in which quercetin regulates autophagy to drive M2 polarization, offering experimental support for quercetin as a potential therapeutic strategy for MIRI.",

However, it is associated with a high risk of complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), which increases the need of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and is linked to worse clinical outcomes. To identify clinical and biochemical factors independently associated with the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in adult patients receiving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A retrospective case-control study that included patients who received VA-ECMO and were admitted to the intensive care unit between 2019 and 2023. The incidence of RRT, along with associated severity and mortality scores, was analyzed using multivariate analysis. A total of 279 patients were included, among whom 98 received VA-ECMO support. Of these, 26.5% required RRT, and the mortality rate was 57.7%. The majority of patients were male (62.2%), with a mean age of 45.3 years (SD ± 13.8). Factors associated with the need for RRT included the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06), history of hypothyroidism (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.27-12.86), and elevated creatinine levels prior to ECMO initiation (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.09). Additionally, the APACHE II score (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-1.10) and renal angina index (OR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.77-15.77) were predictors of mortality. Patients undergoing VA-ECMO who require RRT have a high mortality risk. Associated factors include hypothyroidism, elevated creatinine levels before ECMO initiation, and a higher renal angina index. The early identification of these factors may facilitate the early detection of AKI risk and optimize clinical management. Not applicable.",

A cellular model of AMI was constructed by hypoxia-induced HUVECs. miRNAs that may interact with circ_0091761 were recognized by the ENCORI and circular RNA Interactom databases. RT-qPCR was performed to analyze the levels of circ_0091761 in AMI patients as well as miR-1278, ICAM1, and VCAM1 in hypoxia-induced HUVECs. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. ROS kit and LDH kit were used to detect the levels of ROS and LDH, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of a randomized, open-label, multinational trial comparing fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided vs intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided treatment strategies. Patients aged ≥19 years with de novo intermediate coronary stenosis (40%-70%) and target vessel diameters ≥2.5 mm were randomized 1:1 to FFR- or IVUS-guided treatment across 18 sites in Korea and China. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and any revascularization occurring after the index procedure. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary outcome and per vessel outcomes according to treatment type. Extended follow-up continued through September 2024. Between July 2016 and August 2019, 1,682 patients were assigned to the FFR-guided (n = 838) and IVUS-guided (n = 844) groups. Over a median follow-up period of 6.3 years (Q1-Q3: 5.6-6.9 years), the primary outcome occurred in 339 patients (22.0%), with no statistically significant difference between groups (179 [23.1%] for FFR vs 160 [20.9%] for IVUS; HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.93-1.42; P = 0.208). The revascularization rate after the index procedure was higher in the FFR group (113 [14.9%] vs 87 [11.8%]; HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.00-1.75; P = 0.049), particularly for target vessel revascularization (72 [9.6%] vs 44 [6.2%]; HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.15-2.43; P = 0.007). Landmark analysis at 2 years and per vessel analyses indicated that the higher revascularization rate after the index procedure was driven primarily by late (2-7 years) revascularizations in vessels in which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was initially deferred. Nevertheless, the overall rate of target vessel PCI, including procedures at index and during follow-up, was significantly lower in the FFR group (38.8% vs 60.5%; P < 0.001), with no statistically significant differences in the annual cumulative incidence of death or myocardial infarction between groups. FFR-guided and IVUS-guided treatment strategies resulted in comparable long-term outcomes, with no significant difference in patient-oriented composite outcomes. Although FFR-guided treatment was associated with a higher incidence of late target vessel revascularization, the overall target vessel PCI rate, accounting for both the index procedure and revascularization during follow-up, remained significantly lower in the FFR-guided treatment group, with comparable rates of hard outcomes between the 2 groups.",

Females, older adults, and residents living in rural-dominated mixed regions experienced higher compound exposures. During the study period, the estimated number of excess cardiopulmonary deaths attributable to compound events exposure under various definitions ranged from 243 (95 % CI: 201-285) to 3227 (95 % CI: 2974-3480). More than 90 % of these excess deaths occurred after 2017 and were primarily concentrated in densely populated northern and central-eastern townships.

National representative data of 5,419 older adults from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 were used in this study. The number and type of CDs were incorporated into Models 1 and 2, respectively, using five ML methods. The average age of the participants was 72.7 years, with 43.2% males, 15.2% reporting depression, and 7.3% reporting SI. The number of CDs was correlated with increased depression and SI. The ML models showed moderate-to-good performance in the prediction of depression and SI. The area under the curve (AUC) values for Model 1 ranged from 0.729 to 0.772 for depression, and from 0.754 to 0.793 for SI. In Model 2, the AUC ranged from 0.704 to 0.768 for depression and from 0.750 to 0.785 for SI. More depression and SI were expected when the number of CDs was one or more and two or more, respectively. The top predictors of depression were osteoarthritis, myocardial infarction, diabetes, asthma, and stroke, whereas those predicting SI were stroke, hypertension, asthma, myocardial infarction, and rheumatoid arthritis. The number and specific types of CDs predicted depression and SI among Korean older adults. These results may help enhance cooperation with clinicians treating CDs and promote the early detection and prevention of further SI and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) contain valuable information in the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). However, its interpretation process is dependent on cardiologists with extensive clinical experience and expertise. The issue not only causes a paucity of medical resources, but also restricts patients from receiving timely diagnoses. Thus, a novel approach for MI automatic detection is developed, based on 12-lead ECG and an improved state refinement for long short-term memory (LSTM) determined 3D convolution-attention (3D CAISR-LSTM) model. The proposed 3D CAISR-LSTM model is trained in an end-to-end fashion. The input 12-lead ECG signals are preprocessed to eliminate power line interference, high-frequency noise and baseline wander. Then, the ECG signals are transformed into time-frequency images using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and bilinear interpolation. The obtained images are constructed into three-dimensional spatiotemporal features, serving as input to the 3D CAISR-LSTM model. In the 3D CAISR-LSTM model, there are three main components: a convolutional module, four identical convolutional attention modules, and an improved state refinement for LSTM. Performance of the 3D CAISR-LSTM model in automatic detection of MI versus healthy controls (HC) is evaluated through ten-fold cross validation on the publicly available PTB diagnostic ECG database. Experimental results demonstrate that the 3D CAISR-LSTM model achieves an accuracy of 98.45%, sensitivity of 98.69%, specificity of 97.50%, and F1 score of 99.03%, outperforming various advanced 2D and 3D deep neural network architectures. The proposed approach is expected to provide an early warning before obvious MI symptoms appear. It also has the potential to be developed into a lightweight embedded MI detection equipment.",

    "title": "Differentiating Type 1 and Type 2 myocardial infarction using a machine learning algorithm and biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "Treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) differs based on MI type, which can be difficult to determine in the emergency department. This study sought to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm (MI3) in combination with N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) can accurately differentiate MI type. We conducted a secondary analysis of the multisite CMR-IMPACT trial, which prospectively enrolled adults with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and an initial indeterminate troponin. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of MI and an initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI; Abbott Laboratories) measure were included. Incidence of MI and MI type were adjudicated by expert reviewers. Receiver operator characteristic curves for MI-type were created and area under the curve (AUC) calculated for MI3 and MI3 with NT-proBNP and Gal-3. AUCs were compared using DeLong's method. Among 123 patients with adjudicated MI, the mean age was 60±12 years and 37.4% (46/123) were female. Type 1 MI occurred in 58.5% (72/123) and type 2 MI in 41.5% (51/123). MI3 based on an initial hs-cTnI yielded an AUC of 0.704 (95% CI 0.611-0.797) for MI type. When combined with NT-proBNP and Gal-3, AUC improved to 0.789 (95% CI 0.709-0.869, p=0.0165). In patients with serial hs-cTnIs (n = 86), the AUC of MI3 for MI type was 0.721 (95% CI 0.614-0.829) and increased to 0.797 (95% CI 0.700-0.894, p=0.09) with the addition of NT-proBNP and Gal-3. Adding NT-proBNP and Gal-3 to the MI3 machine learning algorithm shows promise in differentiating type 1 from type 2 MI.",

    "abstract": "Characteristics and outcomes associated with cardiogenic shock (CS) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in older patients have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate characteristics and outcomes of older patients admitted with CS with AMI. We used the National Inpatient Sample database to evaluate clinical characteristics of hospitalizations, clinical outcomes, and health care utilization of hospitalizations of older patients ≥80 years with CS and AMI from 2003 to 2021. We also compared data from older patients with a reference relatively younger patient population (18-79 years). During the study period, 207,333 hospitalizations of older patients ≥80 years and 675,491 hospitalizations of patients 18 to 79 years were identified. Between the first 4 years of the study period (2003-2006) and the final 4-year interval of the study period (2016-2019), there was an increase in the number of hospitalizations of older patients with AMI and CS (39,220-51,640). On adjusted analysis, there were increases in the percentage of older patients undergoing treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention (19.2% to 34.1%; P < 0.001) and encounters for palliative care (2.0% to 32.4%; P < 0.001) alongside a decline in in-hospital mortality (61.4% to 49.0%; P < 0.001) over the study period. Compared to patients 18 to 79 years of age, those aged ≥80 years had greater in-hospital mortality (51.8% vs 33.0%; P < 0.001). From 2003 to 2021, for older patients with CS and AMI, hospitalizations increased, and mortality decreased.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between preoperative subclinical inflammation, quantified by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and postoperative outcomes following open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (TAAAr). This was a retrospective analysis from a single high-volume aortic center using the institutional aortic database. All patients who underwent TAAAr between 1997 and 2024 and had preoperative testing needed for NLR calculation were eligible. Maximally selected rank statistics were utilized to identify optimal NLR cutoff. Multivariable regression analysis, adjusted for key prognostic and surgical variables, was used to identify association. The primary outcome was cumulative mortality. The key secondary outcome was the composite incidence of in-hospital major adverse events (MAEs), including operative mortality (mortality prior to discharge), renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, reintervention for hemorrhage, need for tracheostomy, and gastrointestinal complications. A total of 591 patients were included. Operative mortality was low across the entire cohort (3.7% [22/591]). At median follow-up 84.0 ± 3.5 mo, the high-NLR (≥ 2.36) cohort (417/591) had higher cumulative mortality (40.3% [168/417] versus 25.9% [45/174], P = 0.001) compared to the low-NLR (<2.36) cohort. The high-NLR cohort also had increased incidence of MAEs (18.9% [79/417] versus 11.5% [20/174], P = 0.037). On multivariable analysis, NLR was independently associated with cumulative mortality (hazard ratio 1.05 95% confidence interval [1.01, 1.08], P = 0.01) and MAEs (odds ratio 1.07 95% confidence interval [1.01, 1.13], P = 0.027). NLR was independently associated with cumulative mortality and MAEs after TAAAr. NLR may provide a novel metric for risk stratification in this high-risk patient cohort.",

    "abstract": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) often experience psychological distress and reduced quality of life after stent implantation. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led peer support intervention on the psychological status and quality of life of patients with AMI post stent implantation. In this randomized controlled trial, 200 patients with AMI who underwent stent implantation were randomly assigned to either a nurse-led peer support intervention group (n = 100) or a standard care control group (n = 100). The intervention consisted of weekly 90-minute group sessions facilitated by trained nurses and peer supporters for 12 weeks. Psychological status was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale. Quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 12 weeks post intervention. Compared with the control group, individuals in the intervention group showed significantly lower anxiety (mean difference, -2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2 to -1.8; P < .001) and depression (mean difference, -2.1; 95% CI, -2.8 to -1.4; P < .001) scores at 12 weeks. Perceived stress levels were also significantly reduced in the intervention group (mean difference, -3.7; 95% CI, -4.5 to -2.9; P < .001). Quality of life scores improved significantly across all domains of the Short Form-36 in the intervention group, with the most notable improvements in emotional well-being (mean difference, 10.2; 95% CI, 7.1-13.3; P < .001) and social functioning (mean difference, 9.8; 95% CI, 6.7-12.9; P < .001). Medication adherence and perceived social support also improved significantly in the intervention group. Nurse-led peer support interventions significantly improve psychological status and quality of life in patients with AMI after stent implantation. These findings suggest that incorporating such interventions into standard care could enhance postoperative recovery and long-term outcomes for individuals with AMI.",

    "title": "Association between Glucose/lymphocytes Ratio and Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Myocardial Infarction without Diabetes Mellitus.",
    "abstract": "Glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation appears to be strongly related to many cardiovascular diseases. Glucose to lymphocyte ratio (GLR), a novel promising marker, has been recognized as a reliable predictor of prognosis in various cancers. However, there are still no studies on the association of cardiovascular disease with GLR. This analysis aimed to uncover the potential association between GLR and the risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in a ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) population. Clinical data of 592 nondiabetic STEMI patients managed with PPCI from February 2021 to February 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, missing laboratory data, cancers, inflammatory/infectious diseases, or died during the procedure or within 24 hours after the procedure were excluded. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff of GLR in CI-AKI. Based on the cutoff value, the study population was categorized into high-GLR (≥4.16) and low-GLR (<4.16) groups. The level of significance adopted in the statistical analysis was 5%. The overall CI-AKI incidence was 7.4%. The high-GLR group showed a higher CI-AKI incidence in comparison to the low-GLR group (30.9%vs1.3%, p<0.001). Following adjustment for potential confounders, high-GLR still served as an independent predictor for CI-AKI (odds ratio [OR] 45.100, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.312-278.174, p<0.001), as well as creatinine at admission (OR:10.459, 95%CI 1.169-93.583, p=0.036). In conclusion, a high GLR level served as an independent risk factor for CI-AKI evolution after PPCI in subjects with STEMI without diabetes mellitus. O metabolismo da glicose e a inflamação sistêmica parecem estar fortemente relacionados a muitas doenças cardiovasculares. A relação glicose-linfócito (RGL), um novo marcador promissor, tem sido reconhecida como um preditor confiável de prognóstico em vários tipos de câncer. No entanto, ainda não existem estudos sobre a associação entre doenças cardiovasculares e GLR. Esta análise teve como objetivo investigar a possível associação entre RGL e o risco de lesão renal aguda induzida por contraste (LRAIC) após intervenção coronária percutânea primária (ICPP) em uma população de pacientes com infarto agudo do miocárdio com elevação do segmento ST (IAMST). Os dados clínicos de 592 pacientes com IAMST não diabéticos tratados com ICPP entre fevereiro de 2021 e fevereiro de 2023 foram analisados retrospectivamente. Pacientes com doença renal terminal, dados laboratoriais ausentes, câncer, doenças inflamatórias/infecciosas ou que faleceram durante o procedimento ou dentro de 24 horas após o procedimento foram excluídos. A curva característica de operação do receptor (ROC) foi utilizada para determinar o valor de corte ideal da RGL na LRAIC. Com base nesse valor de corte, a população do estudo foi categorizada em grupos de RGL alta (≥4,16) e RGL baixa (<4,16). O nível de significância adotado na análise estatística foi de 5%. A incidência geral de LRAIC foi de 7,4%. O grupo de RGL alta apresentou uma incidência maior de LRAIC em comparação ao grupo de RGL baixa (30,9% vs. 1,3%, p<0,001). Após ajuste para potenciais fatores de confusão, a RGL alta continuou sendo um preditor independente para LRAIC [razão de chances (OR) 45,100, intervalo de confiança (IC) 95% 7,312-278,174, p<0,001], assim como a creatinina na admissão (OR: 10,459, IC 95% 1,169-93,583, p=0,036). Em conclusão, a RGL elevada foi um fator de risco independente para o desenvolvimento de LRAIC ICPP em indivíduos com IAMST sem diabetes mellitus.",

These conditions are frequently associated with comorbidities, including renal dysfunction. To evaluate the association between creatinine clearance and the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes within 1 year in patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This prospective cohort study included patients hospitalized for their first AMI. Creatinine clearance was assessed in relation to cardiovascular outcomes, including recurrent AMI, stroke, and cardiovascular death. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 1,324 patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 60.9 ± 11.4 years; 67.4% were male. Creatinine clearance <60 mL/min was significantly associated with systemic arterial hypertension (79.6% vs. 55.1%, p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (40.8% vs. 24.5%, p<0.001), and dyslipidemia (38.8% vs. 31.4%, p=0.043). Higher creatinine clearance values were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year (HR: 0.992; 95% CI: 0.984-0.999; p=0.030). Additionally, higher clearance was linked to lower overall mortality (HR: 0.984; 95% CI: 0.970-0.998; p=0.021). Higher creatinine clearance values are associated with a lower hazard ratio for MACE and overall mortality within 1 year following AMI. As doenças cardiovasculares constituem a principal causa de mortalidade no mundo, gerando impactos sociais e econômicos significativos. Essas condições frequentemente coexistem com comorbidades, como a disfunção renal.

Ademais, verificou-se associação com menor mortalidade geral (HR: 0,984; IC 95%: 0,970-0,998; p=0,021). Valores mais elevados de depuração de creatinina associaram-se a menores razões de risco para MACEs e mortalidade geral no período de 1 ano após o IAM.",

We included noninstitutionalized older US adults (ages 65+) from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-18). Overall LE8 scores (range 0-100; higher is better cardiovascular health) were calculated for all participants. CVD diagnoses were self-reported, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction. Percent change in LE8 scores from 2013 to 2018 was calculated for each diagnosis group, and a linear regression tested for significance of changes within groups. The 3050 participants represented 37 908 305 US adults (54.7% women; mean age 72.6). LE8 scores tended to stay stable or decline between 2013 to 2014 and 2017 to 2018 for those with and without CVD. Significant decreases in mean LE8 scores occurred in those with hypertension, with a 4.1% decline (from 59.6 to 57.1 [P<0.01]); stroke, with an 11.5% decline (from 60.6 to 53.6 [P=0.01]); and heart failure, with a 15.2% decline (from 60.9 to 51.6 [P<0.001]). LE8 scores remained stable or declined for older US adults before the COVID-19 pandemic. Populations with hypertension, stroke, and heart failure had significant LE8 score declines.

    "abstract": "Increasing knowledge of the components involved in left ventricle (LV) remodelling and fibrotic processes after a myocardial infarction is crucial to understanding heart pathology. We have here analysed collagen XV (ColXV) expression in human myocardial infarct samples and assessed how its deficiency affects cardiac responses, such as fibrogenesis and tissue stiffness, after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in mice. We first observed high ColXV expression in human infarction scars. After ligating the left anterior descending artery in mice, cardiac function and remodelling were monitored by echocardiography, elasticity assessment, immunohistochemical analysis and ultrastructural assessments. After AMI, Col15a1-/- mice showed significantly increased tissue stiffness and upregulation of fibrosis-related genes in the remote myocardium. Striking differences were observed between the genotypes in the scar ultrastructure, protein compositions, cardiomyocyte morphology and intracellular architecture. Furthermore, the proportion of immature collagen fibres in the infarct border zone increased in Col15a1-/- mice, suggesting fragility and poor scar resistance to mechanical stress. Structural parameters indicated more substantial LV remodelling in the knockout mice, leading to a more dilated ventricle. Functionally, the ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased significantly in Col15a1-/- mice, indicating impaired heart contractile capacity. The results show that in the event of an AMI, ColXV plays an essential role in sustaining cardiac structure and function. In the absence of ColXV, dysregulated remodelling results in disrupted scar and infarct border zone, and stiffer left ventricle. These changes lead to a more severe cardiac phenotype and may affect long-term survival after AMI.",

In Thailand, the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), Social Health Insurance (SHI) and Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) have different provider choice and reimbursement arrangements and cover different populations. We explored to what extent use of revascularisation in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) varied by insurance scheme. We used claims data, including all admissions for patients with STEMI between 2015 and 2020. Outcomes were any type of revascularisation, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and mortality. Regression models were used to estimate absolute differences (ADs) by scheme, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and admission year. Of 98 142 patients, 75.7% were covered by UCS, 13.3% by CSMBS and 11.0% by SHI. Overall, 76.3% underwent revascularisation and 53.8% received PPCI. Mortality rates were 13.2% in-hospital and 20.7% at 180 days. Compared with UCS, use of revascularisation was slightly higher with CSMBS and slightly lower with SHI (AD: CSMBS 1.3% (95% CI -0.2 to 2.8), SHI -0.8% (-2.6 to 1.0), p=0.0264) and use of PPCI was slightly higher with CSMBS and SHI (AD: CSMBS 2.4% (-0.3 to 5.2), SHI 5.2% (3.1 to 7.2), p<0.0001)). CSMBS and SHI-insured patients had lower mortality compared with UCS (AD for in-hospital: CSMBS -1.3% (-2.1 to -0.5), SHI -0.9% (-1.8 to -0.1), p<0.0001; AD for 180-day mortality: CSMBS -4.5% (-5.3 to -3.6), SHI -1.9% (-3.0 to -0.8), p<0.0001). Effects of insurance scheme varied by hospital type for all outcomes (p for interaction<0.0001). Three-quarters of patients with STEMI received coronary revascularisation, suggesting potential undertreatment. We identified relatively small differences in access to revascularisation by insurance scheme which are unlikely to explain the lower mortality with CSMBS and SHI. Claims data can be used to assess the impact of insurance on access to effective treatments.",

This examination sought to methodically examine cardiovascular sequelae, notably heart failure, among users of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors when compared with nonusers. Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed databases, which compared the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and reported cardiovascular outcomes and heart failure events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), were searched using specific terms. Studies were included if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: they were randomized trials comparing DPP-4 inhibitor use in patients with T2DM; study duration was longer than 24 weeks; and they reported cardiovascular outcomes as their main or secondary end points. Stata 15 MP (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to analyze the data, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were used to represent the results. A total of 79,010 participants with T2DM were included. A total of 37,895 patients were assigned to the DPP-4 inhibitor group, whereas 41,115 patients were assigned to the control group. Results of the analysis showed that during a mean follow-up period ranging from 24 to 302 weeks, heart failure incidence did not differ significantly between T2DM patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors and those who were not (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.18; P = 0.452). Major adverse cardiovascular events (including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death; OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.08; P = 0.354), stroke (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.78-1.30; P = 0.968), myocardial infarction (OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73-1.07; P = 0.49), and all-cause mortality (OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96-1.11; P = 0.309) were also similarly manifested in both groups. The present analysis showed that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors did not significantly increase cardiovascular outcomes and heart failure in these patients with T2DM, indicating that these drugs may be safe to use in terms of cardiovascular events.",

Large-scale, real-world evidence of their broader clinical impact is needed. We assessed the phenome-wide risks and benefits of new users of GLP-1RA versus sulfonylureas, SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), and DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in adults with T2D in a multi- healthcare center, 1:1 high-dimensional propensity score matched new user cohort study utilizing principles of target trial emulation with electronic health records (EHRs) of over 9 million patients followed up to 730 days. Primary outcomes included 239 clinical endpoints across 14 organ systems. Among 86,790 patients, mean age was 58-66 years and 44-62% were female across cohorts. Compared to DPP-4i, GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (sHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.85) and chronic kidney disease (sHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.81). Compared to sulfonylurea, GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced acute renal failure risk (sHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.90). GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced heart failure risk compared to SGLT-2i (sHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.80). GLP-1RA also was associated with lower epilepsy risk versus DPP-4i (sHR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.76). GLP1RA was associated with elevated risks of nausea/vomiting: sHR 1.37 vs SGLT2i, 95% CI 1.15-1.62; sHR 1.46 vs sulfonylureas, 95% CI 1.24-1.71). Head-to-head real-world comparisons with established T2D therapies confirmed the broad cardiorenal and metabolic benefits and known on-target adverse effects of GLP-1RAs -consistent with randomized clinical trials - but also suggest potential risks for musculoskeletal and genitourinary adverse events, warranting continued real-world post-market surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) target vessels is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet its prevalence and prognostic implications remain poorly characterized. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of CMD in post-PCI target vessels and its associated clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies using quantitative coronary physiological assessments to evaluate CMD in post-PCI target vessels. Databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to January 2025. The pooled Prevalence, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for clinical outcomes were calculated using random-effects models. A total of 21 observational studies involving 6,632 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of CMD in post-PCI target vessels was 41.66% (95% CI: 34.18%-49.34%). Subgroup analyses revealed numerical variations in CMD prevalence across assessment methods, sex, clinical diagnoses, and target vessels, though intergroup differences did not reach statistical significance (all P > 0.05). The pooled prevalence of CMD was numerically higher in females (46.22% vs. 36.73% in males), patients with acute coronary syndrome (42.37% vs. 36.04% in chronic coronary syndrome), and those assessed via non-wire-based methods (44.72% vs. 35.65% in wire-based methods). CMD prevalence was comparable across target vessels (left anterior descending artery: 37.34%, left circumflex artery: 38.50%, right coronary artery: 39.09%). Patients with post-PCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade ≤2 exhibited higher CMD prevalence than those with TIMI flow grade 3, with a statistically significant difference (75.36% vs. 37.26%, P = 0.0012). CMD in post-PCI target vessels was independently associated with a 3.10-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (95% CI: 2.06-4.67) and a 4.66-fold risk of cardiac death or heart failure readmission (95% CI: 3.13-6.93). CMD in post-PCI target vessels is prevalent (approximately 40%) and independently associated with a elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

    "abstract": "Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, and is primarily mediated by gasdermin proteins and inflammatory caspases. Recent advances highlight the central role of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis and progression of a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Activation of inflammasomes and the subsequent cleavage of gasdermins drive cell membrane pore formation, leading to the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and other pro-inflammatory mediators, amplifying tissue injury and sterile inflammation. Both experimental and clinical evidence reveal that targeting key molecules in the pyroptotic pathway, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1, and gasdermin D, can attenuate myocardial injury, inhibit adverse cardiac remodeling, and stabilise atherosclerotic plaques. This review systematically summarises the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis in cardiovascular pathology, details its disease-specific roles, and discusses translational and therapeutic perspectives. Modulating pyroptosis may provide new opportunities for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

The patient underwent emergency surgical intervention. The postoperative period was complicated by a clinic of acute respiratory failure and bilateral pneumonia. In five days after surgery, the patient developed laboratory and instrumental signs of acute myocardial infarction. Changes similar to myocardial infarction appeared on electrocardiogram (ECG). Echocardiography revealed akinesis of the apical segments of the left ventricle and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was reduced (LVEF) from 63 to 31%-35%. The level of NT-proBNP has increased significantly, but the level of troponin I increased to a lesser extent. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal arteries without any obstruction. As a result, a diagnosis Takotsubo cardiomyopathy caused by acute surgical pathology was made. In the future, the patient was discharged in a stable state. Subsequent echocardiography showed normalization of the systolic function of the left ventricle, the disappearance of ECG changes, and a decrease in the level of specific cardiomarkers.",

Living systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Medline, Embase, Central, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2020 to 17 January 2024. Studies validating prognostic models that predicted all cause and cardiovascular mortality, admission to hospital for heart failure, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including people with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, or both. Risk models evaluating composite outcomes were not eligible. For each model and outcome, using a random effects model, the reported discrimination measures were pooled, reported as c statistics. Furthermore, when available, calibration plots were reconstructed and interpreted narratively. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment (PROBAST) tool was used to assess the risk of bias of each analysed study cohort and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to evaluate our certainty in the evidence. 6529 publications were identified, of which 35 studies reporting on 13 models were included, all of which were developed for general populations with type 2 diabetes but no established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. Among the identified models, the Risk Equations for Complications of Type 2 Diabetes (RECODe) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (UKPDS-OM2) evaluated all outcomes except for admission to hospital for heart failure. Relative to a threshold c statistic of 0.7, RECODe had an acceptable discrimination for cardiovascular mortality (0.79, high certainty), probably has an acceptable discrimination for myocardial infarction (0.72, moderate certainty) and stroke (0.71, moderate certainty), and may have an acceptable discrimination for kidney failure (0.76, low certainty). High certainty evidence suggests that UKPDS-OM2 has unacceptable discrimination for myocardial infarction (0.64) and stroke (0.65). RECODe showed acceptable calibration for cardiovascular mortality (high certainty), myocardial infarction (high certainty), and kidney failure (moderate certainty) but had unacceptable calibration for stroke (moderate certainty). UKPDS-OM2 showed acceptable calibration for cardiovascular mortality (moderate certainty), stroke (moderate certainty), and kidney failure (low certainty), but may have unacceptable calibration for myocardial infarction (moderate certainty). 13 unique models were identified that evaluated cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Two models, RECODe and UKPDS-OM2, evaluated all outcomes except for admission to hospital for heart failure.

    "abstract": "Statin therapy effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thereby lowering the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular (CV) events. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed its impact on all-cause mortality, CV mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and CV hospitalization in adults with CV risk factors or established cardiovascular disease (CVD). A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central (2013-2024) included randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and retrospective studies. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, CV mortality, MACE, and CV hospitalization. A random-effects model was employed, with heterogeneity assessed using the I² statistic. Seven studies, comprising 506,813 patients (118,491 statin users and 388,322 non-users), with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, were included. Statin therapy significantly reduced all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.83, p<0.00001, I²=91%), and MACE (RR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.70-0.82, p<0.00001, I²=0%). The high heterogeneity observed in mortality outcomes likely reflects differences in study populations, statin types, and baseline risk profiles. A non-significant trend was observed toward CV mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-1.02, p<0.00001, I²=90%). Additionally, no significant reduction in CV hospitalizations was observed (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83-1.13, p=0.58, I²=0%). Statin therapy significantly lowers all-cause mortality and MACE, reinforcing its role in CV risk management.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and underrecognized cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly in young and middle-aged women without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. While most cases heal spontaneously, a subset may persist, evolving into what can be considered a chronic coronary artery dissection (CCAD). This chronic form remains poorly defined and rarely documented.  A 44-year-old woman with a history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presented several months later with recurrent chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed a persistent dissection in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery without signs of active ischemia or evolving intramural hematoma. No advanced imaging was performed, but the stability of angiographic findings over time and the absence of ischemic symptoms supported the diagnosis of a chronic dissection. The initial STEMI was retrospectively considered to have resulted from an unrecognized SCAD. Given the lack of ischemia and the risks associated with intervention in SCAD, conservative management was continued. The patient remained asymptomatic and free of major cardiac events over a 12-month follow-up period. Chronic dissection may be overlooked in patients with a history of SCAD. Although angiography remains the main diagnostic tool, it has limitations, and adjunctive imaging such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) may help confirm chronicity. Current understanding of the long-term course of SCAD, including recurrence risk and follow-up strategies, is still limited. CCAD should be considered in patients with recurrent chest pain and prior SCAD history. Further studies are needed to better define its prognosis, recurrence risk, and optimal monitoring strategies.",

The clinical applications of patch devices, however, face major limitations mainly due to the inadequate integration of typically nonvascular implanted grafts with the recipient heart muscle tissue, the lack of patient and damage specificity, and insufficient perfusion. Here we present a new generation of cardiac patch devices with customized geometry and vasculature to closely correspond to those of the recipient heart tissue, while providing in-situ imaging properties. Incorporation of multiple computed tomography (CT) contrast agents within hydrogel bioinks enabled longitudinal and quantitative tracking of patch scaffolds both in vitro, in static versus flow culture conditions, and ex vivo using photon-counting CT (PCCT). We also investigated the cardioprotective impact of the bioprinted vascular patch in a rat model of MI. PCCT distinguished the signal from multiple contrast agents to assess perfusion within the vascular patch in vitro, as well as the surgical location, integration and degradation of patch ex vivo. Results establish a novel approach for developing vascular cardiac patches with noninvasive imaging capabilities, addressing critical challenges in monitoring patch engraftment and function, as a powerful tool for advancing translational cardiac regenerative therapies and optimizing clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "An integrated machine learning (ML) approach capable of both diagnosing acute coronary syndrome (ACS, encompassing myocardial infarction and unstable angina) and predicting future ACS risk within defined optimal timeframes remains an unmet need in cardiovascular risk stratification. We conducted a multicentre cohort study in China between January 2012 and December 2021. The derivation cohort (cohort 1+ cohort 2), consisting of a training, validation, and independent external test set, retrospectively included 1854 patients from four hospitals who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and received a definitive diagnosis of ACS or chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) within 7 days. The diagnostic performance of five commonly used ML algorithms for identifying ACS culprit lesions was developed and compared within this cohort. After selecting the optimal ML model, its performance was further validated in a single-center prospective cohort (cohort 3) and a nested case-control cohort (cohort 4) from two multicenter prospective cohorts to assess its ability to predict future ACS risk stratification (≥30 days). The derivation cohort comprised 1854 participants, among whom 281 experienced new-onset ACS within 7 day. The single-centre prospective cohort included 563 participants, of whom 23 developed ACS during follow-up (median 60.0 months). The nested case-control cohort included 202 participants, of whom 43 developed ACS during follow-up (median 28.0 months). In the derivation cohort, the random forest (RF) model demonstrated the best diagnostic performance and robustness among the five ML algorithms for detecting ACS culprit lesions, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 across the training (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.82-0.89), validation (95% Cl: 0.80-0.90), and test sets (95% Cl: 0.78-0.92). In two prospective cohorts, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the RF model successfully stratified the risk of future ACS events (both log-rank P < 0.001). The time-dependent AUC curve further indicated that the optimal validity period for the RF model derived from the culprit lesion was 2 years. The model's ability to distinguish ACS events within this period was superior to that of the stenosis severity model (AUC: Cohort 3: 0.79 [95% Cl: 0.66-0.93] vs. 0.67 [95% Cl: 0.52-0.82], P = 0.02; Cohort 4: 0.67 [95% Cl: 0.56-0.77] vs. 0.60 [95% Cl: 0.52-0.68], P = 0.05). Additionally, the RF model showed a significant improvement in performance compared to the stenosis severity model in both Cohorts 3 and 4 (all net reclassification improvement [NRI] values > 0). The ACS culprit lesion model developed using RF algorithms demonstrated superior diagnostic performance and was effective for short-term (2-year) ACS risk stratification.

This prospective observational study was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Pune, from February 2023 to July 2025. Twenty patients with cardiac masses identified on echocardiography underwent 3T CMR. Data collected included demographic details, clinical profiles, CMR findings, and comparative analysis with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Thrombi were the most common mass (50%), followed by myxomas (20%). Masses most frequently involved the left ventricle and right atrium. Most masses were ill-defined and T1 hypointense. CMR identified pericardial effusion and myocardial infarction in 20% each. Agreement between 2D echo and CMR was moderate. 3T CMR is a valuable imaging modality in evaluating cardiac masses, providing comprehensive tissue characterization and detection of associated findings that impact management.

This individual patient data meta-analysis focused on trials where FFR was used to assess intermediate coronary lesions in chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) or non-culprit vessels in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Randomized controlled trials comparing FFR- vs angiography-guided PCI with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were searched. Studies lacking angiographic inclusion criteria or using FFR for culprit arteries in NSTE-ACS were excluded. Studies including patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or undergoing surgical revascularization could be included after censoring these two subgroups. The primary outcome was the 1-year rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, MI, and repeat revascularization. The secondary outcomes were a composite of all-cause death and MI, the individual components of the primary outcome, cardiac death, spontaneous MI, and procedural MI. The present study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024553676). Five RCTs were selected, including 2493 patients: 1241 in the angiography arm and 1252 in the FFR arm. More vessels underwent PCI in the angiography group (45.1% vs 30.2%, P < .001), with more stents implanted per patient [2.0 (2.0-3.0) vs 1.5 (1.0-2.0), P < .001]. One-year MACE occurred in 14.7% of patients in the angiography group and 12.1% in the FFR group [hazard ratio (HR) .80, 95% confidence interval (CI) .64-.99; P = .046]. The risk of MI was significantly reduced in the FFR-guided group (HR .71, 95% CI .53-.96; P = .031). These outcomes were driven by a reduction in peri-procedural MI with FFR guidance, with no significant difference between groups in non-procedural MI, MACE between 30 days and 1 year, and secondary outcomes. Fractional flow reserve-guided PCI was associated with reduced major adverse events in patients with CCS and NSTE-ACS due mainly to fewer peri-procedural MIs, with no differences in mortality or MACE beyond 30 days.",

We sought to examine the hemorrhage risk with combining single (SAPT) or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with anticoagulants in patients with AIS with concomitant atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial infarction. This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study used TriNetX to collect data from 76 hospitals in the United States. Adult patients with diagnoses of AIS, atrial fibrillation, and acute myocardial infarction were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Propensity score-matched analysis, compared the odds for acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding at 3 months, 12 months, and throughout follow-up within TriNetX, among 3 matched subcohorts: anticoagulant alone, anticoagulant plus SAPT, and anticoagulant plus DAPT. Among 144 434 patients with AIS, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction (mean age, 71.9 years; 43.3% women), 8772 (6.1%) patients received anticoagulants alone, 88 430 (61.2%) received anticoagulant plus SAPT, and 47 232 (32.7%) received anticoagulants plus DAPT. After propensity score matching, 8706 patients were included in each subcohort. Compared with anticoagulant alone, anticoagulant plus SAPT and anticoagulant plus DAPT showed no significant increase in intracerebral hemorrhage risk at 3 and 12 months but increased long-term risk (odds ratio for anticoagulant plus SAPT, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.11-1.44], P<0.001; for anticoagulant plus DAPT, odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.18-1.53]; P<0.001). Gastrointestinal bleeding risk was elevated at all time points with combination therapies. Combining antiplatelets with anticoagulants after AIS may be associated an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in the long term, particularly beyond 12 months, but with an increased risk of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the short and long term. Larger prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.",

Significant reductions were also detected in all-cause mortality (10.0% versus 13.7%; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99]; I2=58%), hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (14.6% versus 32.5%; RR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.39-0.58]; I2=26%), and stroke (4.5% versus 7.2% RR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.40-0.95]; I2=0%). No significant difference was observed in cardiac-specific mortality (8.3% versus 16% RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.40-1.16]; I2=65%) and myocardial infarction (0.6% versus 4.6%; RR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.04-1.19]; I2=0%). Our meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that among patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, a strategy of early aortic valve interventions was superior to conservative treatments in reducing the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, stroke, and myocardial infarction. However, significant differences in the rates of cardiac-specific mortality were not apparent.",

    "abstract": "The combination of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has become a widely used approach for resuscitating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiac arrest (CA). Nonetheless, limited research has focused on predicting in-hospital mortality in affected patients. This study aims to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality and develop a clinical prediction model for these patients. Clinical presentations of AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO at two hospitals in Zhengzhou were evaluated. Patients were stratified based on their survival status at discharge. A comprehensive analysis, which included univariate logistic regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate logistic regression, was conducted to identify predictors and develop a nomogram for in-hospital mortality. The nomogram's predictive performance was subsequently compared to that of existing models. The study included 139 patients, of whom 84 died during hospitalization. Using factors such as age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid levels, and serum creatinine, a nomogram model was developed. The model demonstrated good predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.826 (95% CI 0.757-0.894) in the training dataset and 0.783 (95% CI 0.706-0.859) in the internal validation dataset, indicating high accuracy and stability. Clinical decision curve analysis confirmed the model's utility, particularly for risk thresholds above 20%, outperforming existing models. This study identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO and developed a clinically applicable prediction model.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis arises from the abnormal activation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in response to both chemical and mechanical stressors. While extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is a key determinant of fibroblast behavior, the molecular mechanisms linking mechanical signals to gene expression remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel system that mimics the ECM stiffness of normal, mid-stage, and fibrotic myocardium. Using RNA sequencing, we identified mechanosensitive genes in CFs cultured within this system. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed a 98-gene cluster, encompassing PCSK6, ATP8B4, THBS2, and DCN, among others, which was significantly upregulated across stiffness gradients. Single-cell RNA sequencing from myocardial infarction and pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis models validated the mechanosensitivity of these genes, uncovering distinct temporal expression patterns under acute versus chronic mechanical stress. Notably, the marked upregulation of this gene cluster in human dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy samples underscores its clinical relevance. Functional assays confirmed the crucial roles of THBS2 and DCN in fibroblast activation. Collectively, our findings deepen the understanding of the mechanobiology underlying cardiac fibrosis and highlight potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for modulating mechanical stress in this pathological condition.",

    "abstract": "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been associated with prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, but data on its role in elderly individuals remains limited. This single-center, retrospective study included 590 elderly AMI patients, who were stratified into three groups based on hs-CRP tertiles. The incidence of adverse in-hospital events increased progressively across higher hs-CRP tertiles (17.2%, 25.5%, and 48%, P<0.001). Notably, patients who experienced these events had significantly higher hs-CRP levels compared to those without adverse outcomes (7.04 [2.38, 20.00] vs. 2.59 [1.06, 6.07], P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified hs-CRP as an independent predictor of in-hospital outcomes in elderly AMI patients (Q3: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.23-3.97, P=0.008). The area under the curve (AUC) for hs-CRP's predictive accuracy was 0.712 (95% CI 0.664-0.755, P<0.001). Furthermore, integrating hs-CRP into an established risk factor model significantly improved both reclassification and discrimination (Continuous NRI: 0.461, 95% CI 0.292-0.631, P<0.001; IDI: 0.046, 95% CI 0.025-0.067, P<0.001), although it did not substantially enhance the C-statistic (0.867 (95% CI 0.831-0.895, P<0.001) vs. 0.876 (95% CI 0.841-0.905, P<0.001) , P=0.183).

Cardiac biomarkers such as BNP, Troponin I, and NT-proBNP are early indicators of cardiovascular stress and subclinical damage. For instance, Troponin I is linked to myocardial infarction, while BNP and NT-proBNP are used to identify heart failure. This study examines the relationship between educational attainment of social network and cardiac biomarkers using data from the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (KSHAP), a longitudinal study of 709 adults aged 60-95 in a rural village, surveyed in 2011, 2016, and 2019. Fixed-effects models were employed to reduce unobserved heterogeneity by assessing within-individual changes. The educational attainment of rural older adults, who typically possess only basic education, showed no association with levels of cardiac biomarkers. However, compared to older adults with no college-educated friend, people with one college-educated friend-of-friend was linked to lower levels of BNP (β = - 0.26), Troponin I (β = - 0.81), and NT-proBNP (β = - 0.57).

This disparity is influenced by factors such as older age, greater comorbidity burden, atypical symptom presentation and delays in treatment. This study analysed patients with AMI (2003-2018) from the Lombardy Health Database (Italy) to examine sex differences in in-hospital and 1-year mortality and the role of age, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and postdischarge therapy. Among 263 564 patients with AMI (93 363 women, 170 201 men), primary and secondary endpoints were in-hospital and 1-year mortality, respectively. Path analysis evaluated the direct and indirect effects of sex on outcomes, incorporating age, PCI and postdischarge therapy as mediators. Women had higher in-hospital (10% vs 5%; p<0.0001) and 1-year mortality (24% vs 14%; p<0.0001) but were less likely to receive PCI (40% vs 61%; p<0.0001) and postdischarge therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy 53% vs 63%; ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 60% vs 64%; beta blockers 53% vs 61%; lipid-lowering drugs 45% vs 58%; p<0.0001 for all differences). After adjusting for age, major comorbidities, PCI and postdischarge treatment, mortality differences were no longer significant (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07 for in-hospital mortality) or even reversed (adjusted HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.96 for 1-year mortality). Path analysis showed that female sex directly contributed 12% to in-hospital mortality and 4% to 1-year mortality, while age and undertreatment accounted for most of the disparity (88% and 96%, respectively). Women with AMI face higher mortality largely due to older age and undertreatment during hospitalisation and after discharge. Addressing these gaps could improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Post-procedural three-dimensional (3D) quantitative coronary angiography (QCA)-based vessel fractional flow reserve (vFFR) has shown a strong correlation with invasive FFR measurements. However, the relationship between post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vFFR, vFFR-derived pressure pullback gradient (PPG), clinical outcomes, and post-PCI quality of life (QoL) concerning sex differences remains unexplored. This single-centre retrospective study included patients undergoing PCI for stable or unstable angina, or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with two angiographic views suitable for post-PCI vFFR calculation and complete QoL assessment. Post-PCI QoL was assessed using EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). Focal disease was defined as vFFR-derived PPG ≥0.74, diffuse as values <0.74. QoL and clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared between sexes. A total of 234 patients (286 vessels) were analyzed, with median follow-up of 4.21 years. The median post-PCI vFFR was 0.92 (IQR 0.90-0.95), and the median vFFR-derived PPG was 0.74 (IQR 0.65-0.84), with no significant differences between sexes. Among patients with high post-PCI vFFR (above the median of 0.92), females had lower EQ index score than males (p < 0.001). In the middle post-PCI vFFR tertile (vFFR between 0.88 and 0.93), females had lower SAQ Summary scores than males (p < 0.001). Females had significantly lower EQ Index and SAQ Summary scores compared to males among patients with both focal and diffuse disease, with all p-values <0.05. There were no differences in clinical outcomes between sexes. This finding suggests that vFFR may be associated with post-procedural QoL, which in our study was lower in women than in men-though inconsistently across instruments or domains-despite similar post-PCI vFFR and vFFR-derived PPG values, warranting confirmation in larger, prospective studies.",

This study aimed to explore the therapeutic mechanism of XST on STEMI by conducting a metabolomics analysis of plasma samples from 23 patients with STEMI. The patients were divided into a control group (13 patients) and an experimental group (10 patients), both undergoing emergency coronary intervention (PCI) and standardized drug therapy. The experimental group received XST for 7 days. The results demonstrated that XST can improve ventricular remodeling by modulating 71 different metabolites. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in several pathways, including caffeine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, as well as starch and sucrose metabolism. Further analysis suggested that the protective effect of XST on STEMI patients might be attributed to the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, and lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking technology confirmed that the main component of XST has high binding activity and stable docking conformation with key targets for treating STEMI. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the therapeutic potential of XST for treating STEMI.",

The immune system can recognize oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) and create antibodies with pro- or antithrombotic properties. This study aimed to elucidate the role of natural antibodies against OSEs in patients on hemodialysis (HD) and their association with cardiovascular outcomes. Serum levels of IgM and IgG autoantibodies to OSEs (including CuOx-LDL, MDA-LDL, and MAA-BSA) were measured using an ELISA assay in a prospective population-based cohort study of prevalent HD patients. The risk for the occurrence of the 3P-MACE outcome (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death) with the association of antibodies against OSEs was statistically analyzed in a competing risk framework. In our study of 595 patients with ESKD (236 (37 %) women, median age: 67 (25th to 75th percentile 55-75) years); 54 patients were long-term survivors (>10 years on HD). There was no association between IgM and IgG antibodies to OSEs with the risk of 3P-MACE occurrence after adjusting for age, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and coronary heart disease. However, long-term survivors on HD, exhibited higher levels of antibodies to OSEs compared to other patients and lower risk of 3P-MACE (IgG MAA-BSA median 97,663.83 in long-term survivors versus 70,833.50 RLU rest of the cohort, p = 0.001). Natural autoantibodies against OSEs were not associated with the overall risk of 3P-MACE in this cohort of HD patients.

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent chronic condition with increasing incidence worldwide. AF increases the risks of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction and imposes a substantial burden on the health care system. Cardiac rehabilitation programs, while effective, often have low patient adherence. Recent evidence suggests that cardiac telerehabilitation, where patients are given home monitoring devices, could enhance adherence and outcomes. The program \"Future Patient-Telerehabilitation of Patients with AF\" (FP-AF) was created to assess the effects and potential benefits of cardiac telerehabilitation on patients with AF. The objective of this study is to explore the experiences of patients participating in the FP-AF program. This qualitative sub-study is part of the multicenter, randomized controlled FP-AF trial, which included 208 patients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 14 patients, randomly selected from participants in the intervention arm of the FP-AF program. The patient interviews, guided by self-determination theory, focused on patients' experiences with the FP-AF program, including the use of telerehabilitation technologies and a web-based portal called the \"HeartPortal.\" Interview responses were analyzed using NVivo software (version 14.0; QSR International), with thematic coding based on interview guides and methodological guidance elaborated by Brinkmann & Kvale. The study adhered to ethical guidelines, with informed consent obtained from all participants. Based on the interviews, the following themes were identified: the home monitoring devices are viewed positively by the patients; the HeartPortal is a useful digital toolbox; patients develop new coping strategies for living with AF; the measured values are useful for the patients; the community of practice is beneficial; and the FP-AF program creates a sense of security. Participation in the FP-AF program enhanced patients' sense of security, empowerment, and knowledge about AF. This improvement was due largely to a combination of patients' use of the HeartPortal and the educational sessions at health care centers. Telerehabilitation for patients with AF may be a useful way of researching this group of patients with a focus on rehabilitation and may be an effective means of offering rehabilitation to this group in the future.",

Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality (primary), cardiac mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), recurrent myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization (TVR), stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Random effects models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fourteen studies (43 547 patients) met inclusion criteria; nine studies reported all-cause mortality.

We examined the association of SA with survival and the incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack(TIA) in Medicare beneficiaries with AF undergoing AVR. Medicare claims(2008-2019) were queried to identify patients with AF undergoing AVR; procedural characteristics were doubly-adjudicated using hospital and surgeon billing codes. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were generated for beneficiaries who did and did not receive concomitant SA. 10-year restricted mean survival times(RMST) were compared; 95% confidence intervals are provided. Outcomes were re-analyzed using surgeon frequency of SA as an instrumental variable. Overlap propensity score weighting was performed for risk-adjustment in all analyses.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the FIB-4 score, independent of its role in liver assessment, can predict short-term mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) in the emergency department (ED). In this prospective observational study, 1017 patients diagnosed with AMI and treated with CAG between May 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024, were included. Patients were stratified into three groups based on FIB-4 score: low (< 1.45), intermediate (1.45-3.25), and high (> 3.25). Clinical and laboratory data, HEART scores, angiographic findings, in-hospital and 30-day outcomes were compared across groups. Patients with FIB-4 > 3.25 exhibited significantly higher rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (60.2%), hypertension (64%), diabetes mellitus (47.5%), atrial fibrillation (11%), and ventricular tachycardia (2.1%) (all p < 0.01).

ROC analysis revealed moderate discriminative performance for FIB-4 (AUC: 0.693) and HEART score (AUC: 0.766). Elevated FIB-4 scores are independently associated with increased short-term mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in AMI patients undergoing CAG.

The average age of patients was 59.0 years and 52.7% were women. The incidence of 30-day MACE was 0.2%. Overall, in this cohort of patients with moderate or high HEART score, Hs-TnI below the 99th percentile had an NPV of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.6% - 100.0%) in ruling out MACE at 30 days. Given the low event rate, a moderate or high HEART score should not be the sole determinant for admission when Hs-Tnl is not elevated.",

    "abstract": "Pre-clinical studies have suggested the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia in cardiogenic shock (CS). However, current evidence on its efficacy and safety in CS remains limited. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess efficacy/safety of hypothermia in CS. PUBMED/EMBASE/Cochrane/Scopus/Web of Science were searched from inception to December 31, 2024, for studies evaluating outcomes of hypothermia in CS. Efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes included pneumonia, sepsis, and bleeding. Seven studies including 695 patients were analyzed. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)-related CS was the primary etiology in 363 patients (52.2%). Hypothermia was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 30 days (OR 0.83 [0.54-1.26] or at the longest available follow-up (IRR 0.85 [0.72-1.01]). No significant differences were observed for pneumonia (OR 1.44 [0.42-4.87]), sepsis (OR 0.61 [0.01-46.80]), or bleeding (OR 1.36 [0.65-2.89]). Meta-regression suggested that hypothermia may be less beneficial and riskier in patients with AMI-CS, whereas greater benefit was observed in those with mechanical circulatory support. Trial sequential analysis indicated that the cumulative Z-curve for hypothermia did not cross the boundary for benefit, nor the futility boundary, suggesting that current evidence remains inconclusive and underpowered. In this meta-analysis, therapeutic hypothermia appeared safe but failed to show a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with CS, albeit with very low certainty of evidence. Larger RCTs are warranted to clarify its clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Wire-based indices of coronary physiology are the gold standard for guiding revascularisation decisions in patients with coronary artery disease and angiographically intermediate coronary stenoses. FFRangio is a novel angiography-based technology for assessing the functional significance of epicardial coronary stenoses without pressure wires or hyperaemic stimulus. The primary objective of the Advancing Cath Lab Results with FFRangio Coronary Physiology Assessment trial (ALL-RISE; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05893498) is to compare clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndromes or non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes undergoing coronary angiography with ≥1 coronary lesion suitable for physiological assessment. Patients will be randomised to FFRangio-guided or to pressure wire-guided treatment. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year (a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned clinically driven revascularisation), assessed for non-inferiority of FFRangio-based versus pressure wire-based guidance. If non-inferiority is met, reflex superiority guidance will be tested. Secondary endpoints include periprocedural and early complications up to 30 days, individual components of MACE at 1 year, patient-reported health status, procedural resource utilisation and healthcare-related costs, and operator-assessed usability of the FFRangio and pressure wire systems. With a sample size of 1,924 patients, the study has 82.7% power to assess non-inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of 3.5%. The ALL-RISE trial will provide prospective clinical outcomes data on the relative safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a workflow using FFRangio as compared with pressure wire-based approaches for coronary lesion assessment among patients being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention.",

The MI expression microarrays GSE48060 and GSE66360 were retrieved and downloaded from the GEO database. The merged expression data were subjected to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed in MI. Primary rat cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) were isolated for an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, in which the effect of ICAM1, NFIL3, TULP2, and ZFP36 on cell phenotype experiments was detected. Gene differential expression analysis identified 96 significant DEGs, and the intersection of these genes with the module genes obtained from WGCNA analysis yielded 81 candidate genes. LASSO regression and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms identified 7 candidate diagnostic genes. ICAM1, NFIL3, TULP2, and ZFP36 exhibited good diagnostic potential in both experimental and validation datasets, showing significant correlations with immune cells, including Neutrophils. ICAM1, NFIL3, TULP2, and ZFP36 were markedly up-regulated in OGD/R-treated NRVMs, while ICAM1 knockdown suppressed NRVM damage triggered by OGD/R. ICAM1, NFIL3, TULP2, and ZFP36 can serve as candidate diagnostic genes for MI, and ICAM1 silencing can ameliorate OGD/R-elicited myocardial cell damage.",

Patients presenting with suspected MI without ST elevation to a tertiary center were enrolled. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by two cardiologists. Trained cardiology fellows conducted and interpreted bedside echocardiography in the emergency department as standard of care. Diagnostic performance measures (negative and positive predictive values [NPV, PPV] [95% confidence intervals]) to rule-in or rule-out MI were compared for patients with and without any pathological finding (any wall-motion abnormalities [WMA] or systolic left ventricular dysfunction) in patients assigned to the observe group by a 0/1-hs-cTnI-algorithm. Cox regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of pathological findings with all-cause death. Overall, 2779 patients with available echocardiography were included (median age 63 years, 366 [13.2%] with MI, 2158 [77.6%] with data on WMA, median follow-up 5.2 years).

    "title": "Mitochondrial Transplantation Augments the Reparative Capacity of Macrophages Following Myocardial Injury.",
    "abstract": "The pathologically remodeled myocardial ischemic microenvironment, characterized by sustained hypoxia, metabolic insufficiency, and accumulation of inflammatory mediators, severely disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis. This dysfunction establishes a self-perpetuating cycle that impairs the coordinated healing cascade and compromises cardiac tissue repair following myocardial infarction (MI). To counteract these effects, a novel strategy of mitochondrial augmentation is proposed, whereby healthy exogenous mitochondria are introduced into macrophages to generate mitochondria-transplanted macrophages (Mito-T-Macros or MTMs), which can resist post-MI stress. Mitochondrial transplantation (MT) effectively induces macrophage polarization toward a reparative M2-like phenotype, thereby enhancing pro-healing functions, including migration, invasion, and phagocytosis. In vivo, MTM therapy enhances cardiac function after MI and attenuates left ventricular remodeling by reducing fibrosis, limiting apoptosis, and promoting angiogenesis. Mechanistically, MT accelerates the phenotypic transition of macrophages to a reparative state and prolongs their activity during the healing phase. Notably, a portion of the transplanted mitochondria are released from MTMs and subsequently internalized by cardiomyocytes, suggesting an additional mechanism of myocardial support. Overall, MT enhances the reparative capabilities of macrophages and contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of MTMs in ameliorating post-MI cardiac remodeling. These findings support MTM therapy as a promising and innovative approach for repairing myocardial injury following MI.",

Cardiac catheterization revealed a left anterior descending (LAD) artery aneurysm with 99% stenosis, necessitating urgent stenting.

The patient was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy, heparin, and blood pressure control. After stabilization and discharge, she maintained regular follow-up with her primary care physician to discuss secondary prevention of further cardiovascular adverse events. Postpartum ACS, especially secondary to coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), is exceedingly rare but highlights the importance of cardiovascular monitoring in patients with a history of preeclampsia.

This study aimed to identify the most effective anthropometric indicators that add predictive value to body mass index (BMI) for subsequent CV events in individuals without carotid plaques, improving early risk stratification in subclinical populations. This longitudinal study enrolled 1043 participants from a community-based cohort in Shanghai (2013-2014) and followed them for CV events through 2021-2022. The CV events included ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, hospitalization for heart failure, and coronary revascularization), ischemic stroke, and CV death. Carotid plaque was excluded via ultrasound. Visceral fat area (VFA) was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The neck circumference (NC), neck-to-height ratio (NHtR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), neck-to-limb length ratio (NLR), and waist-to-limb length ratios (WLR) were calculated. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between various obesity-related indices (BMI, waist circumference, NC, NHtR, WHtR, WHR, NLR, and WLR) and VFA (all P < 0.001). Over a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years, 97 CV events (9.3%) were recorded. Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that elevated NLR was significantly associated with an increased CV risk with hazard ratios of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.52). Notably, the NLR significantly improved the predictive capacity of CV events (C-statistic, 0.671 [95% CI: 0.616-0.726], P = 0.002; NRI, 0.090 [95% CI: 0.003-0.177], P < 0.001; IDI, 0.007 [95% CI: 0.000-0.019], P < 0.001).

We aim to evaluate whether high-intensity statins are associated with lower PCAT attenuation in this high-risk cohort. We retrospectively analysed 203 CCTAs performed at our institution between 1/1/2019 and 9/1/2024 in patients with T2DM who met these key criteria: evidence of coronary atherosclerosis on CCTA, treatment with ≥1 oral hypoglycaemic agent, and no history of prior coronary interventions. PCAT attenuation was measured in the proximal right coronary artery. Among the three statin intensity groups, patients receiving high-intensity statins (n = 75) had the lowest PCAT attenuation (high-intensity: -75.0 ± 6.8 HU, moderate-intensity: -71.8 ± 8.2 HU, no statin: -71.6 ± 7.4 HU; adjusted p = 0.027). In addition to high-intensity statins, treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist was independently associated with a lower likelihood of having elevated PCAT attenuation (≥ -70.5 HU), with an odds ratio of 0.344 (95% CI: 0.132-0.900).

A total of 207 carotid endarterectomy patients were evaluated, comparing the conventional carotid endarterectomy (C-CEA) technique with the eversion carotid endarterectomy (E-CEA) technique. Patch utilization rates, cross-clamping, and operation times were evaluated and compared, along with mortality and morbidity outcomes, including postoperative cerebrovascular events, death, myocardial infarction, and peripheral nerve injury. Preoperative demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Perioperative cross-clamp and operation times were significantly shorter in the E-CEA group. Additionally, no patch was used in any patient in the E-CEA group, contributing to shorter operation times and eliminating the need for an additional incision for the saphenous patch. Eversion carotid endarterectomy yields similar outcomes to conventional carotid endarterectomy in terms of stroke, mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction, and local nerve injury. However, E-CEA demonstrated statistical superiority in operation and cross-clamp times, and the need for patching. Although randomized prospective studies with larger patient populations are necessary for more definitive conclusions, E-CEA appears to be a safe and effective alternative to C-CEA.",

This single-center study was a retrospective cohort analysis of all STEMI patients consecutively referred to Farshchian Hospital (Hamadan Province-Iran) from April 2021 to August 2024. Four different feature selection methods were used to select common important variables in the prediction model: Boruta, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Random Forest (RF) and LASSO. The uneven distribution of the different classes 2,356 (91.7%) alive and 212 (8.3%) dead) was dealt with using the SMOTE method. After splitting the data into a training (70%) and a test (30%) dataset, a multiple logistic regression model was formulated using the significant variables identified. A nomogram predicting in-hospital mortality was then constructed and validated.

    "abstract": "Heart attack is one of the most common heart diseases, which causes more deaths worldwide. Early detection and continuous monitoring are essential in reducing the death rate caused by heart diseases. Machine learning gives a promising solution for early and accurate heart disease detection by analyzing the data from healthcare devices. Although existing studies have employed various machine learning techniques to detect heart disease, most of the techniques still face challenges in handling large healthcare datasets that affect the prediction outcomes. To solve this issue, the research work focuses on developing a novel framework for detecting heart disease in its early stages by using machine learning techniques. In the initial phase, the significant data required for the validation is collected from benchmark resources, and it is subjected to the weighted optimal features selection phase. Here, from the input data, the features are selected optimally and their weights are tuned using Enhanced Arbitrary Variable-based Ship Rescue Optimization (EAVSRO). Further, the optimally selected weighted features are fed into the detection phase. In this phase, an Adaptive Deep Support Vector Machine (AD-SVM) is employed to detect heart diseases. Once heart disease is detected, the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) rate is determined using the Adaptive Multiscale Convolution Capsule Network (AMCCNet). Finally, the AF rate is obtained from the developed AMCCNet, and its parameters are tuned using the same EAVSRO. Later, various experiments are performed in the recommended heart disease detection model over existing models to verify its effectiveness. The accuracy of the designed framework is 96.07%, which is enhanced than the other existing frameworks like CNN-LSTM, DCNN, Adaboost and SVM, respectively. Thus, the results proved that the developed model can effectively detect heart disease at the early stages and identify the AF rate, providing timely treatments.",

The utilization of deep sequencing-based transcriptome profiling methodologies has yielded empirical support for the notion that the transcriptional activity of the human genome is more expansive than previously postulated. Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous collection of noncoding transcripts with a length exceeding 200 nucleotides. Transposable elements represent a significant proportion of the human genome, and their potential contribution could be as high as 90%. LncRNAs can exert control over several biological processes through their ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of coding genes, engage in direct protein interactions, and potentially encode proteins. lncRNAs have been acknowledged as significant factors in the causation and progression of myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and other pathological processes that have a considerable influence on the prognosis and survival of individuals afflicted with CVD. Moreover, the observable patterns of expression demonstrated by lncRNAs in different CVD scenarios greatly augment their potential as biomarkers and targets for intervention. To lay a strong foundation for future research on the mitigation and management of CVDs, we comprehensively examine current scholarly literature on lncRNAs in the context of cardiovascular disorders. The discourse also involves the potential usefulness of lncRNAs as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic injury and reperfusion injury collectively determine the total infarct size, a major prognostic factor following myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, addressing both ischemic and reperfusion stages could substantially reduce infarct size and improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we develop a two-component therapeutic system from different parts of Glycyrrhiza: a functional hydrogel made from glycyrrhizic acid extracted from the stem and root, and nanosized chloroplast units (NCUs) derived from leaves. The hydrogel demonstrates therapeutic effects during both hypoxia and reoxygenation stages in vitro, while the photosynthetic NCUs alleviate hypoxia injury by providing ATP and NADPH under illumination. Subsequent in vivo study reveals the most significant therapeutic effect in the combination group (NCU plus hydrogel), which effectively treats both ischemic and reperfusion stages. Our study highlights the cross-species application of plant photosynthetic mechanisms in MI treatment and confirms that simultaneous treatment of ischemia and reperfusion is more effective than treating either stage alone, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for MI.",

    "title": "Development of a miniaturized chemiluminescence lateral flow immunoassay platform with ultra-high sensitivity and ultra-low background for cardiac troponin I.",
    "abstract": "Lateral flow immunoassays (LFA) are widely used for disease diagnostics due to their simplicity and portability. However, they often suffer from limited sensitivity and accuracy, making them unsuitable for quantitative detection. Additionally, the adsorption and non-specific interactions between label particles and the nitrocellulose membrane may lead to increased background noise, which compromises the repeatability of the device. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a highly sensitive, accurate, and high signal-to-noise ratio LFA device that is free from background noise interference. We developed a miniaturized LFA platform that achieves dual-enhanced colorimetric and chemiluminescence signals with ultra-low background noise for detecting cardiac troponin I. The enhancement is achieved through the sequential addition of horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (HRP-SA) and multiple layers of biotin-antibody (Bio-Ab) conjugated to gold nanoparticles. This conjugation alters the surface charge state of the particles, reducing nonspecific adsorption to the nitrocellulose membrane and significantly lowering background noise. Additionally, the multilayered Bio-Ab coatings and the robust interaction between streptavidin and biotin markedly increase antibody loading, further enhancing the device's sensitivity. A compact smartphone-based imaging setup combined with a high-resolution lens was used for signal readout. The assay strip demonstrated a colorimetric detection range of 100 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL and a chemiluminescent detection range of 10 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. This work establishes a new foundational methodology for chemiluminescence LFA, offering a simpler and more accessible approach that does not require complex equipment, making it ideal for the rapid and on-site diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. We firmly believe that this method holds great potential for widespread applications in sensitive, and rapid disease diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Optimal transfusion strategies for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are uncertain. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations for red blood cell transfusion in patients with AMI. These guidelines are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials of patients presenting with AMI and assigned to 2 different transfusion strategies (restrictive or liberal) based on hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit levels before receipt of a transfusion. A meta-analysis of eligible trials was performed using Cochrane methods. The international panel followed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to summarize evidence and formulate recommendations. This guideline's primary perspective is that of the patient, including medical, financial, and psychological effects, with secondary consideration of health care system issues, particularly conservation of the limited and costly blood supply. For hospitalized patients with AMI, the panel suggests a liberal red cell transfusion strategy when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 10 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). A restrictive strategy of 7 to 8 g/dL may result in increased mortality in patients with AMI. The direction of the recommendation for the liberal strategy was based on the great importance of mortality for patients. The conditional recommendation was based on the low certainty of evidence and the competing consideration of blood supply conservation. Clinicians should adopt mitigation strategies to reduce potential adverse events associated with a liberal transfusion strategy, and all transfusion decisions should incorporate the clinical context rather than solely the hemoglobin concentration.",

Retinal imaging in CKD provides a non-invasive opportunity for CV risk stratification through microvascular analysis. The objective of this study was to evaluate retinal vascular features extracted via computer vision and machine learning approaches for CV risk and their added value over established risk calculators in CKD patients. Retinal scans from 1333 participants of the multi-center clinical observational study, Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (NCT00304148), were analyzed. A deep-learning pipeline segmented vessels and then identified arterioles and venules from them. Segmented vessel, arteriole and venule masks were used to extract 384 vascular features. An elastic-net model-Cardiovascular Assessment through Retinal Evaluation in CKD (CARE-CKD)(MCARE)- was trained, using the top eight features, on 567 participants (101 major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]: composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and validated on 244 participants (44 MACE). A Nomogram integrating MCARE with clinical markers (age, sex, blood pressure, smoking, eGFR, albuminuria, cholesterol, BMI and diabetes status) was developed. MCARE demonstrated strong prognostic performance for predicting MACE, (C-index=0.70, HR=3.95, above vs. below median; 95%CI: 2.36-6.63; p<0.001), outperforming the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) (C-index=0.66; HR=1.06) (Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) p<0.01) and Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs (PREVENT) (C-index=0.65; HR=1.84, LRT p<0.001) calculators.

Nomogram enhanced risk stratification (C-index=0.77, HR=3.81, p<0.0001) compared to clinical markers (LRT p<0.01). CARE-CKD provides a novel, opportunistic approach to CV risk assessment in CKD, outperforming the established risk calculators and refining stratification within high-risk categories. By enabling earlier identification, close monitoring, and targeted management of high-risk patients, CARE-CKD addresses gaps left by traditional calculators, maximizing the benefits of emerging therapies and potentially improving long-term outcomes.",

We aimed to investigate the impact of alirocumab added to high-intensity statin therapy on neoatherosclerosis formation among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with DES. This was a pre-specified substudy of the PACMAN-AMI trial, a randomized, double-blind trial comparing alirocumab versus placebo added to high-intensity statin therapy in AMI patients. The present study included patients undergoing optical coherence tomography assessment of DES in the culprit lesion at one year. The frequency of neoatherosclerosis, neointimal thickness, and strut malapposition were compared between treatment groups. Among 191 patients (95 with alirocumab and 96 with placebo), neoatherosclerosis was observed in 13 patients (6.8%) at one year. There was no significant difference in the frequency of neoatherosclerosis between treatment groups (alirocumab 4.2% vs. placebo 9.4%, P = 0.25).

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) can present with AMI, but the subtype and prognosis are not fully understood. The study was conducted based on the APS cohort in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. According to coronary angiography, AMI patients were classified as MICAD or MINOCA. Thrombotic APS (tAPS) patients were enrolled to explore the risk factors of AMI. The study enrolled 36 APS-AMI patients, 26 (72%) patients with MICAD and 10 (28%) with MINOCA. 345 tAPS patients without coronary artery disease in APS cohort were selected as a control group. The risk factors of AMI were male, smoking history, anti-cardiolipin antibody (aCL), and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody (aβ2GPI). Secondary APS and aCL were more common in MINOCA (70% VS. 23.1%, P = 0.018; 100% (10/10) VS. 65.4%, P = 0.039), while previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was less common in MINOCA (0 VS. 50%, P = 0.006). MINOCA patients tended to receive immunosuppression and anticoagulation therapy, while 57.7% MICAD patients received revascularization. In total, 13 (36.1%) patients experienced AMI recurrence during a mean follow-up of 42.25 months, which only occurred in the MICAD group. Over 60% (8/13) had recurrence more than once. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be a possible protective factor for AMI recurrence (HR 0.106, P = 0.032). Male, smoking history, aCL, and aβ2GPI can be risk factors for AMI in APS patients. APS-MINOCA group had a significantly better prognosis. Hydroxychloroquine might prevent AMI recurrence. Key Points • Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were younger than typical AMI patients, and 45% were women. • The subtype, myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and myocardial infarction with coronary artery disease (MICAD), and prognosis of AMI in APS patients remains unknown. • MINOCA was associated with secondary APS and aCL, while MICAD with previous ASCVD. • MINOCA had a significantly better prognosis.

We aimed to integrate salivary microbiome and serum inflammatory mediator profiles with asthma attacks history to develop a comprehensive predictive model for future attacks. This study contained a discovery (SysPharmPediA) and a replication phase (U-BIOPRED). School-aged children with asthma were classified into at risk and no-risk groups, based on the presence or absence of one or more severe attacks during one-year follow-up. Prediction models were developed using random forest on the training set (70%) with data on past asthma attacks, microbiome composition, serum inflammatory mediator levels, and their combinations and then tested on the rest of the population (30%). Outcomes were replicated in a subset of children with severe asthma from U-BIOPRED. Complete data were available for 154 children (SysPharmPediA = 121, U-BIOPRED = 33). In discovery, the model based on past attacks resulted in an area under the receiving characteristic curve (AUROCC) ~ 0.7. Models including six salivary bacteria or six inflammatory mediators achieved similar results. The combined model incorporating seven features, past asthma attacks, Capnocytophaga, Corynebacterium, and Cardiobacterium, TIMP-4, VEGF, and MIP-3β achieved the highest accuracy with AUROCC ~0.87. The combined model in the U-BIOPRED limited to available inflammatory mediators (VEGF), and incorporating past asthma attacks, Capnocytophaga, Corynebacterium, and Cardiobacterium, resulted in an AUROCC of 0.84. Serum inflammatory mediators and salivary microbiome complement asthma attacks history for predicting future attacks.

This study aims to develop a predictive model to identify high-risk individuals within this populations. This study enrolled AMI patients with T2DM and categorized them into complication and control groups. The mechanical complications were defined as papillary muscle rupture (with or without acute mitral regurgitation), ventricular septal defect, left ventricular pseudoaneurysm or aneurysm (with or without thrombus) and free wall rupture. Characteristics were selected using relaxed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression and random forest model. Selected variables were utilized to construct a nomogram to predict the possibility of mechanical complications. A total of 2,816 patients were enrolled, with 191 individuals classified into the complication group. Baseline analysis identified 31 factors exhibiting potential differences, which were subsequently employed for LASSO-logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression and random forest model. After comprehensive evaluation, nine variables emerged as predictive factors for mechanical complications, including gender, pulmonary hypertension, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, body mass index, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, left ventricle ejection fraction and hemoglobin A1c, which were used to construct a reliable nomogram. The complication group also showed higher in-hospital mortality rates compared to controls, alerting the worse prognosis of these populations. This study identified nine factors upon admission that may be associated with mechanical complications during the hospitalization. A nomogram was developed based on these factors for clinical application. T2DM patients should emphasize glucose control, which may offer benefits following the onset of AMI.",

We used the C2 formulation to deliver TY1, a 24-nucleotide synthetic ncRNA, which targets DNA damage and attenuates inflammation in macrophages. C2-formulated TY1 (TY1C2) efficiently packages and protects TY1 against degradative enzymes. In healthy mice, oral TY1C2 was well-tolerated and nontoxic. Oral TY1C2 exhibited disease-modifying bioactivity in two models of tissue injury: (1) rat myocardial infarction, where a single oral dose of TY1C2 was cardioprotective, on par with intravenously-delivered TY1; and (2) mouse acute lung injury, where a single dose of TY1C2 attenuated pulmonary inflammation. Mechanistic dissection revealed that TY1C2 is taken up by intestinal macrophages, namely those of the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. Afterwards, TY1 could be detected in circulating monocytes for up to 72 h post-ingestion. Unlike TY1, which acts on macrophages, an antisense oligonucleotide against Factor VII, which acts on hepatocytes, is not effective when administered in the C2 formulation. Thus, not all ncRNA drugs are bioactive when delivered by mouth. Oral delivery of macrophage-active RNA opens up a wide range of potential new therapeutic opportunities.",

This study aims to investigate the association between these circulating biomarkers, and the presence of hemodynamically significant pressure or volume overload and adverse clinical outcomes. In an observational cohort of outpatient cardiology patients (N = 1506) the relationship between the four emerging biomarkers and pressure/volume overload using multivariable-adjusted regression models was examined. Elevated levels of the four biomarkers were positively associated with the presence of significant volume overload compared to none/mild valve disease.

This study highlights that circulating biomarkers associated with distinct pathophysiological vascular pathways, including inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification, are elevated in patients with hemodynamically significant volume overload. Given their association with mortality, these biomarkers merit further investigation of their underlying pathways, particularly in conjugation with the established biomarker NT-proBNP, to clarify their potential for more targeted clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are activated into cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs) in myocardial infarction (MI) and promote fibrosis, playing a crucial role in deteriorating cardiac function and inducing fatal arrhythmias. Transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for ischemic heart diseases, including MI. Recent studies have indicated that BMSCs can modulate the survival, differentiation, and antifibrotic activity of CFs. Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a significant transcription factor involved in maintaining stem cell properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether overexpression of KLF5 could enhance the cardioprotective characteristics of BMSCs, particularly in terms of mitigating structural and electrical remodeling. Our in vivo experiments revealed that transplantation of KLF5-overexpressing BMSCs in mice with MI led to a substantial reduction in ventricular fibrosis and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that BMSCs could inhibit CFs activation and cytoskeleton protein bundling induced by hypoxia through paracrine effects, resulting in reduced expression of α-SMA and Collagen I. Furthermore, coculturing BMSCs significantly reduced the expression of connexin 43, alleviated hypoxia, increased the expression of inward-rectifier K+ current (Kir), and decreased voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) currents. Mechanistically, KLF5 enhanced the effects of BMSCs by facilitating the transfer of miR-152-3 p from BMSCs-derived exosomes to CFs. Overall, our findings show that BMSCs transplantation promotes the recovery of cardiac function and reduces the incidence of arrhythmias by inhibiting CFs activation and modulating CFs Kir current remodeling.

    "abstract": "The significance of oral microbiota in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been increasingly appreciated. However, the association between oral microbiota, metabolites, and AMI parameters, as well as the key microbiota and metabolites that may play a crucial role in this process, remains unclear. To investigate the oral microbiome composition and metabolomic profiles associated with AMI and explore the roles of specific bacterial species and key metabolites in functional pathways in the progression of AMI. A case-control study was conducted involving 24 AMI patients and 24 matched healthy controls. Saliva samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted LC-MS metabolomics. Correlation analysis was then performed to explore associations between microbial taxa, metabolomic profiles, and AMI clinical parameters, with results visualized as heatmaps of correlation coefficients. The component of the oral microbiota of the AMI group showed significant alterations when compared to the control group. Particularly, a significant shift in terms of alpha and beta diversity was observed between the AMI and control groups (p < 0.05). The Streptococcus and Rothia genera, as well as 9(R)-HODE, 20-HETE ethanolamide, and 5,6 EET metabolites, were identified as potential biomarkers, achieving an area under the curve of 0.82-0.88. Functional pathway analysis demonstrated significant upregulation in key metabolic pathways, including the Citrate Cycle (TCA cycle), Pyruvate metabolism, and Glucagon signaling pathways, which exhibited strong correlations with established clinical markers of AMI. This integrative analysis underscores the diagnostic potential of oral microbiome-metabolome interactions in AMI and unveils key mechanistic pathways for guiding future therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "Genetic Risk Score Enables a Vaccine for Early Primary Prevention of CAD.",
    "abstract": "Early primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) is limited by lack of biomarkers to detect CAD risk among young asymptomatic individuals. Although early prevention is more effective than secondary interventions, conventional risk factors such as hypertension usually do not appear until the fifth or sixth decade of life. Conversely, genetic risk, which accounts for 50% of all CAD risk, is randomly distributed at conception and does not change with age; therefore, it can be determined any time after birth using a genetic polygenic risk score (PRS). Genetic risk is markedly modified by lifestyle changes and, specifically, lowering levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). CAD risk depends on the concentration and duration of exposure to plasma LDL, which is estimated by the product of age times LDL (mg-years). The minimum threshold for a myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with a plasma LDL of 125 at age 40 is 5,000 mg-years. The goal of primary prevention is to delay reaching the minimal clinical threshold as long as possible. This review makes the case for a long-acting, lipid-lowering drug, administered annually starting at age 30, that could delay the threshold for MI until age 100.",

    "abstract": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an established metric for risk stratification and therapeutic guidance. However, consensus on the optimal technique for quantifying left ventricular (LV) LGE extent remains lacking. This study aimed to identify the most reliable method for quantifying LGE in chronic myocardial infarction (CMI), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and inflammatory heart disease (IHD). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 285 prospectively enrolled patients (CMI: n = 98; HCM: n = 91; IHD: n = 96). LV LGE images in short-axis orientation were analyzed twice by the same reader. The most reliable LGE quantification technique was defined as the one achieving the highest intra-observer reproducibility. A two-step study design was implemented: in the pilot phase (n = 90), three quantification methods were compared: full width at half maximum (FWHM), signal threshold vs. reference mean using 2-6 standard deviations (n-SD), and manual thresholding. Techniques demonstrating the lowest variability were then applied in a validation cohort (n = 195). A mixed model for repeated measures was used to estimate mean differences. Equivalence was confirmed if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference remained within predefined margins. In CMI, FWHM demonstrated the highest reproducibility, with a mean difference of 0.47% (95% CI: -0.40 to 1.35). In HCM, both the 5-SD and 6-SD techniques showed the highest reproducibility, with mean differences of 0.06% (95% CI: -1.28 to 1.39) and -0.16% (95% CI: -1.50 to 1.17), respectively. In IHD, the 5-SD and 6-SD techniques achieved the highest reproducibility, with mean differences of -0.72% (95% CI: -1.54 to 0.11) and -0.71% (95% CI: -1.54 to 0.11). The distribution and pattern of LGE influence the reproducibility of its quantification. FWHM provided the highest intra-observer reproducibility for sharply demarcated scars, as seen in CMI. For more diffuse fibrosis patterns, such as in HCM and IHD, both the 5-SD and 6-SD techniques offered similarly reproducible performance.",

    "abstract": "The combination of selective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a safe and feasible therapy and has become our preferred treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis and high-risk coronary heart disease. However, the timing of staged PCI is uncertain. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the benefits and risks of TAVI alone, PCI before TAVI, simultaneous TAVI and PCI, and PCI after TAVI in TAVI patients, and to provide guidance for clinical decision-making on the timing of PCI in TAVI patients. We searched Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science as of April 2025. By employing Bayesian network meta-analysis, with the aid of R software (V4.3.2) and in combination with Stata (V15), the analysis included outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, bleeding and myocardial infarction (MI). Pooled analysis was performed utilizing risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 13 studies involving 304,181 patients were included in the analysis. The research findings showed that the application of TAVI alone significantly reduced the all-cause mortality compared to PCI after TAVI (RR = 0.35, 95% CrI: 0.13, 0.88), and the lowest all-cause mortality rate was observed in the cumulative ranking (SUCRA = 75.89%). Compared with PCI after TAVI (RR = 0.57, 95% CrI: 0.41, 0.79) and TAVIplus PCI (RR = 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.54, 0.97), PCI before TAVI significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality and was found the lowest cardiovascular mortality in the cumulative ranking (SUCRA = 98.37%). In comparison to TAVIplus PCI (RR = 0.44, 95% CrI: 0.27, 0.71), PCI after TAVI significantly reduced the stroke rate and found the lowest stroke rate in the cumulative ranking (SUCRA = 97.21%). The application of TAVI alone significantly reduced the bleeding rate compared to TAVIplusPCI (RR = 0.61, 95% CrI: 0.60, 0.62), and the lowest bleeding rate was observed in the cumulative ranking (SUCRA = 88.14%). Compared with PCI before TAVI (RR = 0.12, 95% CrI: 0.04, 0.29) and TAVI (RR = 0.21, 95% CrI: 0.12, 0.34), TAVIplusPCI significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and was found the lowest incidence of myocardial infarction in the cumulative ranking (SUCRA = 96.44%). The timing of application of TAVI combined with PCI affects mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular events. Among them, PCI after TAVI may effectively reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke, but the interval between the two procedures remains uncertain. Future studies should investigate the optimal interval between PCI and TAVI to maximize clinical benefits. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, PROSPERO.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite advances in prevention and therapy. Emerging evidence highlights the central role of epigenetic modifications and non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression networks underlying cardiovascular homeostasis and disease. Concurrently, physical exercise has been recognized not only as a preventive and therapeutic strategy for CVDs but also as a potent modulator of epigenetic landscapes. This review explores the mechanistic links between aerobic exercise and epigenetic modulation, focusing on how structured physical activity influences the expression and function of miRNAs and lncRNAs, as well as chromatin remodeling processes in cardiovascular tissues. We provide a comprehensive overview of aerobic exercise-responsive non-coding RNAs implicated in vascular inflammation, endothelial function, cardiac remodeling, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis. Additionally, we discuss aerobic exercise-induced changes in DNA methylation and histone modification patterns that contribute to transcriptional reprogramming and long-term cardiovascular benefits. Finally, the review evaluates the translational potential of targeting aerobic exercise-regulated epigenetic factors for early diagnosis, risk stratification, and personalized therapies in CVD management. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of cardioepigenetic responses to exercise opens promising avenues for precision cardiovascular medicine and integrative therapeutic strategies.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of manual contrast injection followed by OCT catheter advancement in improving image clarity in patients with severe coronary stenosis. This single-centre observational study included 60 patients with acute coronary syndrome who demonstrated antegrade thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow ≥2 on coronary angiography before the OCT catheter was passed through the severe coronary lesions. Catheter advancement resulted in TIMI 0-1 flow. A 7-step \"P\" technique was developed and implemented to optimise OCT imaging clarity, using manual contrast injection followed by catheter advancement distal to the region of interest (ROI). Image quality was evaluated using a semi-quantitative scoring system to assess the number of quadrants (0-4) in which the vessel walls were clearly visualised. A total of 1,722 OCT frames were meticulously analysed, with a mean ROI length of 18.99 ± 8.82 mm. This technique consistently produced high-quality images with an average quality score of 3.88 ± 0.38. The proximal lesion segment generally showed a slightly higher image quality compared to the distal segment, with both regions achieving reasonably high clarity scores (3.90 ± 0.28 vs. 3.85 ± 0.45, p < 0.001), though the clinical relevance of this difference is minimal. No complications occurred. The 7-step \"P\" technique with manual injection is a safe and effective method for acquiring high-quality OCT images in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis, offering a practical alternative in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombotic symptoms (venous, arterial, or small vessels) and/or gestational morbidity in patients carrying antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). Criteria aPLs include anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (aB2GPI) antibodies of the IgG or IgM isotypes, and lupus anticoagulant (LA). However, there are aPLs that are associated with APS events but are not included in the criteria (extra-criteria). The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and association of criteria and extra-criteria aPLs with APS clinical events. A total of 838 patients with clinical manifestations of APS were studied. In total, 715 presented with vascular manifestations, and 130 presented with obstetric morbidity. We measured levels of criteria aPLs, and the extra-criteria aPLs determined were anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) of IgG and IgM isotypes and aB2GPI IgA. Classic aPL, aPS/PT, and aB2GPI IgA positivity showed a significant and independent association with thrombosis (OR: 2.40, 2.36, and 2.53 respectively). IgA aB2GP1 was the only aPL significantly associated with the five types of thrombotic events (venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and arterial thrombosis). Regarding obstetric APS, the most relevant antibodies were classic aPL of IgM isotype (OR: 36.04) and aPS/PT of both isotypes (OR: 4.4). The other aPL studied did not show association in multivariate analysis. The degree of clinical association for each group of aPLs was different depending on the form of presentation (vascular or obstetric) and the presence or absence of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, a fair level of agreement between LA and aPS/PT positivity was found; therefore, aPS/PT should not be referred to as a surrogate marker of LA.",

    "abstract": "Background: Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings like Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess time to mortality and identify key predictors among adult HF patients at Jimma Medical Center (JMC). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 356 adult HF patients admitted to JMC between 2022 and 2023. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify mortality predictors. Results: Among 356 HF patients, 15.7% (95% CI: 12.2%-19.8%) died during the study period. The median hospital stay was 11 days (IQR: 7-17), and the median age was 55 years (IQR: 38-65). Key predictors of higher mortality included hypertension (AHR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.88-11.61, p < 0.001), pneumonia (AHR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.15-15.78, p = 0.031), anemia (AHR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.17-9.06, p = 0.023), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (AHR: 4.4, 95% CI: 1.9-10.09, p < 0.001), and hyponatremia (AHR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.44-5.99, p = 0.003). Each unit increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was linked to a 7% and 4% lower mortality risk, respectively (p = 0.035). A higher pulse rate was associated with a 4% increased mortality risk. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) had a six-fold higher mortality risk compared to those with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (AHR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.79-24.4, p = 0.008). Conclusion: This study identifies key mortality predictors for HF patients in a resource-limited setting, including hypertension, pneumonia, anemia, AMI, and hyponatremia. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions, improved management strategies, and policies to reduce HF mortality in low-resource environments. Further research is needed to refine these findings and enhance care for HF patients in such settings.",

The inclusion criteria were studies that enrolled MI patients, stratified by the presence of fQRS, and reported at least one of the following outcomes: no-reflow, infarct size, reinfarction, or repeat revascularization during hospitalization. No-reflow was defined as a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade < 3. A total of 19 studies with 5840 participants were analyzed using a random-effects model.

Subgroup analysis by study design supported this finding. However, there were no significant differences in infarct size, in-hospital reinfarction, or need for repeat revascularization between groups. The presence of fQRS was associated with a higher risk of no-reflow in MI patients. fQRS could serve as a useful tool for predicting no-reflow and guiding primary prevention strategies in MI patients.",

These chatbots were used because of their popularity and high usage rates among chatbots. Using Google Trends, the top five U.S. search queries related to heart attack, arrhythmia, and heart failure from September 29, 2018, to September 29, 2023, were identified. The top five queries were chosen in relation to these topics because they accounted for over 80% of the public's searches related to these topics. The chatbot responses were blinded and analyzed by two evaluators using DISCERN for quality, Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) for understandability and actionability, and Flesch-Kincaid scores for readability. Statistical tests included the Kruskal-Wallis test for DISCERN, the chi-square test for PEMAT, and one-way ANOVA for Flesch-Kincaid scores. Bard generated responses with a statistically lower Flesch-Kincaid reading score than the other chatbots. Bard and ChatGPT 3.5 provided more actionable responses. Among the CVD topics, \"heart attack\" yielded lower-grade-level responses and more actionable information compared to \"arrhythmia\" and \"heart failure.\" This study is among the first to assess AI credibility in disseminating cardiovascular information.

    "abstract": "Background and objective Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiographic abnormality resulting from impaired conduction in both the His-Purkinje system's anterior and posterior left fascicles. LBBB prevalence varies with age, gender, race, and underlying cardiovascular conditions. It affects 0.06-0.1% of the general population, rising to 6-7% in those over 80, and is often detected incidentally in older males. Although once considered a ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent in chest pain, recent data indicate a low risk of myocardial infarction. Diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) in these patients is challenging due to limitations of noninvasive tests, often necessitating coronary angiography (CAG) for confirmation. CT angiography is typically the first-line test for patients under 65, while stress nuclear imaging or dobutamine stress echo is preferred in those 65 and older. Certain ECG changes, like ST elevation or depression, may suggest myocardial infarction in LBBB cases. This study aimed to examine various demographic and clinical features, as well as outcomes, in patients presenting with symptomatic LBBB Methods This non-randomized, prospective, single-center observational study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, demographic profile, and outcomes of patients presenting with symptomatic LBBB. All enrolled patients underwent CAG, with or without subsequent revascularization, as part of their diagnostic workup. Results A total of 200 symptomatic LBBB patients, comprising 104 males (52%), with a mean age of 60.2 ± 11.4 years, were included in the study. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities, observed in 98 (49%) and 68 (34%) patients, respectively. Additionally, 160 (80%) patients exhibited some degree of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. CAG showed normal findings in 100 patients (50%), obstructive CAD in 78 (39%), and non-obstructive CAD in 22 (11%). The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the most involved vessel, affected in 70 patients (70%). Among the 78 patients with obstructive CAD, 72 (92.3%) had severe obstruction. The LAD artery was the most affected vessel, observed in 60 patients (76.9%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 42 patients, eight were referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and 28 were managed with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Age ≥50 years (p=0.005), angina (p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p<0.001), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤50% (p=0.006) were significantly associated with obstructive CAD. Mortality was also significantly higher in this group (p=0.001). During the six-month follow-up, 12 patients (6%), all over 70 years, died, resulting in an overall survival rate of 94% despite the high-risk profile. Conclusions Older patients with LBBB who present with angina, cardiovascular risk factors, and LV systolic dysfunction should be evaluated for CAD by using CAG, especially when troponin markers are elevated (troponin I >0.04 ng/mL).",

    "abstract": "Introduction Ground-level falls are a common mechanism of trauma, especially in the elderly. They are typically classified by etiology as syncopal or mechanical, based on a report of syncope (loss of consciousness due to transient reduction of cerebral blood flow). Syncopal falls generally prompt an evaluation of the cause of syncope, but the utility of this investigation and hence this classification system remains uncertain. Methods This retrospective registry review compares outcomes for patients with falls classified as syncopal versus mechanical. The data source is the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. Patients experiencing a fall documented in the history of present illness (HPI) or during the admission were included. Syncopal versus mechanical etiology was analyzed as a predictive factor for length of stay, mortality, and cardiovascular and neurologic outcomes. Significance for categorical variables was tested with a chi-square and continuous variables with a T-test. Multivariate analysis was performed with logistic regression for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes. Results Overall mortality for mechanical falls was 384 (54.2%) versus 480 (45.2%) for syncopal (p<0.001). Conditions more common among the syncopal group include cardiac valve disorder - 151 (14.2%) versus 76 (10.7%) (p=0.038), arrhythmia - 540 (50.8%) versus 322 (45.5%) (p=0.03), orthostatic hypotension - 38 (3.6%) versus 8 (1.1%) (p=0.003), and need for pacemaker implant or revision - 87 (8.2%) versus 13 (1.8%) (p<0.001). The difference in myocardial infarction was not significant. Syncopal etiology was an independent predictor of outcomes including overall mortality - adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.75 (p=0.005), gastrointestinal bleed- (OR) 1.74 (p=<0.001), orthostatic hypotension - OR 3.34 (p=0.002), and need for pacemaker placement or revision - OR 4.0 (p<0.001). Conclusion Mortality was lower for patients with syncopal falls. Cardiovascular conditions were significantly more common among syncopal fall patients, but the incidence, especially for arrhythmia, was high and nearly equal in the mechanical group. We believe that a standard workup for orthostasis and arrhythmia should be performed for both groups, regardless of syncopal versus mechanical etiology.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with diabetes. Understanding national time trends in both CVD prevalence and related hospitalizations is essential for informing clinical and public health strategies. This study aims to examine long‑term trends in CVD prevalence and hospitalization rates among US adults with diagnosed diabetes using the United States Diabetes Surveillance System (USDSS), which combines self‑reported survey data and administrative claims. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of USDSS data from 2000 to 2022. Adults aged ≥18 years with diagnosed diabetes were included. CVD prevalence was ascertained via self‑report or claims of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Annual crude hospitalization rates (per 1,000 diabetic individuals) were calculated using the total number of adults with diagnosed diabetes each year as the denominator; hospitalization data were available through 2020. Temporal trends were evaluated using linear trend analysis in addition to independent t‑tests (sex differences) and one‑way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (age and race/ethnicity disparities), with p < 0.05 denoting significance. From 2000 to 2022, major heart disease prevalence rose from 21.1% to 23.7% and then declined to 17.4%; however, absolute cases increased from 2.7 million to 4.9 million, a reflection of a growing diabetic population rather than a static denominator. Stroke prevalence peaked at 10.5% in 2008 before falling to 7.4% in 2022, while case counts doubled from 1.1 million to 2.1 million. Between 2000 and 2020, crude CVD hospitalization rates fell from 78.6 to 46.0 per 1,000 (data truncated at 2020 due to USDSS availability). Males consistently had higher rates than females (p < 0.05). Older adults (≥65 years) demonstrated the highest rates, with the ≥75 subgroup exhibiting the greatest absolute decline. Non‑Hispanic Black individuals experienced significantly higher hospitalization rates than other racial/ethnic groups (p < 0.05). Although crude hospitalization rates for CVD among adults with diabetes declined over two decades, the absolute burden of disease rose in step with the expanding diabetic population. Significant disparities by age, sex, and race persist. Targeted interventions addressing both clinical care and population‑level drivers are needed for high‑risk diabetic subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Background Systemic inflammatory diseases (SID) are associated with adverse cardiovascular (CV) events due to the derangement in innate immunity. Understanding the association with acute myocarditis (AMC) is crucial for preemptive management strategies and improving patient outcomes. Methods We identified and compared adults (>18 years) with SID versus non-SID who were hospitalized with AMC using a large, nationally representative inpatient database from 2016 to 2021 and standardized diagnostic codes. Six SIDs were selected based on the distribution of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The risks of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (ischemic stroke, cardiac arrest, acute heart failure (AHF), ventricular arrhythmia (VA), complete atrioventricular block, acute myocardial infarction (AMI)) and use of circulatory support were assessed in adult AMC admissions with and without SID after adjusting for confounders. SID was divided into six cohorts: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis (MS) subgroups. Results Overall, there were 34,540 adult admissions to AMC. Prevalence of AMC in non-SID 96% (34,540/35,865). The mean age of non-SID was similar across the four cohorts, but relatively older in RA and MS (60.8 and 59.5 years, respectively). The cohorts also had a higher proportion of females in the PS and IBD cohorts. Hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking were more frequently seen in the SID-AMC cohort. At the same time, obesity was more regularly seen in RA and MS, diabetes mellitus (DM) was more commonly seen in SLE and MS, and hyperlipidemia was more frequent with SLE, RA, PS, and MS. The RA-AMC cohort had significantly higher adjusted odds of using mechanical circulatory support (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, CI 1.22-6.55, p = 0.015) after adjusting for sex, dyslipidemia, DM, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, odds outcomes of acute, VA, mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events were not statistically significant. Conclusions The RA-AMC cohort is 280% more likely to require mechanical circulatory support during hospitalization for AMC, suggesting worse AHF and cardiogenic shock outcomes. Prospective studies would be necessary to further examine the cardiovascular outcomes in this cohort.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic potential of endothelial progenitor cell-derived microvesicles (EPC-MVs) in a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, focusing on their effects on inflammation, apoptosis, and global proteomic changes in the left ventricle. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were isolated from mouse bone marrow, and microvesicles (MVs) were derived and injected into rats with MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by measuring inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and cardiac injury markers (creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin), along with histologic and apoptotic analyses. A global proteomic analysis of left ventricular tissue was performed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Key targets, including components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, Caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), were validated by western blotting. EPC-MV treatment significantly reduced MI-induced cardiac injury, as evidenced by decreased inflammatory cytokines and cardiac injury markers, preservation of myocardial architecture, reduced fibrosis, and suppression of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Proteomic analysis revealed significant alterations in inflammatory and metabolic pathways, supported by KEGG and Reactome enrichment analyses. Molecular validation confirmed that EPC-MVs inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downregulated downstream effectors, including IL-6 and atrial natriuretic peptide. EPC-MVs alleviated myocardial ischemic injury by remodeling the cardiac proteome, suppressing inflammatory and apoptotic signaling. These results position EPC-MVs as a promising cell-free therapeutic strategy for MI.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between PDL and clinical outcomes after LAAC. Using data from the OCEAN-LAAC (Optimized Catheter Valvular Intervention-Left Atrial Appendage Closure) Japanese multicenter registry, we examined 1397 patients who underwent LAAC between September 2019 and December 2022. The primary outcome was transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, or systemic embolism within 2 years of LAAC. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without PDL at device implantation using Fine and Gray multivariable regression analyses and propensity score matching. Additional analyses were performed by categorizing PDL into 2 groups: ≤3 mm and >3 mm but ≤5 mm. Of 1397 patients who underwent LAAC, 84 (6.0%) had PDL, of whom 73 (86.9%) had ≤3 mm PDL. Patients with PDL had a larger left atrium and higher CHADS2 scores than those without PDL. Multivariable analyses showed that PDL was significantly associated with a higher risk of transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, or systemic embolism (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 4.25 [95% CI, 1.91-9.44]; P<0.001). Even PDL ≤3 mm was independently associated with an increased risk compared with no PDL (adjusted sHR, 3.53 [95% CI, 1.37-9.04]; P=0.016). Propensity score matching analyses revealed consistent findings. PDL was associated with a higher risk of transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, or systemic embolism, even PDL ≤3 mm. Therefore, it may be necessary to aim for no PDL as much as possible.",

Sub-analysis aimed to evaluate event rates in relation to accumulated risk factors (RFs) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, New York Heart Association class III/IV, left bundle branch block/wide QRS, renal dysfunction, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, age > 70 years, and smoking). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (N = 102) and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (N = 69) enrollees were evaluated for first appropriately treated ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF), recurrent heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. Event rates were compared for patients with lower-risk (2-3 RFs) and higher-risk (4-5 RFs) using time to event analyses. The ICD-cohort contained 50 (49%) lower-risk and 52 (51%) higher-risk patients, and the CRT-D-cohort 21 (30%) lower-risk and 48 (70%) higher-risk patients. Over 24 months, no significant difference was observed in the VT/VF event rate among the higher-risk group compared to the lower-risk group for either device cohort (ICD: 17% vs. 10%, p = 0.61; CRT-D: 6% vs. 5%, p = 0.79). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the rate of all-cause mortality, although higher-risk patients trended towards more mortality (ICD: 15% vs. 7%, p = 0.15; CRT-D: 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.33) For the ICD cohort, the risk of HF hospitalization was 2.24 (95% CI: 1.24-4.03) times greater in the higher-risk group compared to the lower-risk group and among those hospitalized for HF, the length of stay was significantly longer for the higher-risk group (median 27 days per year vs. 10 days per year, p = 0.013). No significant difference in the rate of HF hospitalizations was detected for the CRT-D cohort. The implantation of ICD should be considered despite the number of RFs to prevent sudden cardiac death. Proper CRT-D implantation may reduce the number of RFs over time and shorten the duration of HF-hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend immediate surgical repair for post-infarct ventricular septal rupture (VSR); however, mortality remains exceedingly high. We sought to report outcomes following delayed surgical management bridged with microaxial support. A comprehensive literature search yielded 42 case reports/series comprising 78 patients who were initiated on microaxial support following the diagnosis of post-infarct VSR. Patient-level data were extracted and analyzed according to survival status. Overall, 78% (54/69) of patients were male, and the median age was 69 [IQR: 60-74] years, with no difference in age between survivors and non-survivors. Those who survived were significantly less likely to have a history of prior cardiac surgery than non-survivors [3% (1/30) vs. 43% (3/7), p = 0.016], and less likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention at the time of presentation [41% (22/54) vs. 69% (11/16), p = 0.049]. There were no significant differences in culprit vessel (p = 0.875), VSR size (p = 1), or VSR location (p = 0.253). Those who survived had a significantly higher median Qp/Qs ratio than non-survivors [3.0 [2.3-3.8] vs. 2.1 [1.9-2.3], p = 0.038]. Patients were successfully bridged to definitive surgical management in 76% (59/78) of cases at a median time of 8 [5-14] days following microaxial support placement. The 30-day/in-hospital mortality rate was 22% (17/78), and the overall mortality rate was 27% (21/78). Microaxial devices can safely and feasibly provide the necessary support to allow for a successful delayed repair in hemodynamically unstable patients following post-infarct VSR.",

    "abstract": "Platelets play a crucial role in arterial thrombus formation, offering potential for new antiplatelet therapies with reduced bleeding risk. Here, we investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in human platelets and explored its potential link to COVID-19 coagulopathy. Experiments were performed ex vivo on healthy human platelets. The expression of RAS receptors (Mas, MrgD, ACE, ACE2, AT1 and AT2) was evaluated using western blot and immunofluorescence. Platelets were incubated in vitro with either Captopril or different RAS peptides including Alamandine, Angiotensin-I, Angiotensin-II, Angiotensin-(1-7), and Angiotensin-(1-9). Platelet adhesion was measured by spectrophotometry using BCECF fluorescence. Platelet activation and aggregation were analyzed using aggregometry after stimulation with extracellular matrix proteins. ACE and ACE2 activity were assessed using Fluorescent Peptides (FPS). We demonstrated that healthy human platelets express all the tested RAS receptors. However, RAS peptides did not modulate platelet adhesion or aggregation despite a wide range of concentrations tested. ACE activity was detected in platelet lysates, but it was not inhibited by Captopril, while ACE2 activity was undetectable. Our findings suggest that while RAS receptors are expressed in platelets, RAS peptides do not impact platelet function, at least in our experimental setting. COVID-19 coagulopathy may occur independently of the RAS. Platelets play a crucial role in the formation of a blood clot after vessel injury. However, blood clots can also obstruct arteries ( = arterial thrombosis), resulting in heart attack, stroke, or peripheral ischemia. As platelets play such an important role in the pathological development of arterial thrombosis, antiplatelet therapies aim to reduce the risk of recurrence of these diseases. Antiplatelet therapies usually work by targeting specific receptors to reduce platelet activity, i.e. platelet adhesion, aggregation and activation. As current antiplatelet agents can cause bleeding, research aims to develop new strategies to target only pathological platelet conditions. In this study, we tried to characterize the effect of different peptides belonging to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on platelets. As the RAS plays an important role in blood pressure regulation, we sought to establish whether it also plays a role in platelet activity. Furthermore, as SARS-CoV-2 usually enters cells via ACE2, an enzyme belonging to the RAS, we questioned whether the RAS could play a role in peripheral thrombosis associated with severe COVID-19 disease (COVID-19 coagulopathy). We observed that RAS receptors are expressed by platelets, while RAS peptides did not affect platelet adhesion, aggregation, and activation in our experiments. Consequently, we do not think that the RAS plays a significant role in platelet dynamics and COVID-19 coagulopathy.",

While real-world data-based pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology studies have derived knowledge on potential adverse three-drug combinations, the relationship between doses of each drug in three-drug combination exposure and the risk of ADEs remains unclear. We derived matched case-control datasets from US nationwide health insurance claims data for potential ADEs including acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, and opioid-related ADE. We used the conditional logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the dose of three-drug combination exposure and the risk of ADE. We used Benjamini and Hochberg's procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR). We explored the relationship between the reduction of drug dose and the risk of ADE. We identified over 500 potential adverse three-drug combinations from approximately two million case-control pairs (all odds ratios ≥ 1.3 and FDR < 0.05). For the signals, compared with a high-dose level of all three drugs, 74% of three-drug combinations had a lower risk by decreasing the dose of one drug without any drug discontinuation (p value < 0.05). Certain three-drug combinations are associated with an increased risk of ADE. Dose of exposure might be used to evaluate the risk of ADE for a majority of adverse three-drug combinations. Use of three-drug combinations is increasingly prevalent and associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). We identified potential adverse three-drug combinations from real-world data, and revealed the corresponding relationships between doses and risks of ADEs. We find doses might be used to evaluate the risk of ADE for many adverse three-drug combinations. Additionally, we find risk of many adverse three-drug combinations might be decreased by reducing the dose of one drug without any drug discontinuation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIt is widely accepted that elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, even patients who have achieved LDL-C levels below the currently recommended targets may still have residual risk. Recently, Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has attracted significant attention as independent causal risk factor for CHD. Nonetheless, the role of Lp(a) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieved the LDL-C target (≤1.4 mmol/L) remains unclear.MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled 462 ACS patients with comorbid T2DM who underwent PCI, with a median follow-up duration of 27 months post-procedure. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as all-cause death, recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, or hospitalization due to recurrent angina. Based on MACE occurrences, patients were divided into MACE group and non-MACE group. Furthermore, patients were further divided into three groups according to their Lp(a) levels. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed.ResultsPatients with MACE had more coronary artery lesions, and the plasma Lp(a) concentrations in the MACE group were significantly higher than in the non-MACE group. The incidence of MACE and recurrent AMI was higher in the Lp(a) ≥ 180 mg/dL group compared to the other two groups. Even after multivariate adjustment, Lp(a) ≥ 180 mg/dL remained closely associated with an increased risk of MACE (HR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.47-5.41, P = .002) and recurrent AMI (HR 3.71, 95% CI: 1.17-11.81, P = .026).ConclusionElevated Lp(a) levels were strongly associated with poor prognosis in ACS patients with T2DM who underwent PCI.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of uncontrolled hypertension, often referred to as the \"silent killer,\" encompass end-organ damage, leading to conditions, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), renal failure, and stroke. The recommended approach for managing high blood pressure involves both pharmacological and behavioral therapies. Existing evidence suggests that individuals with cardio-metabolic diseases may exhibit a deficiency in Coenzyme CoQ10 (CoQ10), potentially contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation associated with hypertension. Various mechanisms, including an increase in the dietary intake of antioxidant elements, have been postulated to underlie this phenomenon. Because of its anti-oxidative qualities, anti-inflammatory effects, impact on endothelial nitric oxide synthase, improvement of endothelial function, modulation of vascular smooth muscle activity, and reduction of arterial stiffness, CoQ10 has been suggested as a possible alternative therapy for hypertension and related complications. Clinical trials have produced findings that suggest CoQ10 supplementation may lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals diagnosed with essential hypertension, frequently as a component of adjunctive therapy. Nonetheless, a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that determine the effects of CoQ10 on blood pressure and its related complications continues to be elusive. This narrative review investigates the mechanistic effects of CoQ10 on hypertension and its accompanying consequences, with an emphasis on its pharmacological impact on inflammation and oxidative-related pathways. We have conducted an exhaustive literature search, identifying several studies that assess the safety and effectiveness of CoQ10 supplementation in hypertensive patients.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. One of the major factors predisposing patients to the development of POAF is inflammation related to pericardial effusions, which may occur after cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that by creating a pleuro-pericardial window before closing the chest during cardiac surgery, draining the pericardial space into the right pleural space may lead to fewer pericardial effusions and less postoperative atrial fibrillation. We conducted a study that included 172 consecutive patients (67 ± 12 years, 48.3% female) who underwent cardiac surgery (73.8% aortic valve replacement [AVR], 5.8% mitral valve replacement, 19% AVR + coronary artery bypass grafting). The first 95 patients included in this study (67 ± 12 years, 48% female) did not have any pleuro-pericardial window created, whereas the remaining 77 patients (67 ± 12 years, 48% female) did. Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Postoperative events and complications were collected until hospital discharge. A total of 50 patients developed POAF (29%). The incidence of POAF among patients who underwent a pleuro-pericardial window was 18.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.4%-27.0%). The incidence of POAF among those who underwent the standard technique was 37.7% (95% CI: 28.0%-47.8%).

Hospital records were assessed, blinded to cTn, to determine the diagnosis AMI. High-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and troponin I (TnI) were analysed.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular and oncology trials increasingly require large sample sizes and long follow-up periods. Several approaches have been developed to optimize sample size including sample size re-estimation based on the promising zone approach. With time-to-event endpoints, methods traditionally used to test for treatment effects are based on proportional hazards assumptions, which may not always hold. We propose an adaptive design wherein using interim data, Bayesian computation of Predictive Power (PP) guides the increase in sample size and/or the minimum follow-up duration. PROTECT IV is designed to evaluate mechanical circulatory support device vs. standard of care during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention with the initial enrolment of 1252 patients and initial minimum follow-up of 12 months. The primary endpoint is the composite rate of all-cause death, stroke, durable left ventricular assist device implant or heart transplant, myocardial infarction or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. The study will employ an adaptive increase in sample size and/or minimum follow-up at the Interim analysis. The adaptations utilize simulations to choose a new sample size up to 2500 and new minimal follow-up time up to 36 months that provides PP of at least 90%. Via extensive simulations, we have examined the utility of the proposed design for situations like delayed treatment effect, early benefit only and in general crossing of survival curves. Separate Piece-wise Constant Hazard Models with non-influential (weakly-informative) Gamma-priors are fitted to the interim data for the two treatment arms, free from the proportional hazards assumptions, thus yielding more robust interim decision making. The Bayesian modeling facilitates sampling of future observations from the posterior predictive distributions with the predictive probability of trial success is computed via Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that the fitting Bayesian Piecewise Exponential models to the interim data along with the use of the posterior predictive distributions lead to more \"specific\" adaptation rules compared to the frequentist Conditional Power while the overall operating characteristics, type-I error and power, are similar. For clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints and where crossing of survival curves might be anticipated at the planning stage, flexible modeling along with wholesome use of patient-level data such as the calculation of predictive power as proposed here, may be more robust and efficient in making interim decisions such as sample size increase than the traditional use of the conditional power based on summary statistics and proportional hazards assumption.",

    "abstract": "To compare the prognostic impact of heparin pretreatment versus intraprocedural administration in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. There is a paucity of data regarding the best timing for heparin administration in STEMI. We systematically searched the literature for studies evaluating the comparative efficacy and safety of heparin pretreatment versus intraprocedural administration for the treatment of STEMI from 1980 to 2024. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed comparing clinical outcomes between the two groups. 11 observational studies and 4 clinical trials with a total of 72,249 patients were included. The patients either received UFH at the time of diagnosis or during the pPCI. A pretreatment approach showed a significant decrease in death both at 30 days (OR = 0.68; 95 % CI 0.56-0.84) as well as at longer follow-up (Mean follow-up time 14.4 months; OR = 0.67; 95 % CI 0.48-0.94). Moreover, UFH pretreatment increased the rate of infarct related artery patency (IRA) (defined as TIMI 2-3) at first coronary angiography (OR = 1.54; 95 % CI 1.37-1.74), and did not show increase in major bleedings (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.74-1.24). A heparin pretreatment strategy at the time of diagnosis of STEMI is associated with increased patency of the infarct related artery and with a decreased risk of death without any safety concern regarding bleeding complications.",

    "abstract": "No pharmacological therapy has been shown with certainty to improve the cardiovascular prognosis in patients with kidney failure on chronic haemodialysis. We aimed to investigate the effects of the steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone on cardiovascular outcomes in patients on haemodialysis who are at high risk of cardiovascular events. ALCHEMIST was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial conducted at 64 university hospitals, general hospitals, and non-profit or private practice dialysis centres in France, Belgium, and Monaco. Adult patients aged 18 years and older with kidney failure on chronic haemodialysis with at least one cardiovascular comorbidity or risk factor were enrolled into a 4-week run-in period on open-label oral spironolactone 25 mg every other day. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral spironolactone titrated to 25 mg per day or placebo. The randomisation sequence was computer generated and stratified by centre in blocks of 4 or 6, and permutation of treatments within each block. The random assignment was double-blinded. The primary endpoint was time to first major adverse cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or hospitalisation for heart failure) and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. We also performed an updated meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients on haemodialysis incorporating data from ALCHEMIST. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01848639. Between June 13, 2013, and Nov 24, 2020, 1442 patients were locally screened for eligibility. 823 patients were included in the trial and 794 entered the run-in period. 644 patients were randomly assigned to spironolactone (n=320) or placebo (n=324). 444 (69%) patients were men and 200 (31%) were women. The trial was stopped prematurely due to lack of funding from the sponsor. Median follow-up was 32·6 months (IQR 17·3-48·4). The primary endpoint occurred in 78 (24%) of 320 patients in the spironolactone group (10·66 per 100 patient-years [95% CI 8·54-13·31]) and 79 (24%) of 324 patients in the placebo group (10·70 per 100 patient-years [8·59-13·35]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·00 [95% CI 0·73-1·36]; p=0·98). Hyperkalaemia above 6 mmol/L was reported in 135 (42%) patients in the spironolactone group and 134 (41%) in the placebo group (HR 1·12 [95% CI 0·88-1·43]). In the meta-analysis, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists did not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events and did not increase the odds of hyperkalaemia events (serum potassium concentration >6 mmol/L). In patients with kidney failure on haemodialysis and with high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, spironolactone did not reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The updated meta-analysis shows that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists did not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, off-label use of spironolactone in this setting is not supported by available evidence. French Ministry of Health.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative smoking cessation can reduce adverse postoperative outcomes. Investment in smoking cessation therapies has therefore proven cost effective prior to elective interventions across numerous disciplines. Despite high rates of smoking among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), the cost effectiveness of smoking cessation before elective revascularization is unclear. Using a Markov model, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of preoperative smoking cessation therapies (standard care, counseling, nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], varenicline, bupropion) for 65-year-old patients undergoing open or endovascular revascularization for symptomatic PAD. Local data quantified smoking cessation therapy costs. Established literature informed therapy effectiveness, postoperative outcomes (stroke, myocardial infarction, major amputation, patency, death) frequencies, and postoperative costs. Lifetime costs were quantified in US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses tested model robustness. In the base-case scenario, standard care was least expensive ($326,280) and varenicline was costliest ($333,335). However, varenicline was the most effective (7.11 QALYs), while standard care was least effective (6.43 QALYs). NRT and varenicline were the most cost-effective therapies. In the probabilistic simulation (randomly varying model parameters over 1000 iterations), varenicline was favored in 80.3% at $100,000/QALY gained. Assuming no mortality differences by smoking status, in one-way sensitivity analyses varenicline dominated all other therapies. Smoking cessation adjuncts are cost effective prior to PAD interventions. Varenicline and NRT were the most cost-effective smoking cessation strategies. Our results highlight the value of supplemented coverage for smoking cessation therapies among patients with PAD undergoing revascularization.",

To examine ACE patterns and their specific associations with chronic conditions. 300,854 US adults (51.4 % women, 75.8 % <65 years) randomly sampled in the 2021 and 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. ACEs were measured using the CDC-Kaiser Permanente ACE study questionnaire on household dysfunction, abuse, and neglect. Chronic health conditions were self-reported, including heart attack, angina/coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis, kidney disease, diabetes, arthritis, and depressive disorder. Descriptive statistics were weighted to increase sample representativeness. Latent class analysis identified ACE patterns. Bivariate and multivariable robust Poisson regression examined associations with chronic conditions adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated. A 3-class model of ACE patterns was identified, referring to low ACE class (73.8 %), non-sexual high ACE class (18.9 %), and high ACE class with sexual abuse (7.3 %). The high ACE class with sexual abuse showed higher adjusted RRs (range 1.29-2.46; PAFs range 0.22-0.59) with each of the chronic conditions and multimorbidity, compared with the non-sexual high ACE class (aRRs range 1.10-2.01; PAFs range 0.09-0.50) and low ACE class (reference). ACEs can be differentiated into three classes in US adults. The high ACE class with sexual abuse showed higher risks for chronic conditions and multimorbidity. Screening of ACEs can be integrated into prevention programs for chronic conditions. Personalized interventions are warranted for different ACE classes.",

This economic evaluation utilized individual data from clinical trials to compare major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) at 30 days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 1 year between an intervention group (TXL combined with conventional therapy) and the control group (placebo plus conventional therapy), from a healthcare perspective. A lifetime cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted using a Markov model, and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. A total of 3777 patients (TXL: 1889; placebo: 1888) were included in the analysis. The 30-day total costs for the TXL and placebo groups were ¥38,561 ($5399) and ¥39,217 ($5490), respectively, showing no statistical difference. The 30-day MACCEs rates were 3.39% for the TXL group and 5.24% for the placebo group (p < 0.006), indicating TXL's superiority in effectiveness at 30 days. Over a lifetime, the TXL group incurred higher total costs (¥97,108 [$13,595] vs. ¥92,033 [$12,885]) and gained more QALYs (6.70 vs. 6.30). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TXL was ¥12,421/QALY ($1739), below the 1 Gross Domestic Product per capital threshold which was ¥89,358 ($12,510) in 2023 in China. Sensitivity analysis confirmed robust results, revealing that TXL was more likely to be accepted over the placebo when the willingness to pay exceeds ¥12,500 ($1739).

The role of TCA cycle metabolites in modulating macrophage-driven cardiac inflammation remains unclear. This study hypothesized that AKG supplementation attenuates cardiac dysfunction by regulating macrophage activation via TCA cycle replenishment and FTO-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Myocardial infarction was induced in male C57BL/6 mice and macrophage-specific FTO knockout mice via left anterior descending artery ligation. Mice received AKG supplementation. Techniques included echocardiography, histopathology, flow cytometry (quantifying Ly6C+ macrophages), m6A-RIP-qPCR (assessing Stat3 mRNA methylation), Western blotting (JAK1/STAT3 pathway), Seahorse metabolic analysis (BMDMs), and in vitro BMDM cultures. Data are mean ± SD; statistical significance (p < 0.05) assessed by t-test/ANOVA. AKG restored TCA cycle flux and significantly reduced infarct size (p < 0.01). It attenuated pro-inflammatory Ly6C+ macrophage infiltration (p < 0.05) versus controls. AKG required macrophage FTO expression, increasing STAT3 nuclear translocation (p < 0.05) via FTO-mediated m6A demethylation of Stat3 mRNA (p < 0.01). This activated JAK1/STAT3 signaling, driving anti-inflammatory polarization and metabolic reprogramming (p < 0.05). AKG supplementation attenuates post-infarction cardiac dysfunction primarily through FTO-mediated m6A demethylation of Stat3 in macrophages, activating JAK1/STAT3 signaling to promote anti-inflammatory polarization and metabolic reprogramming. This defines a novel metabolite-epigenetic pathway (AKG-FTO-m6A-STAT3) for immunomodulation in ischemic injury, highlighting TCA cycle replenishment as a therapeutic strategy.",

In this study, 396 consecutive NSTEMI patients who underwent coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention between 1 August 2023, and 31 July 2024, were included. Patients were stratified into low (NPS: 0-1), intermediate (NPS: 2), and high (NPS: 3-4) risk groups. Median follow-up was 433 days. Univariate logistic regression identified predictors of longterm mortality. These were then entered into LASSOpenalized logistic regression for variable selection. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models assessed the independent predictors of long-term mortality, adjusting for SYNTAX score, hemoglobin, sodium, age, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). High-risk NPS patients (n = 91) had higher long-term mortality (17.6%) compared with intermediate-risk (3.7%) and low-risk (3.5%) groups (p < 0.001). In the adjusted Cox model, high-risk NPS independently predicted long-term mortality (HR:3.79; 95% CI 1.55-9.27; p = 0.003), whereas neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were not significant when substituted for NPS.

In this study, we evaluated initial clinical outcomes of IVUS-guided PCI with IVL for severe calcified lesions. Consecutive IVL cases performed at our hospital between April and October 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes included cross-sectional area (CSA, mm2) and percent area stenosis (%AS) at the pre-IVL minimum lumen area (MLA) site as measured by IVUS. Pre-IVL, post-IVL, and post-stent results were compared. Secondary outcomes included angiographic success, procedural complications, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 1 year. Thirty-one patients with 32 lesions were included. CSA values at the pre-IVL MLA site were 2.2 ± 0.9, 4.2 ± 1.5, and 7.5 ± 2.3 mm2, and %AS values were 80.1 ± 7.2%, 62.9 ± 12.3%, and 35.5 ± 16.3% (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are transported by high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Hypercholesterolemic HDL particles are enriched with miR-126-3p/5p, which can be delivered to endothelial cells, leading to the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key transcription factor involved in metabolic responses to hypoxia and cell survival during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). To investigate the effects of miR-126 mimic and inhibitor transfection on the HIF-1α/apoptosis axis in cardiac cell constituents under experimental I/R. Firstly, specific durations of I/R were established for cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) based on their susceptibility to metabolic changes and cell death. Then, we assessed the impact of transfecting these cells with mimic-miR-126-5p and anti-miR-126-5p to the selected timings of I/R on the HIF-1α/apoptosis axis. Endothelial cells were resistant to I/R and fibroblasts were sensitive to ischemia whereas cardiomyocytes displayed high metabolic flexibility. Endogenous miR-126 expression was exclusively found in endothelial cells. Transfection with anti-miR-126 increased HIF-1α transcription in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, while reducing HIF-1α levels in fibroblasts, resulted in decreased transcript levels of apoptotic markers. HIF-1α transcript levels remained unchanged in macrophages and transfection with mimic-miR-126 exerted no changes in the HIF-1α/apoptosis axis in all tested cells. miR-126 differentially regulates HIF-1α/apoptosis expression in cardiac cells exposed to experimental I/R and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing myocardial resilience in the setting of myocardial infarction.",

The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of PCI with Sirolimus-Coated Balloons (SCB) and second-generation DES in this population. We included elderly patients who underwent PCI from the prospective, investigator-driven EASTBOURNE study (n= 534 patients treated with Magic Touch SCB) and the Complex Registry (n = 234 patients treated with second-generation DES). The primary endpoint was net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE), a composite of all-cause death, target lesion revascularization (TLR), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and major bleedings at the 2-year follow-up.

Prospective diagnostic study with central adjudication METHODS: Consecutive high-risk patients (age >65 years or known cardiovascular disease) undergoing arterial vascular surgery were included between 2014 and 2019. Cardiac complications including perioperative myocardial infarction/injury (PMI) were centrally adjudicated by two independent physicians. PMI aetiologies were hierarchically classified into \"extra-cardiac\", if caused by a primarily extra-cardiac disease such as severe sepsis or pulmonary embolism, or \"cardiac\", further subtyped into type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI), tachyarrhythmia, postoperative acute heart failure (pAHF), or likely type 2 myocardial infarction (LT2MI). All-cause death and MACE, including acute MI, pAHF, life-threatening arrhythmia, and cardiovascular death, were assessed during 1-year follow-up. Among 2'265 patients (median age 71 years, 27% female), PMI occurred in 423 (18.7%) with substantial heterogeneity. The highest incidence was seen after open thoracic, thoracoabdominal and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (42%) and the lowest after carotid endarterectomy (11%). Open and endovascular peripheral revascularization procedures were associated with PMI rates of 17% and 14%, respectively. Within 1 year, 267/2'265 patients (11.8%) died and at least one MACE occurred in 325/2'265 patients (14.3%).

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of phoenixin-14 (PNX-14) in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats, comparing both preventive and therapeutic administration. Seventy adult male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control, PNX-14, ISO, ISO + PNX-14 (PNX-14 treatment after ISO), and PNX-14 + ISO (PNX-14 pretreatment before ISO). MI was induced by subcutaneous ISO (100 mg/kg/day) for two days. PNX-14 (5 nmol/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered once daily for 3 days. Biochemical, molecular, and histopathological analyses were performed to evaluate oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in cardiac tissue. PNX-14 treatment significantly reduced the ISO-induced increases in heart/body weight ratio (0.54 ± 0.05), infarct size (47.3 ± 2.51 %), apoptotic index (40.8 ± 2.99 %), and cardiac necrosis markers CK-MB and TnI (p < 0.001). It improved antioxidant defenses by increasing glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant status (TAS), while reducing total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI). Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were lowered, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased. PNX-14 also attenuated apoptosis in cardiac tissue by downregulating cytochrome c, APAF-1, caspase-3, and Bax, and upregulating the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. These effects were linked to modulation of Gpr173, AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1, and Sema3E/PlexinD1 pathways, alongside suppression of JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, PNX-14 improved hemodynamic stability and histopathologically reduced ISO-induced myocardial damage. These results demonstrate that PNX-14, particularly when administered after injury, effectively attenuates myocardial damage through multi-pathway regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. PNX-14 may hold therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Documentation of perioperative bleeding during vascular procedures is crucial for monitoring efficacy, safety, and to evaluate patient outcomes. This study validated the European Multicenter Study on Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (E-CABG) bleeding classification for evaluating perioperative bleeding in patients undergoing open peripheral arterial surgery (OPAS). Prospective, multicentre cohort study including adult patients undergoing elective OPAS. Patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery were excluded to maintain a homogeneous bleeding risk profile. Primary outcome was the incidence of complications categorised per E-CABG grade. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive ability of Grade I or higher on patient outcomes. The model was adjusted for type of OPAS to minimise heterogeneity. A total of 778 patients were included. Ninety-four patients (12%) suffered a bleeding complication (Grade I: n=47, 6.0%; Grade II: n=47, 6.0%). Patients suffering Grade ≥ 1 had significantly more thrombo-embolic complications (TEC) (p<0.001), myocardial infarction (p=0.006), bowel ischemia (p<0.001), graft thrombosis (p=0.019), graft infection (p=0.026), wound infection (p<0.001), pneumonia (p = 0.024), prolonged duration of hospital admission (p<0.001), higher re-operation (p<0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) than patients without a bleeding complication. In a multivariate model, Grade ≥1 predicted 30-day mortality (AUC 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.96), re-operation other than bleeding (AUC 0.75, 95%CI 0.66-0.85), wound infection (AUC 0.76, 95%CI 0.72-0.80), and TEC (AUC 0.67, 95%CI 0.58-0.76). The E-CABG bleeding classification is applicable for stratifying the severity of perioperative bleeding in OPAS and predicting adverse short-term postoperative outcomes for research and registry databases.",

Understanding the structural and electrical properties of the scar and its surrounding tissue is essential for assessing arrhythmia risk. This study aimed to investigate the role of scar anatomy and border zone properties in predicting ventricular arrhythmias, using patient-specific three-dimensional models derived from medical imaging. The study involved 29 post-myocardial infarction patients. Comprehensive segmentation of the ventricles was performed to generate 3D models incorporating the scar, its core, and the border zone. Arrhythmia inducibility was assessed through in silico simulations using a clinical early-pacing protocol. Different configurations of the border zone were tested, varying fibroblast density and ionic current remodeling. Reentry was induced in 16 of the 29 virtual patients, 13 of whom also experienced clinical reentry. Conversely, the 13 virtual patients in whom reentry was not induced also did not show reentry clinically. The simulations demonstrated that varying fibrosis density within the same scar structure can lead to different arrhythmic scenarios. Key quantified parameters related to scar anatomy, including the extent of the border zone and conduction channels, were identified as strong predictors of arrhythmia risk. This study highlights the importance of scar anatomy in post-infarction arrhythmias and provides a novel approach to predicting arrhythmic risk. The findings support the use of patient-specific scar remodeling data for improving clinical risk assessments and guiding therapy to prevent future arrhythmias.",

We show that the occlusive portion of the thrombus consists of a thick, transverse cable spanning the channel width. The cable is made of hundreds of parallel strings of platelets joined by yarns of VWF fibers identified by immunofluorescence microscopy. The elements composing the occlusive structure - cable, strings, yarns, and fibers, listed in hierarchical order - are oriented in the direction of tension to confer high breakage strength and stability to resist the upstream pressure. This structural hierarchy supports VWF as a potential new target for the prevention and lysis of occlusive arterial thrombi.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) alters cardiomyocyte geometry and architecture, leading to changes in the acoustic properties of the myocardium. This study examines ultrasomics-a novel cardiac ultrasound-based radiomics technique to extract high-throughput pixel-level information from images-for identifying ultrasonic texture and morphologic changes associated with infarcted myocardium. The authors included 684 participants from multisource data: a) a retrospective single-center matched case-control dataset; b) a prospective multicenter matched clinical trial dataset; and c) an open-source international and multivendor dataset. Handcrafted and deep transfer learning-based ultrasomics features from 2- and 4-chamber echocardiographic views were used to train machine learning (ML) models with the use of leave-one-source-out cross-validation for external validation. The ML model showed a higher AUC than transfer learning-based deep features in identifying MI (AUC: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.84-0.89] vs AUC: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.70-0.77]; P < 0.0001). ML probability was an independent predictor of MI even after adjusting for conventional echocardiographic parameters (adjusted OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.01-1.05]; P < 0.0001). ML probability showed diagnostic value in differentiating acute MI, even in the presence of myocardial dysfunction (averaged longitudinal strain [LS] <16%) (AUC: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.77-0.89]). In addition, combining averaged LS with ML probability significantly improved predictive performance compared with LS alone (AUC: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.91] vs AUC: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]; P = 0.02). Visualization of ultrasomics features with the use of a Manhattan plot discriminated infarcted and noninfarcted segments (P < 0.001) and facilitated parametric visualization of infarcted myocardium. This study demonstrates the potential of cardiac ultrasomics to distinguish healthy from infarcted myocardium and highlights the need for validation in diverse populations to define its role and incremental value in myocardial tissue characterization beyond conventional echocardiography.",

This study aimed to assess the correlation between NID1 polymorphisms and the prognosis of heart failure (HF). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of NID1 polymorphisms with heart failure (HF). Methods A total of 1000 patients with HF were enrolled in the discovery cohort. Genotyping was conducted to assess the relationship between common variants in the NID1 gene and the prognosis of HF. A replication cohort involving 2266 HF patients was used to validate the association between variants and the prognosis of HF. A series of function analysis were conducted to illuminate the underlying mechanism. Results Synonymous variant rs3738530 was identified to be associated with the prognosis of HF in both the discovery cohort (adjusted P = 0.006, HR = 1.58, 95% CI= 1.14-2.19) and replication cohort (adjusted P = 0.005, HR = 1.83, 95% CI= 1.20-2.80). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein level of NID1 was significantly higher in the rs3738530-T allele compared to the A allele (P < 0.05). Transcription assays indicated that individuals with the rs3738530-AT+TT genotype exhibited elevated levels of NID1 mRNA relative to those with the AA genotype. Apoptosis assay indicated that overexpression of NID1 could protect AC16 cells from H/R-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, patients with rs3738530-AT+TT genotype exhibited a higher left ventricular ejection fraction and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter compared to those with rs3738530-AA genotype (P< 0.05).

    "abstract": "Blood vessels play a crucial role in supplying tissues with oxygen and nutrients. The maintenance of normal blood vessel number and integrity requires a continuous supply of new endothelial cells (ECs) through self-replication. While it is established that ECs across different tissues exhibit heterogeneity in molecular signatures and regenerative capacities, the extent of proliferation heterogeneity among ECs within the same organ or tissue remains largely unexplored. An EC-specific proliferation tracing system was developed to investigate the proliferative heterogeneity of ECs in the heart, liver, and lung. A combination of RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing was used to uncover the underlying mechanisms of this heterogeneity. An MAPK signaling inhibitor was administered in vivo to functionally assess pathway involvement. Injury models, including transverse aortic constriction, myocardial infarction, partial hepatectomy, and pneumonectomy, were utilized to assess stress-induced EC proliferation. EC proliferation exhibits marked intraorgan heterogeneity. In the heart, ECs in the upper part of the ventricular septum, the superior-inner left ventricle wall, and the apex showed elevated proliferation. In the liver, E-CAD (e-cadherin)±1 liver sinusoidal EC displayed a distinct proliferative advantage. In the lung, PLVAP (plasma membrane vesicle-associated protein)+ ECs renew more actively than CAR4 (carbonic anhydrase 4)+ ECs. Multiomics analysis revealed regional transcription diversity. In vivo MAPK inhibition confirmed its role in regulating EC proliferative heterogeneity. This study uncovers regional and subtype-specific proliferation in the heart, liver, and lung, driven by distinct gene expression programs. These findings highlight the spatial and functional diversity of microvascular ECs and offer a framework for developing organ-specific vascular regenerative strategies.",

We sought to compare procedural and clinical outcomes after orbital atherectomy (OA) versus intravascular lithotripsy (IVL)-facilitated PCI in patients with CNs. We identified patients with optical coherence tomography (OCT)-defined CNs who underwent PCI with either OA or IVL between 2012 and 2022 and had both pre- and post-PCI OCT images available. The imaging end point was the minimal stent area on final post-PCI OCT. The clinical end point was 2-year target-lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target-lesion revascularization. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio and 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score matching, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, diabetes, and pre-PCI calcium burden assessed by OCT (length, arc, and thickness). Among 4856 patients with evaluable pre- and post-PCI OCT images, 493 patients (10.2%) had CNs, and 167 patients underwent PCI with either OA (n=83) or IVL (n=84). The 2 groups had similar baseline demographic and lesion characteristics.

The severity of poisoning is dependent upon environmental and human factors, with hypoxia and oxidative stress being important mechanisms of cardiac toxicity induced by CO. Myocardial involvement is common in moderate to severe ACMP, including myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and sudden death, which are associated with a high risk of death. Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO), although ferroptosis has been shown to play a critical role in various cardiovascular diseases, the potential mechanism by which it contributes to ACMP-induced myocardial injury is unclear. This review discusses the established link between ferroptosis and cardiovascular disease and summarizes the potential role of ferroptosis in ACMP-induced myocardial injury and the detrimental effects of ACMP on the heart. Elucidating these mechanisms could guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target ferroptosis to mitigate ACMP-induced myocardial injury.

Individuals who underwent noncardiac surgical procedures were identified within the perioperative medicine database (INSPIRE 1.1) and stratified into tertiles on the basis of the CAR. The associations between the CAR and the risk of MACEs (all-cause death, perioperative myocardial infarction, and acute heart failure) were analysed via Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and restricted cubic splines were subsequently used to examine the shape of the associations. Additionally, the CAR's incremental predictive value for MACEs was evaluated using the C statistic, continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), in order to quantify the improvement in predictive performance achieved by adding the CAR to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). The feature significance and predictive models were developed via the Boruta algorithm and machine learning techniques. A total of 7,366 patients were included. There was a significant difference in the perioperative MACE risk among the three groups (tertiles 1 to 3: 0.24% vs. 0.69% vs. 1.63%; log-rank P < 0.001).

In hypoxia-cultured murine endothelial cells (ECs), hypoxia was observed to inhibit EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. In contrast, overexpression of ATF4 ameliorated these hypoxia-induced impairments. Conversely, inhibition of ATF4 further exacerbated the reduction in EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation induced by hypoxia. Notably, the beneficial effects of ATF4 were reversed by the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002. Under hypoxic conditions, ATF4 overexpression significantly upregulated phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, p-AKT (T308), and p-AKT (S473) in ECs. LY294002, however, markedly reduced the expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT (T308), and p-AKT (S473) in hypoxic ECs overexpressing ATF4. In a murine MI model, ATF4 overexpression partially mitigated cardiac dysfunction and promoted neovascularization, effects that were significantly attenuated by LY294002. These findings suggest that ATF4 plays a crucial role in endothelial cell-mediated neovascularization under post-MI hypoxia by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Optimal antiplatelet therapy is crucial in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to balance thrombotic and bleeding risk. Cangrelor, a rapid-acting intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, is particularly effective in high-risk PCI scenarios, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or patients unable to take oral medications. The SMILE study evaluated real-world timing, indications, and outcomes of cangrelor use, along with transition to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, in high-risk patients undergoing PCI. A retrospective analysis of Mount Sinai PCI registry was conducted, examining consecutive patients receiving cangrelor from January 2018 to March 2024. Transition to oral P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor, clopidogrel, or prasugrel) followed institutional protocols based on guidelines and expert consensus. The primary endpoint was in-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause death. Among 493 patients, 78.7% presented with ACS (29.6% STEMI; 14.8% cardiogenic shock) and 79.3% underwent complex PCI. Of these, 80.5% were subsequently transitioned to ticagrelor (N=397) and 19.5% to a thienopyridine (clopidogrel N=85, prasugrel N=11). MACCE incidence was 12.6%, while bleeding occurred in 4.3%. A lower risk of MACCE was associated with transition to ticagrelor (9.8% vs. 24.0%; adjusted OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.20-0.62, p < 0.001) and adherence to protocol for transition to oral P2Y12 inhibitors (10.9% vs. 19.4%; adjusted OR 0.51, 95%CI 0.28-0.94). Extended low-dose cangrelor infusion was well-tolerated in critically ill patients requiring prolonged parenteral antiplatelet therapy. Overall, the SMILE study demonstrated that adherence to standardized transition protocols enhances clinical outcomes in high-risk PCI patients receiving cangrelor, particularly when transitioned to ticagrelor. Further research is needed to validate these results across diverse populations and clinical settings.",

    "title": "Low HDL-The Challenge.",
    "abstract": "The main function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is to remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from blood vessels through reverse cholesterol transport. In addition, HDL has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Low HDL level is an independent risk factor for development of coronary artery disease. To manage patients with low HDL levels, general measures such as lifestyle modification, controlling acute metabolic syndrome, and participating in regular endurance exercise are essential. Smoking cessation is a must, and it will often improve HDL levels by 5% to 10%. While statin therapy is the backbone therapy for controlling LDL levels, it also results in elevation of HDL levels by at least 5%. Specific pharmacologic interventions to improve HDL level and function have been disappointing. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the key metabolic pathway to transfer HDL to LDL; thus, CETP inhibitors result in elevation of HDL levels. Several products were tested in large controlled studies, such as dalcetrapib and evacetrapib; neither resulted in any clinical benefit. Anacetrapib only resulted in very limited benefit and is no longer under active development. The most recent study utilized apolipoprotein A1 infusion in high-risk patients shortly after acute myocardial infarction. There was no benefit in the primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. In patients with low HDL, a strategy of having LDL as low as can be possibly achieved may be the most appropriate approach.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) is a major contributor to poor prognosis following revascularization in myocardial infarction patients, yet targeted therapies remain elusive. While hesperidin methyl chalcone (HMC) demonstrates antioxidant and vasoprotective properties, its role in modulating regulated cell death pathways during MI/RI is undefined. This study investigates the cardioprotective effects of HMC against MI/RI and its underlying mechanisms. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) models in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and a model of MI/RI in mice were employed. The effects of HMC on cardiac performance, copper flux analysis, ubiquitination assays and molecular docking, mitochondrial integrity and cell death modalities in response to MI/RI were examined. HMC pretreatment exhibited significant cardioprotection, reducing infarct size and improving cardiac function in MI/RI mice. Mechanistically, HMC specifically attenuated cuproptosis, as evidenced by decreased copper overload and downregulation of cuproptosis effectors, mimicking the action of the copper chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM). Crucially, the cuproptosis inducer elesclomol-Cu (Es-Cu) abolished the cardioprotective effects of HMC. Furthermore, HMC interacted with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF7, and disrupted the complex of MARCHF7/ATP7A, thereby reducing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the copper exporter ATP7A. The stabilization of ATP7A enhanced copper efflux, alleviating cuproptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial damage induced by MI/RI. Our work unveils a ubiquitin-regulated copper homeostasis axis in MI/RI. By targeting MARCHF7-ATP7A interaction, HMC sustains copper export machinery to combat cuproptosis-driven injury. These findings position HMC as a novel therapeutic candidate for MI/RI through regulating ubiquitination-dependent regulation of copper homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a critical heart disease with a high mortality rate, posing a serious risk to human health. Injectable hydrogels possess considerable therapeutic promise for managing MI through the application of tissue-engineered scaffolds for cell delivery. However, the oxidative stress microenvironment of MI lesions leads to low cell retention and survival. In this study, a thermo-sensitive resveratrol micelles (RES-M) loaded chitosan hydrogel (RM-CH) was developed against oxidative stress injury in cardiomyocytes (CMs). RM-CH had better scavenging ability against DPPH and ABTS radicals compared to industry-standard ascorbic acid. RM-CH had good biodegradability, histocompatibility and cytocompatibility. The injection process of the hydrogel did not cause cell injury. DHE and DCFH-DA staining showed that it can improve the survival of CMs by fighting against the oxidative stress microenvironment. Live/Dead staining of CMs in hydrogels showed that the addition of RES-M could rescue cell survival under oxidative stress. Hence, this work highlights the potential clinical applications of RM-CH which may present an ideal scaffold material for injectable cardiac tissue engineering.",

As TAVR is increasingly used in younger patients with longer life expectancy, there is greater emphasis on preserving access to coronary arteries due to the potential for ischemic events. Limited data exist on the actual frequency of these events following TAVR. Data were collected from 4750 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, from the multicenter OBSERVANT-I and OBSERVANT-II studies. The primary endpoint was hospitalization due to cardiac ischemic events within 5 years after TAVR. Outcomes were adjudicated using administrative databases and reported as cumulative incidence, accounting for the competing risk of death. At 5 years, 8.3 % (95 % CI:7.5-9.1 %) of patients experienced cardiac ischemic events, with the incidence increasing over time. The types of ischemic events included chronic coronary syndrome (3.3 %; 95 % CI:2.8-3.9 %), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (2.6 %; 95 % CI:2.1-3.1 %), unstable angina (2.3 %; 95 % CI:1.9-2.8 %), and STEMI (0.9 %; 95 % CI:0.7-1.3 %). Unplanned coronary angiography was performed in 5.0 % (95 % CI:4.4-5.7 %) of patients, and percutaneous coronary intervention in 2.6 % (95 % CI:2.1-3.1 %).

Through this review, it was shown that biomedical scientists must prevent activities during the pre-analysis stage that may lead to fibrin formation. When such situations become inevitable due to various reasons, including patients' predispositions, several steps were outlined to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of hs-cTn in myocardial infarction. The importance of technological advancements in detecting fibrin and other potential sources of cross-reactivity or interference was also identified through a comparative analysis of some auto-analysers, proposing possible solutions to address these pitfalls as a means of promoting efficiency and quality assurance in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction through high-sensitivity troponin assays.

This retrospective cohort study used the Research Network of the TriNetX platform to compare outcomes between patients with systemic sclerosis prescribed with SGLT2 inhibitors versus those without SGLT2i prescription, using data from January 1, 2013, to May 6, 2025. Following propensity score matching, each cohort included 1,402 patients with balanced baseline characteristics (standardized mean differences <0.2). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included first-time heart failure diagnosis, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization, stroke, cardiac arrest, and chronic kidney disease. SGLT2i prescription was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.66), stroke (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96), and hospitalization (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.86).

MB was defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or 5 bleeding events. MACE was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, urgent target vessel revascularization, or new-onset/decompensated heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30%. Clinical data and outcomes were extracted from hospital records and independently adjudicated.MB occurred in 4.5% of patients (n = 37). The incidence of in-hospital MACE was significantly higher among patients with MB compared to those without (40.5% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, MB was the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital MACE (OR: 12.43, 95% CI: 3.43-44.98, p < 0.001), followed by reduced LVEF (OR per % increase: 0.794, 95% CI: 0.747-0.843, p < 0.001), age, and white blood cell count.In-hospital MB is a potent and independent predictor of early MACE in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

Baseline frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale, with patients categorized as frail or nonfrail. Frailty progression and diabetic foot ulcer-related outcomes were monitored, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with frailty development. The mean age was 55.4 years; 67% of patients were female, 35% had peripheral artery disease, and 13% had end-stage kidney disease.

Patients with severe AS, an aortic annulus diameter of < 21 mm on echocardiography, a mean annulus diameter of < 23 mm, and an area ≤ 4.3 cm2 on cardiac computed tomography, who underwent TAVI, were retrospectively analyzed. The frequency of low-gradient severe AS was assessed. Patients were followed up for the occurrence of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, rehospitalizations for heart failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Among 230 patients with severe AS and a small aortic annulus (age 82 ± 6 years, 85% female), 52 (23%) had low gradient, while 120 (52%) exhibited normal flow-high gradient and 58 (25%) had low flow-high gradient. During a median follow-up of 2 years, the composite endpoint occurred in 29% of the total cohort. Patients with low-gradient severe AS experienced the worse outcome (HR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.13-5.33; p = 0.023). Almost one-fourth of patients with severe AS and small annulus have low gradient AS. These patients experienced worse outcomes, likely reflecting advanced myocardial remodeling due to delayed referral and the diagnostic challenges posed by small annular dimensions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of Elabela peptide (ELA) levels in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with cardiac chest pain to investigate the efficacy of ELA in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Our single-center, prospective study involved NSTEMI patients admitted to ED between June 2023 and June 2024. Serum ELA levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercial kits. The performance of the ELA in predicting MACE and discriminating the NSTEMI group was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 119 patients participated in this study: 64 NSTEMI patients and 55 controls. There was a weak and statistically significant correlation between the high-sensitive cardiac troponin T value at admission and the ELA levels. The median ELA value of the group with and without MACE was 954 and 811 pg/ml, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between these groups (p = 0.049). The ability of the ELA value to predict 30-day MACE was assessed using ROC analysis, yielding an AUC of 0.652 (95% CI 0.523-0.767). The optimal cut-off point for ELA based on the Youden Index was > 962 pg/ml (sensitivity: 48.84%; specificity: 90.48%; positive likelihood ratio 5.13; negative likelihood ratio 0.57). In conclusion, we propose that ELA can assist in the early diagnosis of NSTEMI patients presenting to ED with chest pain and may be an effective and supportive biomarker for predicting MACE.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we compared the incidence of short-term outcomes between two groups of patients based on the occurrence of intra-procedural slow-flow/no-reflow phenomenon (SF/NR) and identified predictors of short-term outcomes. This study enrolled a consecutive series of patients diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of SF/NR, and the incidence of short-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was compared between the two groups. Furthermore, the study aimed to identify predictors of short-term mortality in these patients. A total of 2582 patients were included, of whom 79.1% (n=2042) were male. The average age of the patients was 55.7 ± 11.2 years. Intra-procedural SF/NR was observed in 21.7% (560) of the patients. During median short-term follow-up of 180 days (144-205), patients with SF/NR exhibited a higher incidence of all-cause mortality (23.6% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.001) and MACE (30.4% vs. 16.9%; p < 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 1.82 (1.46-2.27; p < 0.001) and 1.69 (1.39-2.05; p < 0.001), respectively. Among patients with SF/NR, the following were found to be independent predictors of short-term mortality (adjusted odds ratios): total ischemic time, 1.04 (1.00-1.07; p = 0.041); random blood sugar levels, 1.01 (1.00-1.01; p < 0.001); intubation status, 2.79 (1.26-6.18; p = 0.011); post-procedural sub-optimal flow, 1.76 (1.04-2.98; p = 0.034); and intra-procedural arrhythmias, 5.48 (2.03-14.79; p < 0.001). The presence of intra-procedural SF/NR has significant prognostic implications. Patients with intra-procedural SF/NR face a significantly higher risk of short-term adverse outcomes. HINTERGRUND: In der vorliegenden Studie wurden, basierend auf dem Auftreten eines intraprozeduralem Slow-Flow‑/No-Reflow-Phänomens (SF/NR), die Inzidenz kurzfristiger Ereignisse zwischen 2 Gruppen von Patienten verglichen und Prädiktoren der Ereignisse identifiziert. Dazu wurde eine Reihe aufeinanderfolgender Patienten mit der Diagnose eines ST-Hebungs-Infarkts (STEMI) in diese Studie aufgenommen, bei denen eine primäre perkutane Koronarintervention (PCI) durchgeführt wurde. Die Patienten wurden in 2 Gruppen aufgeteilt, je nach Vorliegen oder Nichtvorliegen von SF/NR, und es erfolgte ein Vergleich der Inzidenz kurzfristig auftretender schwerwiegender unerwünschter kardiovaskulärer Ereignisse (MACE) zwischen den beiden Gruppen. Darüber hinaus war es Ziel der Studie, Prädiktoren der kurzfristigen Mortalität bei diesen Patienten zu identifizieren. Von den 2582 in die Studie einbezogenen Patienten waren 79,1% (n=2042) männlich. Das Durchschnittsalter der Patienten betrug 55,7 ± 11,2 Jahre. Ein intraprozedurales SF/NR-Phänomen wurde bei 21,7% (560) der Patienten beobachtet. Während eines mittleren kurzfristigen Follow-up-Zeitraums von 180 Tagen (144–205) wiesen Patienten mit SF/NR eine höhere Inzidenz bei der Gesamtmortalität (23,6 vs. 12,3%; p < 0,001) und MACE auf (30,4 vs. 16,9%; p < 0,001), dabei betrug die Hazard Ratio 1,82 (1,46–2,27; p < 0,001) bzw. 1,69 (1,39–2,05; p < 0,001). Bei den Patienten mit SF/NR wurden folgende Faktoren als unabhängige Prädiktoren der kurzfristigen Mortalität identifiziert (adjustierte Odds Ratio): totale Ischämiezeit: 1,04 (1,00–1,07; p = 0,041); zufällige Blutzuckerwerte: 1,01 (1,00–1,01; p < 0,001); Intubationsstatus: 2,79 (1,26–6,18; p = 0,011); postprozeduraler suboptimaler Durchfluss: 1,76 (1,04–2,98; p = 0,034); und intraprozedurale Arrhythmien: 5,48 (2,03–14,79; p < 0,001). Das Vorliegen eines intraprozeduralen SF/NR-Phänomens hat signifikante prognostische Bedeutung. Patienten mit intraprozeduralem SF/NR-Phänomen weisen ein signifikant höheres Risiko kurzfristiger unerwünschter Ereignisse auf.",

There is limited data regarding the occurrence of coronary events post-TAVR and the adverse outcomes. This study aimed to establish the prevalence, mortality rate, and predictive factors of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) post-TAVR. A systematic literature search was conducted via PubMed, SCOPUS, and Ovid SP to retrieve studies reporting the incidence of ACS following TAVR. Pooled incidence and pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using the generic inverse variance method. A total of 10 studies involving 462,060 patients underwent TAVR and 11,402 patients diagnosed with ACS following TAVR were included in this meta-analysis. The incidence of ACS following TAVR was 1.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8-4.2%]. Further analysis demonstrated that the incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina was 8.9% (95% CI: 5.2-14.7%), 77.6% (95% CI: 59.0-89.3%), and 18.0% (95% CI: 2.6-63.8%), respectively. Notably, 33.5% (95% CI 13.1-62.8%) of the patients were managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. The mortality rate was 11.1% (95% CI: 7.1-17.2%). History of percutaneous coronary intervention (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.67) and diabetes (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.43) were predictors of development of ACS after TAVR.

    "abstract": "To compare transient ischemic attack (TIA), transient global amnesia (TGA), and transient ischemic attack with lesions found in magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion-weighted imaging (MRI-DWI) scans, in order to find similarities and differences in their clinical picture. Magnetic resonance imaging scans account for a substantial part of the financial burden associa-ted with cerebrovascular events. Finding initial clinical features that differentiate transient brain ischemic events will be useful in developing standardized procedures for selecting patients who require further radiological imaging, thereby reducing overall costs. A total of 9701 patients hospitalized in two major tertiary hospitals in the Silesian voivodeship in Poland between January 2016 and July 2024 with a diagnosis of TGA, TIA, and ischemic stroke were analyzed. The final group consisted of 947 patients, who were further divided into three categories: 425 TIA (44.87%), 125 TGA (13.19%), and 387 TIA with MRI-DWI lesions (41.92%). The data of patients were statistically analyzed. Patients with transient focal symptoms and confirmed DWI lesions in MRI scans were significantly older. They were more likely to have coronary heart disease, had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, more severe symptoms, and were less likely to receive antiplatelet treatment than TGA and TIA patients. Transient global amnesia patients had higher systolic blood pressure on admission compared to other groups. The presence of DWI-MRI lesions is associated with a higher initial clinical burden. Our results confirm that the lack of stroke prevention therapies may have determined the more severe course of the vascular event. This study supports a sudden rise in blood pressure being a contributing factor in TGA patients. Older patients with TIAs, having several vascular risk factors, but lacking prevention therapies are likely to present with cerebral lesions on DWI-MRI. These patients should undergo additional imaging procedures.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of Yiqi Liangxue Shengji prescription (, YQLXSJ) on cardiac function and outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and to determine its clinical efficacy. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled hospitalized patients with AMI who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and experienced MIRI either intraoperatively or postoperatively. Participants were randomly allocated to the treatment group, which received YQLXSJ, or the control group, which received a placebo, concurrent with standard Western Medicine therapy. The intervention period lasted 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), determined by echocardiography. Secondary outcomes included N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels, left ventricular internal diameter, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), angina pectoris scores, and Chinese medicine evidence scores. Following 8 weeks of intervention, the treatment group demonstrated a significant increase in LVEF and a marked reduction in NT-proBNP when compared to the control group. There was also a significant decrease in peak cTnI levels, Chinese medicine evidence scores, and angina pectoris scores. The control group's left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) significantly increased compared to baseline after 8 weeks (P < 0.05), whereas the treatment group's LVESD showed no significant change from baseline (P > 0.05). Although the treatment group showed a downward trend in MACE incidence compared to the control group, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated that the addition of YQLXSJ to standard therapy can improve cardiac function and alleviate clinical symptoms in AMI patients with MIRI, and also showed a potential to mitigate the incidence of MACE. Furthermore, YQLXSJ displayed a favorable safety profile in clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death among non-communicable diseases globally. Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most significant CVDs resulting from acute or chronic myocardial ischemia, which can lead to irreversible damage. Despite the substantial burden posed by these conditions, specific treatments remain limited to symptomatic management. ApoEFrag has been shown to be protective in the CNS. However, the cardioprotective potential of ApoE-mimetic has not been investigated. Thus, this study investigates the cardioprotective potential of ApoEFrag, a novel ApoE-mimetic peptide, in an acute MI model in rats. MI was induced in rats through two doses of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg via subcutaneous injection) administered 24 h apart. ApoEFrag was given at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg to ISO-treated rats. Following treatment, we measured electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and arterial and ventricular pressure functions using the PV-loop system. Plasma and heart samples were collected for biochemical assessments, including plasma injury markers, hypertrophic index parameters, inflammatory markers, gene/protein expression analysis, and histopathological studies. ISO-induced MI resulted in alterations in ECG patterns, ventricular dysfunction, increased fibrosis, and elevated hypertrophic index parameters. Additionally, ISO administration led to increased inflammatory markers and oxidative stress levels, which were reversed by the ApoEFrag treatment. Furthermore, ApoEFrag significantly ameliorated cardiac injury, inflammation, hypertrophic index parameters, ECG alterations, ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac fibrosis in ISO-induced MI models. Notably, ApoEFrag also improved mitochondrial health. This study suggests that ApoEFrag has significant cardioprotective potential in an acute myocardial infarction model.",

    "abstract": "The associations between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and specific cardiovascular events, as well as their attributable burdens, remain inconsistent and underexplored within a single population. This large-scale prospective cohort evaluated the associations between MASLD and various cardiovascular outcomes. Two additional steatotic liver disease (SLD) subtypes - MASLD with increased alcohol consumption (MetALD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) - were also evaluated. We included 303,589 adults aged ≥30 years from Taiwan who underwent health examinations between 1997 and 2013. MASLD was defined by ultrasound-detected steatosis, limited alcohol intake, and ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor. MetALD and ALD were defined based on alcohol intake thresholds and cardiometabolic profiles. Participants were followed until 2020, with outcomes and mortality ascertained via linkage to national registries. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs), and population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated. Of the total population, 91,877 (30.3%) had MASLD, 7,490 (2.5%) had MetALD, 5,576 (1.8%) had ALD, and 198,646 (65.4%) did not have SLD. Over a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 162,959 cardiovascular events occurred. The adjusted RR of any cardiovascular diseases was 1.29 (95% CI 1.38-1.31) for MASLD, 1.38 (95% CI 1.34-1.42) for MetALD, and 1.48 (95% CI 1.43-1.53) for ALD. Among all SLD subtypes, MASLD showed the highest RR for myocardial infarction (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.56). Findings remained consistent after accounting for liver-related deaths. The PAF for MASLD was 8.07% (95% CI 7.81-8.58). Despite higher risks, MetALD and ALD had lower PAFs due to lower prevalence. All major SLD subtypes - MASLD, MetALD, and ALD - were associated with increased long-term cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for early detection and cardiometabolic risk management across the SLD spectrum. This large-scale study of 303,589 individuals demonstrates that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases by at least 29%. Cardiovascular risk further escalates across SLD subtypes with higher levels of alcohol consumption. Notably, MASLD was associated with the highest risk of myocardial infarction among all SLD subtypes. By quantifying population burden, we found that 8.07% of cardiovascular events may be preventable through effective MASLD prevention strategies, highlighting the critical role of cardiometabolic risk management. These findings emphasize the need to integrate MASLD identification and prevention into broader cardiometabolic care and public health frameworks. not applicable.",

Different blood pressure subtypes may have varying associations with cardiovascular events, but evidence remains inconclusive in the working population. The objective of the study was to evaluate the incidence and differences between hypertension and prehypertension subtypes in the development of cardiovascular events in an occupational cohort. A retrospective cohort study including 12,027 workers monitored over 8 years. The outcome variable was the development of CVD, including myocardial infarction and/or stroke. Hypertension subtypes were classified as normotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg), isolated systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg), isolated diastolic hypertension (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and systolic-diastolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). Prehypertension subtypes were defined as isolated systolic prehypertension (SBP 120 - 139 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg), isolated diastolic prehypertension (SBP < 120 mm Hg and DBP 80 - 89 mm Hg), and systolic-diastolic prehypertension (SBP 120 - 139 mm Hg and DBP 80 - 89 mm Hg).

Neither isolated diastolic nor systolic-diastolic prehypertension and hypertension showed significant associations.

    "abstract": "Guidelines recommend exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) 2 - 3 times per week. However, this high number of visits per week to outpatient CR can be a burden that lowers patient compliance. Home-based exercise is a key for patients to perform a sufficient volume of exercise. But we sometimes need to be careful in patients who has coronary artery stenosis. Wearable activity trackers would be useful for maintaining an appropriate intensity and sufficient volume of home-based exercise. A 65-year-old male patient who did not have unremarkable past medical history had chest pain and visited our hospital. The primary diagnosis was acute myocardial infarction and the culprit lesion which was 99% stenosis in the posterior descending artery of the left circumflex artery was successfully treated. He was also diagnosed with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia and had residual 75% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. He was started pharmacotherapy and planned elective percutaneous coronary intervention after 5 months. He was required an exercise-based CR after discharge. Outpatient CR was scheduled for once a week and he needed additional home-based exercise. We used a wearable activity tracker (iAide2-W, TOKAI Corp, Gifu, Japan) to check appropriate intensity of exercise and maintain a sufficient volume for home-based exercise. This device was able to monitor the metabolic equivalent by an acceleration sensor by telemetry. We could check the intensity of exercise at a specialized online site. Thanks to this device, he was able to reduce the body weight and increase the exercise tolerance without any chest pain. The percent predicted oxygen intake per body weight increased from 84% to 95% at the anaerobic threshold and from 68% to 83% at the peak. After 5 months, he treated the residual stenosis successfully. Wearable activity trackers can be used to evaluate biological information in daily life and are expected to be useful for CR.",

A total of 120 male mice were randomly divided into six groups: sham, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R group), VPreC (vericiguat, 3 mg/kg, administered intravenously 12 hr before ligation), VPreC+HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) (geldanamycin, 1 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally 30 min before ligation), VPostC (vericiguat, 3 mg/kg, administered intravenously ten minutes before reperfusion), and VPostC+GA (geldanamycin, 1 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally 20 min before reperfusion). The remaining five groups were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by two hours of reperfusion. The sizes of myocardial infarction, rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and levels of myocardial markers were measured. In addition, the protein expressions of HSP90, TLR4, JNK, BAX, and B-lymphoblastoma-2 (Bcl-2) were detected, along with the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors. Vericiguat significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarct size, apoptosis rate, and myocardial marker release. Alongside these positive effects, there was an increase in HSP90 and Bcl-2 expression, as well as a decrease in TLR4, JNK, BAX expression, and inflammatory factor levels. However, the HSP90 inhibitor GA reversed these protective and anti-inflammatory effects. HSP90 mediates the cardioprotective effects of vericiguat, potentially by inhibiting TLR4, JNK activation, and inflammatory responses.",

The association of OxPL-apoB to expression of CD62P, CD41, or PAC-1 levels and intrinsic and on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity to collagen and ADP was determined. The relationship of OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) to myocardial infarction-free survival and all-cause mortality at a median of 7 years was assessed using Cox regression models. Elevated levels of OxPL-apoB were associated with the severity of coronary obstruction, and higher prevalence of prior myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. No significant associations were present between OxPL-apoB and intrinsic or on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity or activation of platelet receptors. Analyzed individually in separate multivariable models, both OxPL-apoB (hazard ratio, 1.022 [95% CI, 1.005-1.040]; P=0.010) and Lp(a) (hazard ratio, 1.002 [95% CI, 1.000-1.005]; P=0.032) were associated with worse myocardial infarction-free survival. However, in a joint multivariable model analyzed together, neither OxPL-apoB nor Lp(a) was significant. The optimal cut point for myocardial infarction-free survival for OxPL-apoB was 8 nmol/L (hazard ratio, 1.391 [95% CI, 1.086-1.780]; P=0.009) and for Lp(a) 30 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 1.261 [95% CI, 1.012-1.570]; P=0.038). In patients undergoing coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, OxPL-apoB was not associated with intrinsic and on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity mediated by collagen or ADP. The association of OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) suggests that the accumulation of OxPL on Lp(a) may be a key determinant of long-term cardiovascular outcomes.

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with impaired collateralization, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. This study explored the immune cell dynamics in patients with type 2 diabetes with chronic total occlusion and their impact on collateralization. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted from patients with type 2 diabetes with chronic total occlusion, exhibiting either good or poor collateralization. Single-cell RNA sequencing was conducted to profile the quantitative and transcriptomic dynamics of immune cells in these 2 groups. Moreover, coculture experiments were executed, and ischemic models of the hindlimb and myocardium were induced in diabetic mice to corroborate the single-cell RNA sequencing findings. Additional validation was attained by conducting an analysis on a separate cohort of patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified elevated levels of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in patients with poor collateralization. In diabetic mice, inhibition of MAIT cell activation significantly improved angiogenesis under ischemic conditions. In vitro, MAIT cell-derived CCL3L1 drove macrophage polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype through CCR5 interaction. Furthermore, an independent patient cohort confirmed that elevated MAIT cell levels represent an independent risk factor for poor collateralization. These findings highlight the critical role of MAIT cells in regulating collateralization in type 2 diabetes chronic total occlusion patients and propose circulating MAIT cell levels as a potential biomarker for predicting and intervening in poor collateralization.",

    "abstract": "Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) necessitates timely treatment to improve outcomes. Identifying treatment delays across different South Asian countries can aid in formulating policies to reduce these delays. Objectives: To estimate the average treatment delay in AMI patients in South Asia and identify contributing factors. Using the CoCoPop framework (Condition, Context, Population), studies were reviewed on AMI treatment delays in South Asia from 2000 to 2022. Databases searched included PubMed Central, Embase and Google Scholar. Eligible studies were cross-sectional and analytical that reported exact delay times, excluding knowledge, attitude, practice studies, narrative reviews, and case reports. The search yielded 2954 records, with 42 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The pooled median prehospital delay was 531 minutes (95% CI: 366-769 minutes). The pooled mean door-to-ECG time was 9.18 minutes (95% CI: 2.52-15.84 minutes). The door-to-needle and door to balloon time among STEMI patients were 37.95 (95% CI: 30.11-45.78 minutes) minutes and 62.92 minutes (95% CI: 45.28-80.56 minutes), respectively with significant heterogeneity. Factors associated with delays included old age, female gender, low literacy, ignorance, financial constraints, and rural location. Significant treatment delays for AMI patients in South Asia are identified, with socio-economic and logistical barriers contributing to these delays. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), also known as heart attack, needs timely treatment to save lives and improve recovery. Identifying treatment delays in South Asia guides policies to effectively reduce such delays. Studies published between 2000 and 2022 from countries in South Asia were reviewed. It was observed that patients had delays of an average of 531 minutes (nearly 9 hours) to reach the hospital after symptoms began. Once at the hospital, it took around 9 minutes for patients to get an ECG. For patients with a serious heart artery blockage (STEMI) the average time taken from reaching the hospital to starting medicine to break the clot (medicine given through a drip to open blocked arteries) was about 38 minutes. On average, the time taken to reach and start treatment with a heart balloon procedure was about 63 minutes. These times varied widely between studies. Several factors caused delays in treatment, including older age, being female, low education levels, not knowing heart attack symptoms, financial problems, and living in rural areas. This study shows that many people in South Asia experience long delays before getting treatment for heart attacks. Reducing these delays through public awareness, improved transport, and hospital readiness could help save more lives.",

    "abstract": "Drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment has shown outcomes comparable to drug-eluting stent (DES) in small vessel coronary disease. However, evidence for its application in large vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) remains limited. This study evaluated the clinical impact of DCB-based percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with large vessel CAD. We retrospectively enrolled 550 consecutive patients with reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.0 mm treated with DCB-based PCI and propensity-matched them 1:1 to 550 patients who underwent conventional PCI with second-generation DES (DES-only group). The primary endpoint was 2-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, definite target lesion thrombosis, and target vessel revascularization (TVR). In the DCB-based group, 390 patients (70.9%) were treated with DCB alone. Total device length was higher in the DCB group (40.0 ± 23.3 vs. 35.4 ± 23.3 mm; p = 0.001), whereas mean implanted stent length was shorter (9.6 ± 18.4 vs. 35.4 ± 23.3 mm; p < 0.001). The cumulative 2-year incidence of MACE was significantly lower after DCB-based PCI than after DES-only PCI (4.3% vs. 9.7%; hazard ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: 0.26 to 0.70; p = 0.001). TVR was also lower in DCB-based PCI (3.4% vs. 7.5%; hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.81; p = 0.008). There was no difference in cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding. In patients with large vessel CAD, DCB-based PCI strategy was associated with a significant reduction in MACE compared with DES-only PCI at 2-year follow-up, primarily driven by a lower rate of TVR.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the most common cardiovascular diseases and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In recent years, natural polymeric patches have attracted increasing attention as a promising therapeutic platform for myocardial tissue repair. This study explored the fabrication and evaluation of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) on chitosan film as a novel platform for cardiac patch applications. Chitosan is a biodegradable and biocompatible natural polymer that provides an ideal substrate for SPEs, providing mechanical stability and promoting cell adhesion. Silver ink was employed to enhance electrochemical performance, and the electrodes exhibited strong adhesion and structural integrity under wet conditions. Mechanical testing and swelling ratio analysis were conducted to assess the patch's physical robustness and aqueous stability. Silver ink was employed to enhance electrochemical performance, which was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry. In vitro, electrical stimulation through the chitosan-SPE patch significantly increased the expression of cardiac-specific genes (GATA-4, β-MHC, troponin I) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), indicating early cardiogenic differentiation potential. In vivo, the implantation of the chitosan-SPE patch in a rat MI model demonstrated good tissue integration, preserved myocardial structure, and enhanced ventricular wall thickness, indicating that the patch has the potential to serve as a functional cardiac scaffold. These findings support the feasibility of screen-printed electrodes fabricated on chitosan film substrates as a cost-effective and scalable platform for cardiac repair, offering a foundation for future applications in cardiac tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Platelet activity contributes to myocardial infarction; inadequate inhibition is a risk factor for stent thrombosis and mortality. Inadequate platelet inhibition during treatment is an important risk factor for stent thrombosis and may be associated with increased mortality. This study assessed platelet and coagulation activity in post-MI patients, identifying parameters associated with adverse ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) outcomes over 3 years, to identify patients needing intensive secondary prevention. Methods: From 57 admitted patients, 19 STEMI patients were analyzed. Thromboelastography (TEG) and Total Thrombus Formation Analysis System (T-TAS) were used to assess hemostasis and coagulation. Selected laboratory parameters were measured for correlations. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, thrombosis, and death from cardiovascular causes. Results: The group with MACEs was characterized by a faster time to initial clot formation and greater reflection of clot strength. T-TAS parameters, such as area under the curve at 10 min (T-TAS AUC10), showed lower values in the same group of patients. A moderate positive correlation suggested that as white blood cell count increases, T-TAS AUC10 values also tend to increase. A strong negative correlation (rho = -1.000, p < 0.01) was observed between low-density lipoprotein and kinetics in the TEG using the kaolin test at baseline in patients with MACEs. Conclusions: Some of the parameters suggest they are associated with adverse outcomes of STEMI, indicate the existence of an inflammatory state, and may contribute to risk stratification of STEMI patients and identify who will require ongoing monitoring.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether MHO status is associated with different rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) during HFpEF-related hospitalizations compared to patients without MHO. Methods: Data from the 2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was analyzed using relevant ICD-10 codes to identify HFpEF admissions in older adults. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to generate balanced cohorts of patients with and without MHO. Multivariable adjustments were performed to assess primary outcomes, including MACCEs, all-cause mortality (ACM), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (CA), and stroke. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Each MHO cohort included 22,405 patients with a median age of 75 years. The MHO+ group demonstrated a significantly higher risk of dysrhythmia (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21-1.43, p < 0.001). Interestingly, an \"obesity paradox\" was observed, as the MHO+ cohort had lower odds of MACCEs (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.81, p < 0.001), ACM (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.82, p < 0.001), and AMI (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86, p = 0.001) compared to MHO-. No significant differences were found for CA or stroke between the groups. Conclusions: Although the MHO+ group had an elevated risk of dysrhythmia, they exhibited more favorable outcomes in terms of MACCEs, ACM, and AMI-supporting the concept of an \"obesity paradox.\" Further research is needed to better understand the role of MHO as a comorbid condition in patients with HFpEF.",

Surgical LAA exclusion (LAAE) can be performed and must be complete to avoid increased thrombus formation. Methods: This prospective, multi-center, post-market study (NCT05101993) evaluated the long-term safety and performance of the epicardial V-shape AtriClip device. Patients ≥18 years who had received V-shape AtriClip devices during non-emergent cardiac surgery consented to a prospective 12-month follow-up visit and LAA imaging. The primary performance was LAAE without residual left atrium-LAA communication, assessed by imaging at the last follow-up visit. The primary safety was device- or implant procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs) (death, major bleeding, surgical site infection, pericardial effusion requiring intervention, myocardial infarction) within 30 days. Results: Of 155 patients from 11 U.S. centers, 151 patients had evaluable imaging. Complete LAAE was obtained in all patients.

    "abstract": "Background: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is useful for detecting acute myocardial infarction, but chronic hemodialysis patients often have elevated baseline levels that exceed the upper reference limit (URL). This study aimed to determine whether hs-cTnI levels in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients exceed the URL established for the general population, evaluate the impact of high-flux hemodialysis on hs-cTnI concentrations, and examine associations between hs-cTnI levels and subsequent hospitalization or mortality. Methods: A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center from August 2023 to July 2024. Blood samples for hs-cTnI were collected from asymptomatic hemodialysis patients aged ≥ 40 years, measured before and after dialysis within one month. Patients were followed for up to 12 months. Results: Fifty-six patients were enrolled. The mean hs-cTnI levels were 28.4 ng/L pre-dialysis and 27.9 ng/L post-dialysis, with ranges of <6-223 ng/L and <6-187 ng/L, respectively. The mean hs-cTnI delta between pre- and post-dialysis was -0.5 ng/L, with 52% showing a negative delta, 30% no change, and 18% a positive delta. No association was found between baseline hs-cTnI levels and mortality or hospitalization during follow-up. Conclusions: Most asymptomatic hemodialysis patients had hs-cTnI levels in the \"gray zone\", thus neither confirming nor excluding acute myocardial infarction. Dialysis did not significantly affect hs-cTnI levels, and elevated baseline hs-cTnI was not linked to increased mortality or hospitalization over 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a standard physiological index for guiding coronary revascularization, with a threshold of >0.80 typically used to defer intervention. However, due to its distinct anatomical and physiological features, the left anterior descending artery (LAD) often exhibits lower FFR values than non-LAD vessels for lesions of similar angiographic severity. These vessel-specific differences raise concerns about applying a uniform FFR cutoff across all coronary territories. Observational studies indicate that LAD lesions deferred at an FFR of 0.80 may have similar or better outcomes than non-LAD lesions do. LAD lesions also tend to show lower post-percutaneous coronary intervention FFR values, suggesting that vessel specific target thresholds may be more prognostically appropriate. Additionally, some evidence suggests that instantaneous wave-free ratio may offer greater prognostic value than FFR, specifically in LAD lesions, a trend not consistently seen in other arteries. In patients with acute myocardial infarction and multivessel disease, the prognostic relevance of non-culprit lesion FFR may vary by coronary territory, particularly in the LAD. This review outlines the physiological rationale and clinical evidence for vessel-specific interpretation of FFR, with a focus on the LAD, and explores its potential clinical implications and limitations.",

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2021. Patients aged ≥ 35 years with a history of smoking and a diagnosis of COPDe were included. Patients with CKD stage 5, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), heart failure decompensation, urinary tract infections, myocardial infarction, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or active COVID-19 infection were excluded. Baseline demographics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to measure the odds ratio (OR) of mortality. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics V.30, with statistical significance at p < 0.05. Results: Among 405,845 hospitalized COPDe patients, 13.6% had AKI. These patients were older, had longer hospital stays, and included fewer females and White patients. AKI was associated with significantly higher mortality (OR: 2.417), more frequent acute respiratory failure (OR: 4.559), intubation (OR: 10.262), and vasopressor use (OR: 2.736).

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (Medline) and Embase. This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and applied the PICO criteria. Results: A total of 110 articles were analyzed, comprising 2,328,417 patients with moderate to severe coronary calcified lesions treated with RA, conventional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or other advanced interventions. The pooled incidence of short- to mid-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) was 6% (95% CI 4-7%), increasing to 17% (95% CI 15-21%) at 6 months. Mortality was 2% (95% CI 1-3%) within 6 months, rising to 7% (95% CI 6-9%) thereafter. RA significantly increased the risk of long-term MACEs, mortality, total lesion revascularization (TLR), bleeding, and fluoroscopy time, and was borderline associated with an increased risk of short-term myocardial infarction and a reduced risk of coronary dissection. RA and other invasive procedures showed similar risks for short-term MACEs, mortality, total vascular revascularization (TVR), stent thrombosis, heart failure, stroke, and inflammation. Conclusions: RA is linked to higher long-term risks of MACEs, mortality, TLR, bleeding, and fluoroscopy time compared to other interventions. While RA shows comparable outcomes for short-term MACEs and mortality with other procedures, it may slightly reduce the risk of coronary dissection. These findings underscore the importance of careful patient selection and weighing long-term risks when considering RA for calcified coronary lesions.",

Background: LVEF is a key prognostic marker in cardiovascular disease, but its value across different clinical indications for CA remains insufficiently characterized. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing CA between January 2016 and August 2022 were retrospectively included at one institution. Patients were stratified into four LVEF groups: ≥ 55%, 45-54%, 35-44%, and <35%. The primary endpoint was rehospitalization for heart failure (HF) at 36 months. Secondary endpoints were acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and coronary revascularization. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted within the entire study cohort and pre-defined subgroups. Results: A total of 6888 patients were included (median age: 71 years; 65.2% males). LVEF < 35% was associated with a higher comorbidity burden and more extensive coronary artery disease (e.g., three-vessel CAD: 38.6% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001). Event rates for HF rehospitalization and AMI increased progressively with declining LVEF, while revascularization rates varied across categories. Statistically significant differences across LVEF groups were observed for all three endpoints in unadjusted analyses (log-rank p < 0.001). In multivariable models, LVEF < 35% independently predicted HF rehospitalization (HR = 3.731, p < 0.001) and AMI (HR = 4.184, p < 0.001), but not revascularization (HR = 0.867, p = 0.378). The prognostic association was demonstrated across all subgroups stratified by age, sex, subtype of acute coronary syndrome, and CAD severity. Conclusions: Reduced LVEF is an independent predictor of HF rehospitalization and AMI in patients undergoing coronary angiography, irrespective of its indication, whereas no independent association was observed with coronary revascularization.",

Recent innovations in imaging modalities, pharmaceuticals and interventional techniques have revolutionized diagnostic and treatment options, necessitating the reevaluation of established drug protocols or the consideration of newer alternatives. The utilization of beta blockers (BBs) in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), shifting from the pre-reperfusion to the thrombolytic and finally the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) era, has become increasingly more selective and contentious. Nonetheless, the extent of myocardial necrosis remains a key predictor of outcomes in this patient population, with large trials establishing the beneficial use of beta blockers. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) has emerged as a highly effective diagnostic tool for delineating the coronary anatomy and atheromatous plaque characteristics, with the added capability of MESH-3D model generation. Induction and preservation of a low heart rate (HR), regardless of the underlying sequence, is of critical importance for high-quality results. Landiolol is an intravenous beta blocker with an ultra-short duration of action (t1/2 = 4 min) and remarkable β1-receptor specificity (β1/β2 = 255) and pharmacokinetics that support its potential for systematic integration into clinical practice. It has been increasingly recognized for its importance in both acute (primarily studied in STEMI and, to a lesser extent, NSTEMI pPCI) and chronic (mainly studied in elective PCI) CAD settings. Given the limited literature focusing specifically on landiolol, the aim of this narrative review is to examine its pharmacological properties and evaluate its current and future role in enhancing both diagnostic imaging quality and therapeutic outcomes in patients with CAD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several blood biomarkers have shown a major role in predicting major adverse complications (MACs) in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. Here, we aimed to investigate the possible role of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum albumin ratio (BAR) and the inflammatory prognostic index (IPI) in predicting major adverse complication after surgical aorta valve replacement (SAVR). Methods: The clinical, echocardiographic, and clinical-chemistry laboratory data of 195 patients who underwent SAVR were evaluated. The post-surgical MACs (death, surgical re-exploration, myocardial infarction and cerebral ischemia) during the hospitalization were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were studied by comparing the basic clinical features, echocardiographic parameters, and patients' hematological indices between patients with or without MACs. Results: The mean age was 66.1 years, and 62.5% were males. Logistic regression analysis showed that the left atrium volume (LAV), BAR, and IPI as either continuous or categorical variables were independently associated with MACs. Moreover, we found a combined effect of higher LAV with a higher value of BAR or IPI. Combined higher levels of LAV and BAR increased the risk of developing MACs by 9.8 (CI 95% = 2.8-34.3, p = 0.0003), while higher values of LAV and IPI increased the risk of developing MACs by 4.5. Conclusions: Higher levels of BAR and IPI, alone or in combination with higher LAVs, showed an independent predictive value of MACs after SAVR. These findings strongly support the importance of evaluating easily available biomarkers of the pre-operative status of patients in order to predict adverse outcomes.",

    "title": "The Role of Advanced Glycation End-Products in the Pathophysiology and Pharmacotherapy of Cardiovascular Disease.",
    "abstract": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are formed by the non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids due to the consumption of high-carbohydrate diets; their production is also promoted by a sedentary lifestyle as well as cigarette smoking. Elevated levels of AGEs in the circulatory system and internal organs of the body are commonly observed in a number of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, which are associated with the development of oxidative stress and myocardial inflammation. The adverse effects of AGEs on the cardiovascular system are elicited by both non-receptor mechanisms involving the cross-linking of extracellular and intracellular proteins, and by receptor-mediated mechanisms involving the binding of AGEs with advanced glycation end-product receptors (RAGEs) on the cell membrane. AGE-RAGE interactions along with the cross-linking of proteins promote the generation of oxidative stress, the production of inflammation, the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+-overload, and alterations in the extracellular matrix leading to the development of cardiovascular dysfunction. AGEs also bind with two other protein receptors in the circulatory system: soluble RAGEs (sRAGEs) are released upon the proteolysis of RAGEs due to the activation of matrix metalloproteinase, and endogenous secretory RAGEs (esRAGEs) are secreted as a spliced variant of endogenous RAGEs. While the AGE-RAGE signal transduction axis serves as a pathogenic mechanism, both sRAGEs and esRAGEs serve as cytoprotective interventions. The serum levels of sRAGEs are decreased in ischemic heart disease, vascular disease, and heart failure, as well as in other cardiovascular diseases, but are increased in chronic diabetes and renal disease. Several interventions which can reduce the formation of AGEs, block the AGE-RAGE axis, or increase the levels of circulating sRAGEs have been shown to exert beneficial effects in diverse cardiovascular diseases. These observations support the view that the AGE-RAGE axis not only plays a critical role in pathogenesis, but is also an excellent target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

    "title": "HGF Overexpression in Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Based Cell Sheets Enhances Autophagy-Dependent Cytoprotection and Proliferation to Guard the Epicardial Mesothelium.",
    "abstract": "Epicardial mesothelial cells (EMCs), which form the epicardium, play a crucial role in cardiac homeostasis and repair. Upon damage, EMCs reactivate embryonic development programs, contributing to wound healing, progenitor cell amplification, and regulation of lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. However, the mechanisms governing EMC activation and subsequent regulation remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic regulator of various cellular functions, could modulate EMC activity. To verify this hypothesis, we developed HGF-overexpressing mesenchymal stromal cell sheets (HGF-MSC CSs) and evaluated their effects on EMCs in vitro and in vivo. This study has revealed, for the first time, that EMCs express the c-Met (HGF receptor) on their surface and that both recombinant HGF and HGF-MSC CSs secretome cause c-Met phosphorylation, triggering downstream intracellular signaling. Our findings demonstrate that the HGF-MSC CSs secretome promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions by modulating the level of autophagy. At the same time, HGF-MSC CSs stimulate EMC proliferation, promoting their amplification in the damage zone. These data demonstrate that HGF-MSC CSs can be considered a promising regulator of epicardial cell activity involved in heart repair after ischemic damage.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis following myocardial infarction plays a critical role in the formation of scar tissue and contributes to ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. Current clinical diagnostics use electrical and structural markers, but lack precision due to low spatial resolution and absence of molecular information. In this paper, we employed line scan Raman microspectroscopy to classify sheep myocardial tissue into muscle, necrotic, granulated, and fibrotic tissue types, using collagen as a molecular biomarker. Three spectral regions were evaluated: region A (600-2960 cm-1), region B (600-1399 cm-1 and 1751-2960 cm-1), and region C (1400-1750 cm-1), which includes the prominent collagen-associated peaks at 1448 cm-1 and 1652 cm-1. Linear and nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machines (SVMs) were applied for dimensionality reduction and classification, with nonlinear models specifically addressing the nonlinearity of collagen formation during fibrogenesis. Histological validation was performed using Masson's trichrome staining. Raman bands associated with collagen in region C consistently outperformed regions A and B, achieving the highest explained variance and best class separation in both binary and multiclass PCA models for both linear and nonlinear approaches. The ratio of collagen-related peaks enabled stage-dependent tissue characterization, confirming the nonlinear nature of fibrotic remodeling. Our findings highlight the diagnostic potential of collagen-associated Raman bands for characterizing myocardial fibrosis. The proposed PCA-SVM framework demonstrates robust performance even with limited sample size and has the potential to lay the foundation for real-time intraoperative diagnostics.",

Although recent advances have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of ACS and its primary consequence, myocardial infarction, many questions remain regarding the molecular and cellular changes occurring during and after an infarction. This study aimed to evaluate the expression levels of the zyxin (ZYX) gene in patients with ACS, stable coronary artery disease (stable CAD), and healthy controls. RNA was extracted from PBMCs and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene expression was measured using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays and the number of ZYX mRNA molecules was quantified based on qRT-PCR kinetics. Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare gene expression levels among the three groups. A significantly higher number of ZYX gene copies was observed in both the ACS and stable CAD groups than in healthy controls (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively). A statistically significant difference was also observed between the ACS and stable CAD groups (p = 0.004). The increased expression of zyxin observed in patients with ACS and stable CAD may reflect cellular repair mechanisms activated in response to myocardial injury.",

    "abstract": "In the original randomised Dietary Intervention to Stop Coronary Atherosclerosis (DISCO-CT) trial, a 12-month Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) project led by dietitians improved cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and reduced platelet chemokine levels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). It is unclear whether these benefits are sustained. To determine whether the metabolic, inflammatory, and clinical benefits achieved during the DISCO-CT trial are sustained six years after the structured intervention ended. Ninety-seven adults with non-obstructive CAD confirmed in coronary computed tomography angiography were randomly assigned to receive optimal medical therapy (control group, n = 41) or the same therapy combined with intensive DASH counselling (DASH group, n = 43). After 301 ± 22 weeks, 84 individuals (87%) who had given consent underwent reassessment of body composition, meal frequency assessment, and biochemical testing (lipids, hs-CRP, CXCL4, RANTES and homocysteine). Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed. During the intervention, the DASH group lost an average of 3.6 ± 4.2 kg and reduced their total body fat by an average of 4.2 ± 4.8 kg, compared to an average loss of 1.1 ± 2.9 kg and a reduction in total body fat of 0.3 ± 4.1 kg in the control group (both p < 0.01). Six years later, most of the lost body weight and fat tissue had been regained, and there was a sharp increase in visceral fat area in both groups (p < 0.0001). CXCL4 decreased by 4.3 ± 3.0 ng/mL during the intervention and remained lower than baseline values; in contrast, in the control group, it initially increased and then decreased (p < 0.001 between groups). LDL cholesterol and hs-CRP levels returned to baseline in both groups but remained below baseline in the DASH group. There was one case of MACE in the DASH group, compared with four cases (including one fatal myocardial infarction) in the control group (p = 0.575). Overall adherence to the DASH project increased by 26 points during counselling and then decreased by only four points, remaining higher than in the control group. A one-year DASH project supported by a physician and dietitian resulted in long-term suppression of the proatherogenic chemokine CXCL4 and fewer MACE over six years, despite a decline in adherence and loss of most anthropometric and lipid benefits. It appears that sustained systemic reinforcement of behaviours is necessary to maintain the benefits of lifestyle intervention in CAD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mobile health applications have emerged as a novel tool to support secondary prevention after myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the impact of app-based interventions on clinically meaningful outcomes such as hospital readmissions remains uncertain. Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone app-based interventions in reducing unplanned hospital readmissions among post-MI/PCI patients. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed was conducted for randomized controlled trials published between January 2020 and April 2025. Eligible studies evaluated smartphone apps designed for secondary cardiovascular prevention and reported on unplanned hospital readmissions. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on follow-up duration and user adherence. Results: Four trials encompassing 827 patients met inclusion criteria. App-based interventions were associated with a significant reduction in unplanned hospital readmissions compared to standard care (RR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.23-0.89; p = 0.0219). Greater benefits were observed in studies with longer follow-up durations and higher adherence rates. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality of life, were also documented. Heterogeneity was moderate. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were reported in only two studies and were not analyzed due to inconsistent definitions and low event rates. Conclusions: Smartphone applications for post-MI/PCI care are associated with reduced unplanned hospital readmissions and improved patient-reported outcomes. These tools may play a meaningful role in future cardiovascular care models, especially when sustained engagement and personalized features are prioritized.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The identification of cardiovascular risk factors in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) patients prior to the initiation of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) is important yet challenging. Methods and Results: A nationwide cohort study was conducted utilizing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database containing the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The study population comprised 4739 PCa patients who received abiraterone or enzalutamide between 1 January 2014, and 28 February 2022. The cohort was divided into a training set (n = 3318) and a validation set (n = 1421). Machine learning techniques with random survival forest (RSF) model incorporating 16 variables was developed to predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Over a mean follow-up period of 2.1 years, MACEs occurred in 10.9% and 11.3% of the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The RSF model identified five key predictive indicators: age < 65 or ≥75 years, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. The model exhibited robust performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 85.1% in the training set and demonstrating strong external validity with an AUC of 85.5% in the validation cohort. A positive correlation was observed between the number of risk factors and the incidence of MACEs. Conclusions: This machine learning approach identified five predictors of MACEs in PCa patients receiving ARPIs. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and vigilant monitoring in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite advances in coronary artery disease (CAD) treatment, challenges persist, particularly in complex lesions. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is widely used, its outcomes can be affected by complications like restenosis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), offering higher-resolution imaging than angiography, shows promise in guiding PCI. However, meta-analytical comparisons between OCT-guided and angiography-guided PCI remain limited. Methods: Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, were queried through May 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OCT-guided PCI with angiography-guided PCI. Data were pooled using risk ratios (RRs) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a random-effects model. Results: Five RCTs involving 5737 patients (OCT: 2738 and angiography: 2999) were included. On pooled analysis, OCT-guided PCI was associated with a notable reduction in major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (RR: 0.71, p = 0.0001), cardiac mortality (RR: 0.43, p = 0.003), target lesion revascularization (TLR) (RR: 0.53, p = 0.007), and stroke (RR: 0.17, p = 0.02), compared to angiography-guided PCI. No significant differences were noted for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Conclusions: In patients with complex coronary lesions, OCT-guided PCI reduces the risk of MACE, cardiac mortality, TLR, and stroke, compared to angiography-guided PCI only. This study supports incorporating advanced imaging techniques like OCT to improve clinical outcomes, especially in complex PCIs.",

Baseline data include indices of humoral and cellular immunity (CD59, CD16, IL-10, CD14, CD19, CD8, CD4, etc.), cytokines and markers of cardiovascular disease, inflammatory markers (TNF, GM-CSF, CRP), growth and angiogenesis factors (VEGF, PGF), proteins involved in apoptosis and cytotoxicity (perforin, CD95), as well as indices of liver function, kidney function, oxidative stress and heart failure (albumin, cystatin C, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), C-reactive protein (CRP), cholinesterase (ChE), cholesterol, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)). Clinical and behavioural risk factors were also considered: arterial hypertension (AH), previous myocardial infarction (PICS), aortocoronary bypass surgery (CABG) and/or stenting, coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), atrioventricular block (AB block), and diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity level), education, and body mass index (BMI). Methods: The study included 52 patients aged 65 years and older. Based on the clinical, biochemical and immunological data obtained, a model for predicting the risk of premature cardiovascular aging was developed using mathematical modelling and machine learning methods. The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model allowing for the early detection of predisposition to the development of CVDs and their complications. Numerical methods of mathematical modelling, including Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashforth and backward-directed Euler methods, were used to solve the prediction problem, which made it possible to describe the dynamics of changes in biomarkers and patients' condition over time with high accuracy. Results: HLA-DR (50%), CD14 (41%) and CD16 (38%) showed the highest association with aging processes. BMI was correlated with placental growth factor (37%). The glomerular filtration rate was positively associated with physical activity (47%), whereas SOD activity was negatively correlated with it (48%), reflecting a decline in antioxidant defence. Conclusions: The obtained results allow for improving the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction, and form personalised recommendations for the prevention and correction of its development.",

Two cohorts were derived: HF patients with/without T2DM and T2DM patients with/without HF, by linking the Swedish HF Registry, the National Diabetes Registry and other national registries in 2017-2021. In 37,903 patients with HF (35% females, median age 74), T2DM was independently associated with a 10-fold higher use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and less likely use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) irrespective of ejection fraction (EF), and of renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASi)/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi) in HF with reduced and mildly reduced EF. Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years, T2DM was independently associated with higher risk of first HF hospitalization (HHF)/cardiovascular death, first HHF, and all-cause death, but not with cardiovascular death alone. In 16,266 patients with T2DM (29% females, median age 76), HF was independently associated with more likely use of SGLT2i but less likely use of metformin. Over a median follow-up of 2.2 years, HF was independently associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and myocardial infarction. In HF, T2DM was associated with higher use of SGLT2i and lower use of MRA and RASi/ARNI despite being linked with a higher risk of death and HHF. In T2DM, presence of HF was linked with higher SGLT2i use, and an independent higher risk of death and myocardial infarction. HF was associated with comparatively greater risk increase than T2DM. This study examined how the coexistence of heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) affect each others treatment patterns and associated patient outcomes, analyzing data from Swedish health registries between 2017 and 2021. Among patients with HF, those with T2DM were more likely to use sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a class of drugs beneficial for both conditions. However, these patients were less likely to use other HF medications, such as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASi), and having T2DM was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Less use of medications might be related to fear of side effects and clinical inertia, which should be overcome.In patients with T2DM, the presence of HF was associated with more likely use of SGLT2i and less likely use of metformin. The presence of HF was associted with a higher risk of cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and myocardial infarction as compared with HF alone.These findings aim to raise clinicians' awareness for the need of treatment optimization in patients with both HF and T2DM, since they have higher risk of clinical events.",

The gut microbiome influences CVD, through atherogenic metabolites like trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) or protective effects through short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production. The specific alterations in the gut microbiome and downstream metabolites in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) remain unclear. We enrolled ACS patients within 24 h of clinical presentation with a follow-up of 28 days, using CCS patients as controls. Gut microbiome composition, downstream metabolites, and cardiovascular function were assessed at both baseline and follow-up. Microbiome-derived metabolites were analyzed and gut microbiome samples were characterized by 16S rRNA gene analysis. We enrolled 40 patients, with 20 patients each in the ACS and CCS group. Alpha diversity of the microbiome did not differ throughout the follow-up. After ACS gut microbiome composition changed during the follow-up period with increased levels of Butyricicoccus and Butyricoccaceae, a pattern not observed in the CCS cohort. Downstream analysis of microbiome-derived metabolites SCFA revealed increased serum levels of butanoic acid, while TMAO levels remained unchanged. This small prospective observational non-randomized study, suggests that ACS may trigger an enrichment of butanoic acid-producing bacteria in the gut microbiome, accompanied by an increase in serum butanoic acid levels over 28 days. No significant changes in TMAO were observed. These insights could help develop approaches to reduce the burden of CVD.

Despite the potential for adverse outcomes associated with blood transfusion, the risks related to this procedure in RA patients remain underexplored, particularly within the framework of a large-scale national dataset. This study analyzed data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2010 to 2019, identifying 66,674 patients diagnosed with RA who underwent LEJR. These cases were subsequently divided into two groups based on whether they received blood transfusion. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on patient demographics, the prevalence of comorbidities, hospital-level characteristics, total financial charges, insurance coverage, and in-hospital mortality rates. The cumulative blood transfusion rate among RA patients undergoing LEJR was 10.9%, showing a declining trend over the study period (from 23.79% in 2010 to 3.67% in 2019). Several factors were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving blood transfusion, including advanced age (≥ 65 years), female sex, deficiency anemia, chronic blood loss anemia, weight loss, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders, pulmonary circulatory disturbances, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and uncomplicated diabetes. Moreover, patients who received blood transfusion demonstrated a higher risk of specific complications, including wound infection, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, postoperative delirium, deep vein thrombosis, lower limb nerve injury, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Thorough preoperative assessment is essential for identifying RA patients who were more likely to receive blood transfusion and be subjected to adverse outcomes. Proactive interventions during the perioperative period, coupled with the implementation of a comprehensive blood management strategy, can optimize blood transfusion in RA patients after LEJR.",

This prospective cohort study investigated the synergistic prognostic impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in 1396 ACS patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention at Fuwai Hospital (2017-2020). Using deep targeted sequencing (42 genes, median depth 14,219 ×), we identified CHIP mutations (VAF ≥ 2%) in 14.5% of participants, with DNMT3A (23.7%), TET2 (2.8%), and ASXL1 (1.9%) being most prevalent. High-AIP patients stratified by cutoff value were younger (57.8 vs. 63.2 years), had elevated hs-CRP (7.2 vs. 5.8 mg/L), and higher smoking rates, suggesting accelerated atherosclerosis. Multivariable Cox regression revealed that in patients with AIP ≥ cutoff, CHIP carriers exhibited significantly higher all-cause mortality, particularly for TET2 mutations (HR 5.20, CI 95%: 1.75-15.41; p = 0.003) and TET2/ASXL1 co-mutations (HR 5.5, CI 95%: 2.02-13.15; p = 0.001). Among individuals in the high AIP group, any CHIP (Fig. 3A, HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.18-4.81; P log-rank = 0.015) and common CHIP (Fig. 3B, HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.30-5.08; P log-rank = 0.008) mutation experienced a higher risk of mortality than individuals absence of CHIP mutation. These findings establish AIP as a critical modifier of CHIP-related cardiovascular risk, potentially through enhanced inflammatory pathways in younger ACS populations. The study highlights the clinical utility of combining lipid-based (AIP) and genetic (CHIP) biomarkers for precision prognostication, though validation in larger cohorts and mechanistic investigations of the AIP-CHIP interplay are warranted to guide targeted therapies.",

Its intracardiac mechanism and role of catheter ablation is under-determined. The current study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of catheter ablation for refractory ventricular tachycardia in early AMI. Between 2022 to 2024, 12,835 consecutive patients with AMI were screened and VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) was developed in 261(2.0%) patients, among them 51 (19.5%) were identified as refractory VT storm necessitating intensive intervention and finally 19 patients received bailout ablation for incessant VT. Their clinical, electrophysiological characteristics and outcomes were collected and analyzed. For these 19 patients underwent rescue ablation, VT was developed at a median of 4 days after the onset of AMI and became incessant two days after the first VT occurrence, despite revascularization, antiarrhythmic agents, sedation and hemodynamic support. Through intracardiac mapping, VT were all identified as scar-related reentry within the territory of the culprit artery. The endocardial mappable cycle length was 65.3±7.6% to total cycle length. Energy delivery at the either component of critical isthmus from endocardium successfully eliminated VT and no foci trigger was observed after VT termination. Subsequent substrate modification was performed around the termination site. After the index procedure, recurrent sustained VT was documented in 2 and one patient received repeated ablation. After a total of 20 procedures, VTs were all well subsided after the index procedure in all except for one patient who died of cerebral hemorrhage. The remaining patients were discharged alive. After a median of 18-month follow-up, one patient developed recurrent VF, and no sudden cardiac death occurred. Scar-related reentry is responsible for refractory VT early after AMI and ablation at critical isthmus is effective in VT suppression. Its indication and optimal timing of catheter ablation should be evaluated in prospective analysis.",

This study compared their predictive values for mortality and arrhythmic events in patients with reduced ejection fraction following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We analyzed 1933 AMI patients with reduced ejection fraction from the MIMIC-IV database (v3.1, 2008-2022). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, with secondary endpoints including 1-year all-cause mortality, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), and cardiac arrest. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated associations with in-hospital outcomes, while Cox proportional hazards models assessed 1-year mortality. Restricted cubic spline models examined non-linear relationships between SHR and outcomes, with discriminative ability compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Among patients (mean age 67.3 years), 401 (20.7%) died during hospitalization and 662 (34.2%) within one year. After adjustment, SHR showed the strongest association with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.82) compared to GV (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01). For 1-year mortality, SHR maintained superior performance (hazard ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.19-1.65), with the highest tertile significantly associated with increased risk. ROC analysis confirmed SHR's superior predictive capacity for both mortality endpoints and VT/VF, while none of the indices significantly predicted cardiac arrest. SHR's predictive value was more pronounced in non-diabetic patients. In post-AMI patients with reduced ejection fraction, SHR demonstrated superior predictive value for mortality compared to GV, supporting its incorporation into risk stratification models for individualized glucose management.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major global health threat, necessitating rapid and sensitive detection strategies. Herein, we report a signal-on quantum dot photoelectrochemical (QD-PEC) biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), based on a MoS2/NbS2 nanoheterojunction constructed via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The petal-like MoS2/NbS2, uniformly grown with atomic precision, offers a high surface area and efficient charge transport, serving as an ideal scaffold for dense CdTe QD loading. The strong interfacial coupling between MoS2/NbS2 and CdTe QDs enhances photogenerated charge separation and suppresses recombination, yielding significantly improved photocurrent response. Comprehensive structural, optical, and electrochemical characterizations confirm the integrity and superior photoactivity of the heterostructure. The resulting PEC biosensor exhibits a broad linear detection range (10-16 to 10-9 M) and an ultralow detection limit of 6 × 10-17 M for cTnI, along with excellent stability and selectivity, offering a promising platform for early MI diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Objective Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers (BBs) are commonly prescribed for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, the target blood systolic pressure (SBP) or pulse rate (PR) in these patients has not been established. This study aimed to assess the association between SBP/PR control at discharge and the clinical outcomes in patients with NSTEMI. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 596 patients with NSTEMI who received both ACEis/ARBs and BBs at discharge. Patients were categorized into a good control group (SBP ≤130 mmHg and PR ≤80 bpm, n=379) and poor control group (SBP >130 mmHg or PR >80 bpm, n=217). The primary endpoint was major cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure readmission. Results During a median follow-up of 1,267 days, 205 MACEs occurred. Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher MACE rates in the poor control group than in the good control group (p=0.003). A multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed that the good control group was inversely associated with MACEs (hazard ratio 0.748, 95% confidence interval: 0.561-0.997, p=0.048) after controlling for confounding factors. Conclusion Good control of SBP and PR was inversely associated with long-term adverse events in patients with NSTEMI who received both ACEis/ARBs and BBs. This study highlights the significance of optimizing medication titrations at discharge.",

    "abstract": "Patients with coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) within multiple layers of stent pose a specific clinical challenge because of higher rates of recurrent restenosis as well as a desire to avoid an additional layer of stent. Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) provide an alternative antiproliferative therapeutic option for multilayer ISR. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a low-dose paclitaxel-coated vs uncoated balloon among patients with multilayer or single-layer ISR in the AGENT IDE (A Clinical Trial to Assess the Agent Paclitaxel Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter for the Treatment of Subjects With In-Stent Restenosis) trial. AGENT IDE is a prospective, multicenter trial that randomized patients with ISR (reference vessel diameter >2.0 mm to ≤4.0 mm and lesion length <26 mm) in a 2:1 allocation to paclitaxel-coated or an uncoated balloon following successful lesion preparation. Randomization was stratified by multi- vs single-layer ISR as well as by center. The primary study endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF): composite occurrence of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac death. Of the 600 patients randomized in the trial, multilayer ISR was present in 258 (44%) patients. Patients with multilayer ISR had higher rates of TLF at 1 year compared with those with single-layer ISR (29.0% vs 15.7%, P < 0.0001). The overall study results were consistent irrespective of multilayer vs single-layer ISR (Pinteraction = 0.66). Among patients with multilayer ISR, TLF was lower with paclitaxel-coated balloon compared with an uncoated balloon (23.8% vs 40.0%; HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.87; P = 0.01), driven by reductions in both TLR and target vessel-related MI. Similar findings were observed among patients with single layer ISR (1-year TLF: 13.5% with paclitaxel-coated vs 20.2% with uncoated balloon; HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.37-1.11; P = 0.11), although absolute event rates were lower. Patients with ISR of multiple stent layers had higher rates of adverse stent-related events compared with patients with single-layer ISR. Treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon led to greater absolute risk reduction in 1-year TLF among patients with multilayer ISR compared with an uncoated balloon.

This study is a single-centre, nested case-control study, conducted in Tianjin, China. An international cardiovascular hospital. A total of 1524 patients, with a mean age of 64 (9) years, who underwent isolated elective CABG surgery were reviewed. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. EuDKA cases were identified by reviewing laboratory examination results until discharge, including arterial blood gas analysis and urine samples. Logistic regression analysis was used in a case-control design to identify potential risk factors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)-associated euDKA. Post-discharge follow-up was conducted through regular outpatient visits. 15 patients with euDKA, all with type 2 diabetes, were identified post-surgery, 13 of whom were SGLT2i users. The cumulative incidence of euDKA within 7 days after surgery was 1% in the cohort, increasing to 7.6% among those who discontinued SGLT2i 1-6 days (n=171) before surgery. A case-control study added seven additional confirmed euDKA patients to the case group, resulting in 20 cases and 95 controls. Univariate regression analysis revealed that the risk of euDKA was 7.304 times higher (95% CI 2.517 to 21.197; p<0.001) for patients who took their last dose within 3 days prior to surgery compared with patients who discontinued SGLT2i 3-6 days before surgery. During the intraoperative period, pH <7.35 (OR: 7.017, 95% CI 1.849 to 26.638; p=0.004) and blood glucose <10 mmol L-1 (OR: 6.882, 95% CI 1.822 to 25.997; p=0.004) were associated with a higher risk of euDKA.

This cohort study highlights a notable incidence of euDKA following CABG, particularly among patients using SGLT2i. Close monitoring in the ICU is recommended for patients with intraoperative abnormal blood glucose and pH levels to prevent euDKA.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) in chronic ischemic heart failure (HF) are associated with high mortality and often refractory to β-blocker treatment, highliting the need for alternative therapeutic targets. This study investigates the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a neurotransmitter released during sympathoexcitation, in the pathogenesis of VAs associated with ischemic chronic HF following myocardial infarction (MI). Using a mouse model of ischemic chronic HF after coronary ligation, we employed biochemical, electrophysiological, and calcium (Ca2+) imaging analyses to investigate the proarrhythmic mechanisms of NPY. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a significantly elevated NPY expression in both the MI and border zone, consistent with findings in human autopsy samples. In cardiomyocytes isolated from ischemic HF mice, NPY treatment increased Ca2+ waves at a dose that did not elicit this response in normal heart cardiomyocytes, an effect suppressed by NPY Y1 receptor blocker. Additionally, the NPY treatment elevated the frequency of delayed afterdepolarizations at the membrane potential level. Similarly, NPY induced VAs that were suppressed by the NPY Y1 receptor blocker in Langendorff-perfused chronic ischemic failed hearts at a concentration that had no effect in normal hearts. We identified structural and functional changes in NPY within an chronic ischemic HF model, leading to increased arrhythmogenicity through Ca2+ mishandling. Therefore, targeting NPY signaling may offer a novel therapeutic approach for treating VAs in patients with chronic ischemic HF.",

    "abstract": "Intramural hematoma (IMH) carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and although thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is increasingly utilized as a treatment, the optimal timing for its intervention remains uncertain. This study aims to compare outcomes between patients undergoing urgent TEVAR (within 24 hours of admission) and those receiving elective TEVAR (beyond 24 hours from admission). Patients who underwent TEVAR between aortic zones 2 and 5 for IMH from 2013 to 2023 were included, excluding those with rupture. Propensity scores were generated using covariates such as age, sex, race, obesity, anemia, transfer status, hypertension, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, dialysis status, medication use, and previous aortic surgery, to adjust for assignment to urgent/emergent or elective TEVAR. Perioperative outcomes were assessed using inverse probability-weighted logistic regression. Association of urgent or elective TEVAR with 5-year mortality was assessed using Cox regression stratified by IMH symptom status. Among 345 patients, 165 (48%) underwent elective repair. The urgent group had a higher rate of transfers from outside institutions (64% vs. 43%, p=0.01), were less likely to use beta-blockers before presentation (69% vs. 84%, p=0.003), and were more frequently symptomatic at presentation (98% vs. 72%, p<0.001). There were no significant differences in IMH disease extent or graft landing zones between groups. Perioperative mortality (6.3% vs. 0.6%; adjusted OR [aOR] 19, 95% CI 3.01-764; p=0.02) and reintervention during index admission (8.3% vs. 2.4%; aOR 4.92, 95% CI 1.67-19.5; p=0.01) was significantly greater in the urgent group. Five-year survival was lower in the urgent group but was not statistically significant. In symptomatic patients, the urgent cohort had significantly higher perioperative mortality (7.3% vs. 0.8%; aOR 10, 95% CI 2.11-152; p=0.02), acute kidney injury (9.0% vs. 2.5%; aOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.12-12.1; p=0.04), and reintervention (8.5% vs. 2.5%; aOR 5.26, 95% CI 1.61-25.6; p=0.01). Conversely, the elective group had a longer total length of stay (32% vs. 21%; aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.82; p=0.01). Five-year survival in the symptomatic cohort was lower in the urgent group but was not statistically significant. Patients undergoing urgent TEVAR for IMH experience worse perioperative outcomes compared to those undergoing elective repairs, despite comparable baseline risk profiles. While emergent repair may be necessary in certain cases, this data advocates for a patient management strategy that prioritizes stabilization before intervention.",

We performed a retrospective review of a database of patients at high risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with previously established outcomes for the presence of OMI in order to compare rates of RWMA in patients presenting with STEMI(+) OMI vs. STEMI(-) OMI. Furthermore, we compared how often the RWMA aligned with the anatomical territory observed on ECG. Among 808 patients, 551 underwent formal echocardiography, including 256 of 265 OMI patients and 295 of 543 patients with No Occlusion. Of the 256 OMIs that underwent formal echocardiography, only 41% (105/256) met STEMI criteria. 90% (94/105) of STEMI(+) OMI patients had RWMA compared to 82% (124/151) of STEMI(-) OMI patients (p = 0.10 [95 CI: -1.63% to 15.6%]). Both groups had greater prevalence of RWMA than the NOMI group (45%). RWMA matched the anatomic territory predicted by ECG in 92.5% of STEMI(+) OMI, 82.3% of STEMI(-) OMI, and 2.9% of the NOMI cohorts. Location of RWMA was well-correlated with ECG findings regardless of the presence or absence of STEMI criteria.

To examine the age-stratified effects of rivaroxaban monotherapy compared with those of rivaroxaban plus antiplatelet agent combination therapy. This was a post hoc secondary analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events With Rivaroxaban in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease (AFIRE) open-label randomized clinical trial. This was a multicenter study conducted in Japan from February 23, 2015, to July 31, 2018. Patients with AF and stable CAD who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting 1 or more years earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD that did not require revascularization were enrolled. Participants were stratified into 4 groups by age (<70 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, and ≥80 years). Study data were analyzed from August 2024 to July 2025. Rivaroxaban monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus antiplatelet agent therapy. The primary efficacy end point was a major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause. The primary safety end point was major bleeding. This study included a total of 2215 participants (mean [SD] age, 74.3 [8.2] years; 1751 male [79.1%]). The incidence of primary efficacy end points per patient-year for rivaroxaban monotherapy vs rivaroxaban plus antiplatelet agent therapy was 3.2% vs 4.3% (<70 years), 3.2% vs 2.8% (70-74 years), 3.8% vs 5.3% (75-79 years), and 6.2% vs 10.3% (≥80 years). The hazard ratios were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.40-1.37) for those younger than 70 years, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.55-2.45) for those aged 70 to 74 years, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.41-1.26) for those aged 75 to 79 years, and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.40-0.93) for those 80 years and older (P for interaction =.51). For the primary safety end points, the incidence was 0.5% vs 2.3% (<70 years), 2.2% vs 2.4% (70-74 years), 1.1% vs 2.1% (75-79 years), and 2.9% vs 4.3% (≥80 years). The hazard ratios were 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06-0.79) for those younger than 70 years, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.39-2.15) for those aged 70 to 74 years, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.19-1.42) for those aged 75 to 79 years, and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.35-1.27) for those 80 years and older (P for interaction =.33). Results of this post hoc analysis of the AFIRE randomized clinical trial reveal that rivaroxaban monotherapy reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and major bleeding across the broad range of age in patients with AF and stable CAD. Possible age-related differences in trends, with more pronounced efficacy in older patients and more pronounced safety in younger patients, should be considered as hypothesis generating and require further research.

    "abstract": "Ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction presents considerable outcome-related challenges, even with the development of surgical revascularization. Coronary artery bypass grafting continues to be a key therapy, yet the best grafting technique, single arterial grafting (SAG) versus multiarterial grafting (MAG) for patients with reduced EF, is uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the comparative outcomes of MAG versus SAG in this high-risk group. Fourteen cohort studies consisting of 19,976 patients were studied, with 10,306 receiving MAG and 9670 receiving SAG. The primary outcomes are 5-year overall survival, cardiac death, and in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes include major adverse cardiovascular events, perioperative myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, atrial fibrillation, postoperative dialysis, stroke, intensive care unit/hospital stay, and sternal wound infection. MAG was notably related to improved 5-year survival [odds ratio (OR), 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70; P < 0.00001] and reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.79; P < 0.00001). While cardiac mortality was not statistically significant, secondary outcomes were generally similar between groups. Sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of findings, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation assessments confirmed moderate to high certainty of evidence. No considerable publication bias was noted. Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials, this review underscores the improved survival of MAG without increased perioperative risk in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. These outcomes indicate that MAG may be suitable in select cases, though further randomized studies are required to confirm these results and guide optimized decision-making.",

This study aimed to assess the predictive performance of high SHR (≥1.18) and low HB/RDW (≤0.76) together in stroke patients treated with thrombolysis. We retrospectively collected data from 345 AIS patients treated with thrombolysis. HB/RDW values were obtained from pre-recombinant tissue plasminogen activator complete blood counts; while fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured in the morning after an 8-14-hour overnight fast. Patients were categorized into four groups based on SHR and HB/RDW levels. We used multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Models assessed associations with in-hospital mortality (IHM), early neurological deterioration (END), and functional outcomes at discharge and 3 months, adjusting for age, sex, prior stroke, pre-existing disability, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy. Propensity score weighting analysis was further conducted as a sensitivity analysis. Among 345 patients, only 37 were in the high SHR (SHR+) and low HB/RDW (HB/RDW+) group. A total of 65 patients (18.8%) died during hospitalization. The SHR+ HB/RDW+ group had significantly higher risks of IHM (adjusted RR: 9.97, 95% CI: 4.95-20.08), END (adjusted RR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.51-5.77), 3-month mortality (adjusted RR: 6.23, 95% CI: 3.49-11.12), and poor 3-month functional outcomes (adjusted RR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.01-4.06) compared to the SHR- HB/RDW- group. These associations remained robust across sensitivity analyses. The combination of SHR ≥1.18 and HB/RDW ≤0.76 predicted IHM with an AuROC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.83). Although the combined biomarker improved sensitivity and net benefit, its AUROC was not statistically superior to that of individual markers. Combined high SHR and low HB/RDW levels at admission significantly predict poor outcomes in thrombolysis-treated AIS, performing better than either biomarker alone. Further validation in larger, diverse cohorts is warranted.",

This study adopted a retrospective design, and a total of 150 patients with HFimpEF who experienced reduced ejection fraction after the first acute myocardial infarction were included. All patients underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Participants were categorized into a control group (n = 70) or an observation group (n = 80) based on their participation in ongoing cardiac rehabilitation. The follow-up period extended for one year. Comparative analyses were conducted to assess differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, cardiac function, anxiety and depression scores, and the incidence of cardiovascular events. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of sex, age, past medical history, blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels, or renal function. Similarly, pre-treatment assessments of cardiac function, six-minute walk test results, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores, or the incidence of cardiovascular events showed no significant differences. Compared to the control group, the observation group demonstrated significantly better cardiac function and six-minute walk test performance, along with significantly lower SAS and SDS scores. Furthermore, the incidence of heart failure and rehospitalization was significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group. Sustained cardiac rehabilitation in patients with HFimpEF was associated with significant improvements in cardiac function, enhanced six-minute walk test performance, reduced anxiety and depression levels, and a lower incidence of heart failure and rehospitalization. These findings highlight the key role of sustained cardiac rehabilitation in improving clinical outcomes for patients with HFimpEF.",

No MCS device showed a significant effect on early mortality vs. initial medical therapy {IABP (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66-1.15), VA-ECMO (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65-1.27), pVAD (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56-1.14), and P (inconsistency) = 0.76}. VA-ECMO and pVAD were associated with increased major bleeding [OR 2.81 (95% CI 1.68-4.71) and OR 5.13 (95% CI 1.87-14.04), respectively]. Higher rates of stroke and sepsis were noted with pVAD. No significant safety concerns were identified with IABP. The mortality benefit of MCS devices in AMI-CS remains uncertain. Using such devices may be associated with increased risks, including major bleeding, stroke, and sepsis. Current evidence does not support the routine use of MCS devices in the management of AMI-CS.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric oxidative pollutants, air temperature, and heatwave events pose potential threats to public health. However, the combined effects of these factors on the risk of mortality from circulatory disease remain insufficiently studied. This study aims to evaluate the synergistic effects of ozone (O₃), oxidant (Ox), and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) with temperature and heat waves, and to explore their impact on circulatory disease mortality, providing evidence to support public health interventions. Based on the mortality, meteorological, and environmental protection data of residents in Fuzhou City from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2022, we employed a generalized additive model (GAM) and a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to assess the effects of atmospheric oxidative pollutants interacting with temperature and heat waves on the risk of death from circulatory diseases, where temperature includes the daily maximum temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR). A bivariate three-dimensional model was used to visualize their synergistic effects, and stratified analyses were conducted to compare differences between heat wave and non-heat wave periods. O3, Ox, and NO2 exhibit synergistic effects with ambient temperature, and their combined exposure significantly increases the mortality risk of circulatory system diseases, myocardial infarction, and stroke, with some health effects showing a \"nonlinear exposure-response relationship with an inverted U-shaped pattern.\" Under heatwave conditions, the synergistic effect between NO2 and high temperatures is markedly enhanced, leading to a greater increase in mortality risk compared to O3 and Ox, and demonstrating both a same-day lag and a cumulative effect. After introducing other pollutants into the dual-pollution model, NO2 still shows a strong independent health effect on major causes of death during heatwaves, with the most pronounced risk elevation observed for stroke. Atmospheric oxidative pollutants interact with high temperatures, diurnal temperature range, and heatwaves, significantly increasing the risk of mortality. It is essential to integrate air pollution and meteorological factors to strengthen health protection during high-risk periods.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in young adults without conventional cardiovascular risk factors is rare and is often associated with non-atherosclerotic causes, including hereditary thrombophilias. Although protein S deficiency is classically associated with venous thrombosis, it has increasingly been implicated in arterial events. The postpartum period is a state of physiological hypercoagulability, which can reveal underlying prothrombotic conditions. Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old woman who developed septoapical AMI one week following elective cesarean section. Coronary angiography revealed thrombosis of the left coronary trunk and anterior descending artery, with no evidence of atherosclerotic lesions. She underwent percutaneous intervention with multiple stents and commenced anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarol following the identification of partial protein S deficiency (56%). During follow-up, she experienced spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding, prompting further investigation. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and reduced activity of factor VIII (20.2%), von Willebrand factor (23.2%), and von Willebrand factor antigen (31.3%), as well as platelet hypofunction on aggregometry, led to a diagnosis of type 1 von Willebrand disease being made. The anticoagulant regimen was switched to dabigatran. The bleeding disorder was likely unmasked by anticoagulation. The final diagnosis was established based on platelet hypofunction and coagulopathy findings, which also guided the therapeutic adjustment. The patient achieved a favorable clinical outcome, characterized by symptom resolution, an absence of new thrombotic or bleeding events, and partial biochemical recovery. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive hematological investigations in young patients presenting with atypical arterial thrombotic events.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) regulate cellular Ca2+ and contribute to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. The IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 complex is the primary MAMs pathway regulating Ca2+ flux and cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. Yiqi Huoxue decoction (YQHX), a Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, shows potential for myocardial infarction (MI) prevention and treatment. However, YQHX's regulation of MAMs and associated Ca2+ mechanisms in MI remains unclear. MI rat and oxygen-glucose deprivation cardiomyocytes model were used to mimic myocardial ischemia in human. in vivo, Rats were randomly divided into Sham, Model, YQHX (8.2 g/kg) and Perindopril (10 mg/kg) groups. 28 days after MI, echocardiography, HE, Masson staining and transmission electron microscopy detections were performed to observe cardiac functions and morphology. The effects of YQHX on H9c2 cell viability, mPTP and Ca2+ levels were examined in vitro. Proteins located at MAMs including Cyclophilin D (CypD), Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU), Sigma-1 Receptor (Sig-1R), and Neurite Outgrowth Inhibitor B (NOGO-B) are abundantly expressed in myocardial tissue. Consequently, these proteins, along with components of the IP3Rs-GRP75-VDAC1 complex, were detected using WB and qPCR. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which regulates mitochondrial function and Ca2+ flux and is widely expressed at MAMs, was assessed using immunofluorescence.MKT-077, an agent known to disrupt the IP3Rs-GRP75-VDAC1 complex, was employed to investigate the mechanism of YQHX on the complex. YQHX improved cardiac function and attenuated pathological changes in vivo. It ameliorated MAMs ultrastructure and function, enhancing CypD, MCU, Sig-1R, and NOGO-B expression while reducing IP3R2, GRP75, and VDAC1. in vitro, YQHX significantly increased viability, reduced oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced mPTP opening and Ca2+ levels, upregulated CypD, MCU, Sig-1R, and NOGO-B, and downregulated IP3R2, GRP75, and VDAC1. YQHX also restored MAMs morphology, decreased mPTP opening and Ca2+ levels, and reversed GRP75 downregulation blocked by MKT-077 under oxygen-glucose deprivation. YQHX exerts cardioprotection against hypoxia by regulating Ca2+ homeostasis and preserving MAMs structure, function, and associated protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Premature senescence is essential for tissue remodeling. Myocardial infarction (MI) induces pathological cardiac remodeling through fibroblast-driven extracellular matrix (ECM) production. The role of senescence in MI-induced remodeling process remains elusive. Here we identify a gradual increment number of senescent cells within the ischemic heart, peaking at day 7 post-MI, in both wild-type and p16 Ink4a -Cre ERT2 -mT/mG senescence reporter mice. Lineage tracing shows that senescent cells transition to non-senescent state within 4 weeks after MI. We perform single-nucleus (sn) Multiome and fluorescence-based spatial transcriptomics analyses to profile senescent cells. We next generate a reference (query dataset) based on SPiDER-βGal/p16-EGFP positivity and map it back to the snMultiome dataset. We then deconvolute senescent cells in the integrated dataset using multiple computational algorisms. Through these approaches, we reveal that fibroblasts and its subpopulation-late myofibroblasts (MF)-constitute a major proportion of senescent cells, which functionally reduce ECM production. Importantly, ischemia-induced senescent MF show less soluble collagen production compared to TGF-β1-induced non-senescent MF in vitro . At the functional level, depletion of senescent cells in vivo augments fibrosis and worsens cardiac myopathy post-MI. Our findings highlight the transient nature of senescent cells in the heart and underscore the importance of dynamic regulation of senescent cells post-MI.",

The relationship between the C₂HEST score, a risk stratification tool for cardiovascular diseases, and NOAF in patients with NSTEMI remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the C₂HEST score and NOAF in patients with NSTEMI. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients who received a diagnosis of NSTEMI from September 2022 to March 2025 were consecutively enrolled. All patients successfully underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 h (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3), and received electrocardiogram monitoring for at least 36 h. The C₂HEST score was calculated based on coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, age, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism. RESULTS A total of 665 patients were enrolled in this study. The average age was 63.31±13.09 years, and male patients accounted for 73.08%. During hospitalization, 63 patients (9.47%) developed NOAF. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that C₂HEST score (OR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.63-2.33) was an independent risk predictor for NOAF. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a linear correlation between the C₂HEST score and NOAF (P for overall <0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the area under the curve of the C₂HEST score was 0.775 (95% CI: 0.724-0.836); the cut-off value was 2.5. CONCLUSIONS Elevated C₂HEST score was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of NOAF in patients with NSTEMI. There was a linear dose-response relationship between C₂HEST score and NOAF.",

This study explored the impact of exercise on CCVD and mortality in women with T2DM according to their menopausal status. A total of 32,477 premenopausal and 53,690 postmenopausal Korean women with T2DM aged 40 to 60 years from a national health examination cohort (2009 to 2018) were included. We evaluated risks for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality based on exercise intensity. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to obtain the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval. Exercise reduced stroke, MI, and mortality risks in women with T2DM, regardless of menopausal status. The highest effects of aHR compared to the sedentary group were 0.68 for stroke, 0.66 for MI, and 0.81 for mortality. Postmenopausal women experienced significant MI risk reductions at most exercise intensities, with the greatest reduction in the ≥1,500 metabolic equivalent of task score group unlike premenopausal women. However, stroke and mortality risk reductions in postmenopausal women were less pronounced compared to premenopausal women. Exercise reduces CCVD risk in women with T2DM across menopausal status. Postmenopausal women with T2DM had more benefits from exercise on MI but fewer benefits on stroke and mortality than premenopausal women. In premenopausal women with T2DM, exercise was not associated with a lower MI risk.",

It underscores the critical need for multimodal imaging to avoid misdiagnosis of rare coronary anomalies. A 57-year-old male presented with severe chest pain lasting several hours, accompanied by hemodynamic instability and ST-segment elevation consistent with myocardial infarction. CAG revealed total occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCX) and suggested that the RCA territory was supplied by a superdominant LCX. Coronary CTA later indicated the absence of the RCA, though diagnostic uncertainties remained. Emergent percutaneous coronary intervention was performed to address the LCX occlusion, resulting in clinical stabilization. Reanalysis of published CAG images revealed no definitive evidence of LCX extending to RCA territory. CTA suggested the \"RCA-supplying branch\" was likely a coronary vein, implying possible misinterpretation of a left-dominant system with anomalous small RCA.

    "abstract": "Ventricular aneurysm (VA) is a severe mechanical complication commonly associated with acute myocardial infarction. Patients who develop VA face a heightened risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism, and heart rupture, resulting in a poor prognosis. The fundamental distinction between VA and ventricular pseudoaneurysm (VPA) lies in whether the heart has ruptured. Medical treatment of symptomatic VA is limited, and surgery repair is frequently the preferred approach. Transcatheter closure techniques serves as a minimally invasive alternative, particularly for patients who are poorly tolerant to surgical procedures. Multi-modality imaging examinations are crucial for the diagnosis and treatment. The optimal treatment plan is formulated after assessment by a specialized cardiac team. Ventricular aneurysm represents a superior prognosis compared with VPA. The management of VA should differ significantly with VPA. At present, there remains a dearth of clinical research on VAs, where substantial clinical randomized controlled trials are lacking. It is therefore imperative that additional clinical studies be conducted in order to provide evidence-based medical guidance for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of VA and VPA in the future. This article aims to provide a thorough review of VA's pathogenesis, diagnostic techniques, treatment options, and prognosis, offering valuable insights for clinical practice and future research.",

The aim of this study is to provide normative myocardial strain and T1 values in mice model along with their changes after myocardial infarction (MI) using a tailored acquisition and analysis protocol. Healthy mice had MRI before and after MI. Imaging was performed to assess cardiac function and left ventricle (LV) strain. A Look-Locker Inversion-Recovery sequence was used for T1 maps reconstruction. Gadolinium doses and timing of image acquisitions were optimized. Radial and circumferential strain measurements were conducted using a custom software based on feature tracking. To address ECG signal interference, adjustments were made for accurate strain calculations. An LV dilation in MI compared to wild-type (WT) with a decrease in LV ejection fraction (p < 0.0001) were reported while stroke volume and cardiac output remained preserved (p > 0.21). Normative strain and T1 mapping data were provided revealing an increase in circumferential strain from base to apex (basal: -14 ± 1%, mid: -15 ± 2%, apical: - 21 ± 3%; p < 0.0001) and notable differences in native and post-contrast T1 values between mid-ventricular and apical LV segments. Circumferential strain differences between MI and WT mice were pronounced, with a significant drop in apical strain (p < 0.0001) in MI. Post-MI mice exhibited higher native T1 and lower post-contrast T1 compared to WT. Our methodological approach not only refines imaging sequences but also offers insights into cardiac function and tissue characteristics in mice. By describing normative values of strain and T1, our findings lay the groundwork for future research, particularly in drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "6PPD (N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine) and its oxidized form, 6PPD-Q (2-((4-methylpentan-2-yl)amino)-5-(phenylamino)cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione), are commonly used in rubber-based materials and have been increasingly found in the environment. Recent studies suggest that these compounds may be toxic to the cardiovascular system, but the exact molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study used a combination of network toxicology, molecular docking, and bioinformatics to investigate how 6PPD and 6PPD-Q affect the heart, particularly in relation to atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. By screening multiple databases and analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) transcriptome data, we identified key targets that are involved in these diseases. We built PPI networks and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to explore the related pathways. Additionally, we validated four core targets-nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1)-that showed high diagnostic value in all three diseases using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Molecular docking revealed that both 6PPD and 6PPD-Q strongly bind to these targets. Further in vitro experiments revealed that 6PPD and 6PPD-Q induce damage in H9c2 cells. The mechanism may be associated with these four targets. This study sheds light on how these environmental pollutants harm the cardiovascular system and demonstrates the value of combining network toxicology with omics and structural biology in risk assessment and therapeutic development.",

Non-cancer participants were matched 1:1 based on sex and year of birth. Exposures: Cardiometabolic factors included type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Main Outcomes: CVD outcomes encompassed stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Generalized linear mixed models with binary outcome were conducted to assess the associations of interest. The mean age at cancer diagnosis was 29.2 years (SD: 5.90), with 57.39% female participants. Cardiometabolic factors were more prevalent in cancer survivors compared to non-cancer participants, with racial/ethnic disparities observed. Significant associations between cardiometabolic factors and CVD were identified; cancer survivors with T2DM had higher odds of MI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.99; 95% CI: 3.45-14.19) and CHF (aOR: 12.304; 95% CI: 7.23-20.91).

Patients enrolled in the Acute Myocardial Infarction in Switzerland (AMIS plus) registry between 2005 and 2024 with information on BB at discharge, LVEF, and one-year mortality were studied. The association between BB therapy and one-year mortality and the interaction with LVEF (>40% versus ≤40%) were analyzed. Among 7820 patients (65% with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction), 1570 (20.1%) had LVEF ≤40%. At discharge, 6211/7820 (79.4%) patients were on BB (LVEF >40%: 78.1%, LVEF ≤40%: 84.5%). One-year mortality was higher in patients with LVEF ≤40% versus >40% (7.1% versus 2.3%; p<0.001). Overall, BB therapy was associated with reduced mortality [unadjusted odds ratio 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.89), p=0.005].

In contrast, in patients with LVEF >40%, mortality did not differ between patients with and without BB (2.1% versus 2.6%; p=0.3). A statistically significant interaction between BB therapy and LVEF stratum was identified (pinteraction=0.02). Data from our large, nationwide registry suggest an overall benefit of BB therapy at discharge on one-year mortality in ACS with most of the survival advantage observed in patients with LVEF <40%.",

However, in clinical trials, adherence is crucial for ensuring the validity and generalizability of study results, and their clinical implications. This pre-specified sub-study of the PACMAN-AMI randomized controlled trial investigated the intake of protocol-mandated high-intensity statin background therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as assessed by direct measurement of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin blood concentrations at 4 and 52 weeks using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. We evaluated the correlation between statin intake and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as well as multi-modality intracoronary imaging endpoints. Among 300 enrolled patients, four (1.3%) reported statin intolerance within 52 weeks. Of 255 patients with completed imaging follow-up and available blood samples, 3 (1.2%) and 5 (2.0%) had no detectable statin concentrations at 4 and 52 weeks, respectively, and were classified as non-adherent. At 52 weeks, adherent patients demonstrated numerically greater reductions in LDL-C (-2.73 vs. +0.07 mmol/L), intravascular ultrasound-assessed per cent atheroma volume (-1.54% vs. -0.15%), and near-infrared spectroscopy-assessed maximum lipid core burden index (-60.6 vs. 0.0), with a higher increase in optical coherence tomography-assessed fibrous cap thickness (+48.53 vs. +7.98 µm). Sensitivity analysis excluding non-adherent patients confirmed the robustness of the main study results. In the PACMAN-AMI trial, intake of high-intensity statin at 4 and 52 weeks post-AMI was excellent, with minimal statin intolerance. These findings, along with the consistent sensitivity analysis, affirm the validity and reliability of the primary study conclusions. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03067844. Statins are essential medications after a heart attack, helping to lower levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, slow the progression of atherosclerosis, and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events. In clinical trials, it is crucial that participants take their prescribed therapies consistently to ensure the reliability and relevance of the study results. This analysis from the PACMAN-AMI trial evaluated how well patients adhered to high-intensity statin therapy during the first year after a heart attack. Statin use was assessed by measuring drug levels in the blood. The findings were reassuring: almost all patients were taking their medication as prescribed, and side effects were very rare. Patients who were adherent showed greater reductions in LDL cholesterol and more favourable changes in coronary artery structure, as assessed by advanced intracoronary imaging techniques. These findings strengthen the validity of the PACMAN-AMI trial’s primary conclusions, published in JAMA. Measuring statin levels in the blood may help identify patients who appear not to respond to treatment, even though they are supposedly taking intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is pivotal in myocardial infarction. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) plays an instrumental role in sustaining intracellular ion concentration and osmotic pressure. This study aimed to explore the function and mechanism of TRPM7 in the myocardial I/R model. AC16 cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypoxia for 4 h and reoxygenated for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h (H/R1 to H/R5). Cellular functions were evaluated using the MTT assay and flow cytometry. Protein expression was assessed by western blotting. Metabolic variations were detected with pyruvate and lactate kits. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays elucidated transcriptional regulation. A myocardial I/R model was constructed, and a TRPM7 inhibitor was administered in the corresponding group; immunohistochemistry, HE staining, and TUNEL assays were conducted for tissue-level detection. The findings revealed a significant decline in cell survival rates, and an increase in apoptosis and TRPM7 expression of AC16 cardiomyocytes under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions, with peak effects in the H/R3 condition. Silencing TRPM7 significantly reversed H/R-induced Ca2+ influx, cell survival rates, and apoptosis. Metabolic analyses indicated an upregulation of glycolysis in AC16 cardiomyocytes under the early stage of H/R, evidenced by elevated glycolysis-related proteins, pyruvate, and lactate levels, and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) inhibited the expression of TRPM7. Subsequent assays showed that H/R-induced glycolysis promoted TRPM7 transcription through histone lactylation, a finding corroborated by the in vivo I/R model. This study highlighted that histone lactylation could be a potential therapeutic target for modulating TRPM7 expression and mitigating I/R injury.",

    "title": "A comprehensive review/expert statement on environmental risk factors of cardiovascular disease.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality globally, with over 20 million deaths each year. While traditional risk factors-such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and poor diet-are well-established, emerging evidence underscores the profound impact of environmental exposures on cardiovascular health. Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), contributes to approximately 8.3 million deaths annually, with over half attributed to CVD. Similarly, noise pollution, heat extremes, toxic chemicals, and light pollution significantly increase the risk of CVD through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and circadian disruption. Recent translational and epidemiological studies show that chronic exposure to transport noise increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. Air pollution, even below regulatory thresholds, promotes atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, and cardiac events. Novel threats such as micro- and nano-plastics are emerging as contributors to vascular injury and systemic inflammation. Climate change exacerbates these risks, with heatwaves and wildfires further compounding the cardiovascular burden, especially among vulnerable populations. The cumulative effects of these exposures-often interacting with behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors-are inadequately addressed in current prevention strategies. The exposome framework offers a comprehensive approach to integrating lifelong environmental exposures into cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention. Mitigation requires systemic interventions including stricter pollution standards, noise regulations, sustainable urban design, and green infrastructure. Addressing environmental determinants of CVD is essential for reducing the global disease burden. This review calls for urgent policy action and for integrating environmental health into clinical practice to safeguard cardiovascular health in the Anthropocene.",

We evaluated the association between recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) and risk of HZO, hospitalized AMI, and hospitalized stroke in adults ≥50 years of age (YoA) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. We conducted a matched cohort analysis of adults ≥50 YoA who received 2 doses of RZV 4 weeks-6 months apart during 01 April 2018-31 December 2020 and were matched 1:4 to RZV-unvaccinated individuals on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and index date (date of second dose among vaccinated; unvaccinated match assigned same date). Follow-up started at index date and ended at receipt of zoster vaccine, termination of membership, death, or 12/31/2022, whichever came first. HZO was identified by natural language processing of clinical notes; hospitalized AMI and stroke were identified by ICD-10 codes.

    "title": "Identification of Hypoxia-related genes in Human Myocardial infarction and Cancers.",
    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) and cancer collectively account for over 50% of global mortality. Recent studies have revealed multiple associations between these two diseases, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, with a particular focus on hypoxia-mediated signaling pathways. In ischemic myocardium, oxygen deprivation triggers apoptosis, fibrosis, and pathological tissue reorganization, in the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia drives angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion. Therefore, identifying hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes in MI may provide potential therapeutic targets for both conditions. Sequencing data from MI patients were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the \"limma\" package in R.Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was then employed to screen for a set of potential hub genes associated with hypoxia. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on these hub genes. The expression levels and stability of the hub genes were subsequently validated in a new dataset. Finally, transcriptional regulatory analysis and immune infiltration analysis were conducted for the hub genes, and their expression levels and prognostic values in various cancers were evaluated. In MI samples, nine genes, namely Immediate Early Response 3 (IER3), Heme Oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), Plasminogen Activator Urokinase Receptor (PLAUR), MAF BZIP Transcription Factor F (MAFF), Solute Carrier Family 2 Member 3 (SLC2A3), Jun Proto-Oncogene (JUN), Transforming Growth Factor Beta Induced (TGFBI), and 6-Phosphofructo-2-Kinase/Fructose-2,6-Biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), were found to be significantly dysregulated and were closely associated with the occurrence of various cancers. Pan-cancer analysis further revealed that these genes are correlated with cancer prognosis. Immune analysis also observed their associations with resting CD4+ memory T cells and Gamma Delta T cells in TME. IER3, HMOX1, CDKN1A, PLAUR, MAFF, SLC2A3, JUN, TGFBI, and PFKFB3 are potential biomarkers for MI and cancer. Research on hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) may provide new therapeutic targets for these two diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid exposure (COE) is linked to adverse health outcomes, but its relationship with cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarise published evidence on CVD risk associated with COE, including prescription opioids, opium use, and opioid use disorder (OUD). Following PRISMA guidelines and PROSPERO registration (CRD42024573206), we searched multiple databases for relevant human studies reporting associations between COE and CVD. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression explored associations by COE type, CVD outcome, and potential moderators. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-E. Seventeen studies (1,676,000 participants) met inclusion criteria, with 13 studies contributing 22 effect sizes to meta-analysis. COE was associated with increased CVD risk (pooled OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12-2.70), though substantial heterogeneity was observed. Cerebrovascular accidents (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.45-2.35) and ischaemic heart disease (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.40-1.63) showed the strongest associations. Opium use had a significant association with CVD, while findings for OUD and prescription opioids were less consistent. Meta-regression identified study design as a key moderator. COE is associated with increased risk of CVD, particularly cerebrovascular accidents and ischaemic heart disease. Given the global opioid and CVD burden, targeted interventions and integrated care approaches are needed. Findings are limited by heterogeneity and risk of bias in published studies. Further high-quality research should explore pathophysiological mechanisms, causality, dose-response relationships, and the potential reversibility of CVD risk following opioid cessation. We searched the scientific literature to identify and describe recent evidence on the association between long-term use of opioids (e.g. opium, heroin, pain medications) and diseases affecting the heart and circulatory system (e.g. heart attack/failure, stroke). We found 17 studies from Iran, the USA, Canada, and Europe with data on a total of 1.7 million people. Most (9) looked at use of opium, 5 studied street drugs (e.g. non-prescribed heroin and fentanyl), and 5 examined prescription drugs (e.g. pain medications). 15 studies were at high or very high risk of bias, generally because they did not consider the effect of other factors linked to the use of opioids and cardiovascular disease (e.g. other drugs/health conditions). The studies generally found more cardiovascular disease among people who used opioids.We combined data from the studies to measure the increase in risk: long-term opioid use can increase the risk of having any cardiovascular disease by 74%. The risk of stroke (blocked/bleeding blood vessels in the brain) was 84% higher, and the risk of reduced blood flow to the heart was 51% higher. People who use opioids should be monitored for cardiovascular disease.",

This study utilized the UK Biobank to evaluate: 1) Best practice for measurement of 'rapid longitudinal shortening', a simplified software-independent measure of longitudinal left ventricular (LV) deformation, 2) correlation and agreement of rapid longitudinal shortening and feature tracking (FT) strain, and 3) their respective prognostic value. Two rapid longitudinal shortening (long-axis shortening, LS; atrioventricular junction shortening; AVJS) and three FT strain measures (global longitudinal strain, GLS; global circumferential strain; global radial strain) were derived. Correlation and agreement were assessed using Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman plots. Incident events were prospectively tracked over 4.4 (3.6, 5.9) years. The association of deformation metrics with incident outcomes (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) was evaluated using Cox regression, adjusting for demographics, lifestyle, clinical factors, LV ejection fraction, and LV mass. The analysis included 45,844 participants (52% females, median 65 years). LS and AVJS showed moderately strong correlation and agreement with GLS. LS, AVJS, and GLS were independently associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes after adjustment. Rapid longitudinal shortening showed comparable predictive value vs. FT strain for incident cardiovascular outcomes: Hazard ratio for incident heart failure was 0.78 (CI 0.69-0.88), 0.79 (CI 0.71-0.89), and 0.78 (CI 0.69-0.89) for AVJS, LS, and GLS respectively. Rapid longitudinal shortening metrics are significant predictors of cardiovascular outcomes comparable to FT strain. Rapid longitudinal shortening is a simple, potentially software- and vendor-independent alternative to FT strain.",

The current guidelines for sleep staging by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) rely on relatively broad categorizations. These traditional sleep stages are not optimized to reflect health status. Here, we propose health-oriented sleep states (HOSS) to better associate with pre-existing health conditions. This observational retrospective cohort study involved 8673 participants from the Massachusetts General Hospital sleep laboratory. We examined seven pre-existing conditions: mild cognitive impairment (MCI), ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. We clustered a sleep staging model's hidden layer within each stage, where clusters represent sleep states. The number of sleep states was selected to maximize the average association with the health conditions, using the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) across outcomes based on time spent in these states. We also assessed the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We identified 3 states within N3, 14 in N2, 6 in N1, 3 in R, and 9 in W. AUROC ranged from 0.608 to 0.723 across the seven outcomes, and AUPRC from 0.064 to 0.524. Among these outcomes, MCI/dementia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and hypertension demonstrated significantly stronger associations with the health conditions compared to conventional AASM sleep stages. Novel sleep states are linked to health conditions. A better understanding of the physiology behind these sleep states may further enhance the concept of using sleep as a window into overall health.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages have a dual role in tissue healing after injury as they perform tissue repair functions but can also precipitate tissue damage or promote fibrosis. Platelets, beyond their role in thrombosis and hemostasis, are crucial mediators of inflammation and interact with macrophages. Platelet-macrophage interactions have been proposed to modulate macrophage phenotype, including their profibrotic functions, but the full extent of the platelet impact on the macrophage transcriptome is unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate how platelets affect macrophage activation in vitro. Using experimental myocardial infarction (MI) in mice as a model of sterile tissue injury, we readily visualized the direct interaction of platelets with macrophages in the ischemic heart using fluorescence microscopy. Bulk RNA-sequencing of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages co-cultured in vitro with thrombin-activated platelets showed a widespread pro-inflammatory activation, with up-regulation of genes associated with inflammation (Il1b, Trem1, Tlr2, Cd14), angiogenesis (Vegfa) and response to hypoxia (Hif1a). Resting platelets also led to activation of inflammatory gene expression by macrophages, albeit to a much lesser extent. Activated or resting platelets, or the platelet-derived chemokine CXCL4, had a limited impact on macrophage expression of pro-fibrotic genes (Spp1, Fn1). Using a transwell assay, we further demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory effects of platelets on the macrophage transcriptome was largely contact dependent. Altogether, our work shows that platelets interact with macrophages in the ischemic heart and polarize macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype in vitro, with potential implications for cardiac macrophage inflammatory activation after acute experimental MI.",

Data were obtained from participants with established hypertension from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study. Participants wore a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Dose-response associations of daily step count and peak 30-min cadence were examined with risk of MACE. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with 1000-step increases in daily step count were calculated. In 36 192 participants [mean (SD) age 64 (7) years, 48% male, follow-up period 7.8 years], non-linear inverse dose-response associations with risk of MACE were observed for daily step count and peak 30-min cadence. Every 1000-step increase in daily step count led to an average lower risk of MACE, HF, MI, and stroke of 17.1% (95% CI: 10.2-23.2), 22.4% (95% CI: 11.0-31.7), 9.3% (95% CI: -2.8 to 19.6), and 24.5% (95% CI: 5.3-39.0), respectively. The magnitude of associations with increasing step count and stepping intensity was comparable between people with and without hypertension for risk of overall MACE, HF, and stroke, but of lower magnitude for MI. Incremental 1000-step increases in daily step count, up to 10 000 steps/day, were associated with substantially lower MACE risk in adults with hypertension, particularly when accrued at a higher stepping intensity. Compared with a daily step count of 2300 steps per day, taking more than 3000 steps per day and walking regularly at a higher cadence was associated with a lower risk of major heart events in people with high blood pressure. Daily step counts well below 10 000 steps per day were associated with a lower risk of major heart events. Every additional 1000 steps taken per day, up to 10 000 steps/day, was associated with a significantly lower risk of death, heart failure, and heart attacks, with reductions ranging from 9.3% to 24.5%.

In this study we identify factors associated with performance variation among rural EMS agencies in first medical contact-to-PCI time. In this explanatory, sequential, mixed-methods study, we ranked eight rural county EMS agencies by continuous first medical contact-to-PCI time, accounting for loaded mileage, using data from a regional STEMI registry (2016-2019). A qualitative researcher conducted 28, one-hour, semi-structured interviews from January- March 2021 with the EMS director, training officer, medical director, and four paramedics at the top two high- and bottom two low-performing rural EMS agencies. Key informants were blinded to agency STEMI performance. Interviews were structured to identify positive deviance by exploring agencies' clinical approach to patients with chest pain, their organizational culture, structure, and quality improvement (QI) activities regarding STEMI care, and recommendations for improving STEMI performance. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. We established a codebook and performed a thematic analysis using an inductive approach. We summarized and compared data across agencies to identify commonalities and differences between high- and low-performing agencies. Findings were reviewed and validated by an expert panel. The top two highest-performing EMS agencies had a median first medical contact-to-PCI time of 79 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 65-91) minutes vs 98 minutes (IQR 82-120) among the bottom two lowest-performing agencies, P<.001. Both high- and low-performing agencies identified issues with electrocardiogram (ECG) transmitting technology and cumbersome hospital activation communications. However, top-performing agencies shared a culture that encourages early EMS activation of the cardiac catheterization lab after STEMI recognition. Top-performing agencies also placed a higher value on QI and training. These agencies prioritized mission and chain of command over staff relationships/interpersonal bonds; have stable, strong leadership; provide opportunities for career advancement; and collaborate with community leaders. Top-performing rural EMS agencies for STEMI care promote early activation, have a strong chain of command, are mission focused, and have a greater focus on quality improvement and training.",

    "title": "Early Emergency Department Visits are a Predictor of Increased Health Care Utilization Within 1 Year After Elective Spine Surgery for Degenerative Pathologies.",
    "abstract": "Retrospective cohort study. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of and risk factors for emergency department (ED) utilization following elective spine surgery and to quantify health care utilization in this subpopulation of patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) imposes financial penalties for unplanned 30-day hospital readmissions following the surgery. Determining predictive factors of hospital readmission and further health care utilization is a concern aligned with the values of both payers and providers to better improve patient outcomes. A total of 618 patients who underwent elective spine surgery between 2013 and 2018 at a single academic institution were identified. Demographic and surgical variables were compared between patients with and without 90-day ED visits. After propensity score matching, univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for 90-day ED visits and compare health care utilization between groups. Of the 618 included patients, 44 (7.1%) had a 90-day ED visit. Patients with ED visits were more likely to have class II obesity (P=0.043), diabetes (P=0.013), congestive heart failure (P=0.006), and a history of myocardial infarction (P=0.027). Independent risk factors were obesity, diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and preoperative opioid use. Patients with a 90-day ED visit had increased health care utilization within 1 year postoperatively, including: more MRI studies (P=0.044), repeat ED visits (P=0.033), more urgent care visits (P=0.007), and opioid prescriptions (P=0.043). While only ∼7% of patients visit the ED within 90 days of spine surgery, various patient-specific factors were predictive of this. As these patients are more likely to be high health care utilizers, attention should be garnered toward preoperative patient optimization.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial revascularization (MR) is recommended in acute myocardial infarction. Understanding the physiological disturbances caused by MR may be pertinent for future therapeutic strategies in the postoperative period. This study aims to analyze the MR impact on plasma metabolites and investigate potential correlations between them with routinely measured biochemical and clinical parameters in MR, and with the cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB). Twenty-five patients had plasma samples collected before and after MR for metabolomic analysis, performed by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. One hundred eleven ions showed statistically significant differences due to MR and thirteen were identified. Only Pregnenolone Sulfate had its abundance in plasma decreased due to MR. Hydrocortisone succinate, Cortisone, and Corticosterone increased in response to the glucocorticoids administered during surgery. LysoPS 16:1, LysoPC 14:0, Phenylvaleric acid, 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, N-Linoleoyl Glutamine, and N-Myristoyl Methionine, along with the significant increase in the white blood cell count are associated with inflammation processes, possibly caused by MR. Furthermore, Pregnenolone sulfate, Pentosidine, Phenylvaleric acid, and N-Myristoyl Methionine were correlated with biochemical/clinical parameters and CPB. These results open new horizons in the interpretation of physiological disturbances caused by MR, as well as provide support for future studies. The scientific community is invited to build upon the outcomes obtained to confirm the associations suggested in this study, advancing the realm of metabolomics and MR.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a critical pathological process following myocardial infarction (MI), contributing to adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. This study investigates the role of N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), an RNA acetyltransferase, in mediating cardiac fibrosis through the N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification of transforming growth factor beta receptor type 1 (TGFBR1) mRNA. Using a mouse model of MI, we demonstrated elevated levels of NAT10 and total ac4C RNA in left ventricular tissues, correlating with increased cardiac fibrosis. Echocardiographic analysis revealed significant impairment in cardiac contractile function, which was further validated by histological assessments using H&E and Masson staining. In vitro studies showed that TGF-β stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts led to enhanced NAT10 expression and myofibroblast differentiation, as evidenced by α-SMA staining. The role of NAT10 was further elucidated through fibroblast-specific knockout experiments, where the absence of NAT10 markedly attenuated cardiac fibrosis and improved echocardiographic parameters at eight weeks post-MI. Additionally, NAT10 knockout resulted in decreased mRNA and protein levels of fibrotic markers such as Collagen I and III, alongside reduced ac4C RNA modification. Additionally, we established that NAT10 enhances the stability of TGFBR1 mRNA via ac4C modification, as supported by RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. TGFBR1 overexpression countered the effects of NAT10 knockout, restoring fibrotic responses in both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that NAT10 plays a pivotal role in cardiac fibrosis following MI by regulating TGFBR1 mRNA stability through ac4C modification, thereby presenting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating cardiac fibrosis in post-MI patients.",

Immediately after the percutaneous coronary intervention, he developed a greater requirement of vasopressors, the addition of inotropes, and an increase in oxygen supply by mechanical respiratory assistance. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed acute ischemic mitral regurgitation due to complete rupture of the posteromedial papillary muscle. Under ventricular assistance with a counterpulsation balloon, a mitral valve replacement was decided, and he left the operating room with extracorporeal membrane for oxygenation (ECMO).

The aim of this nation-wide study was to determine the effect on cardiovascular events after PTX, and to comprehensively evaluate cardiovascular disease manifestations in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, (pHPT). The cohort consisted of 5009 patients who underwent PTX and were identified from the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery. Patients were matched with 14,983 population controls. Data was linked with the National Patient and Death Registries. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated before and after PTX for recurrent events of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and first-onset diagnoses of coronary artery disease, heart failure, aortic and mitral valve stenosis, carotid artery stenosis, peripheral artery disease, and aortic aneurysm (AA). Serum calcium and gland weight were analysed as predictors. TIA was increased in patients pre-and postoperatively with a peak 1-4 years before PTX (IRR: 2.06, CI 95%: 1.31-3.25). The incidence rates for acute myocardial infarction and stroke were not increased pre- and postoperatively. Mitral valve stenosis (IRR: 3.22, 1.51-6.85), and heart failure (IRR: 1.37, 1.11-1.67) were increased preoperatively, but not postoperatively. AA was increased pre- and postoperatively. The incidence rates for mitral valve stenosis and heart failure were increased preoperatively in patients with pHPT, normalizing after surgery. In contrast, the incidence of TIA and AA remained elevated postoperatively.",

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) develops in up to 10% of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. The objective of the current study was to generate a clinical scoring system that can be easily applied in the prehospital setting to predict the development of in-hospital CS among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study using prospective data from a dual hub-and-spoke health system. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between prespecified clinical predictors and the occurrence of in-hospital CS. Internal validation was conducted to assess the C statistic and calibration curve of the prediction model. The prediction model was converted to a risk score by scaling of the regression coefficients. From April 1, 2012, to December 31, 2020, there were 2736 consecutive patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Of these, 415 (15.2%) developed CS. Eight strong predictors were independently associated with CS by multivariable analysis and used to develop a prediction model. The model achieved a C statistic of 0.87. The EARLY SHOCK risk scoring algorithm incorporates Emergency Medical Services Heart Rate and Systolic Blood Pressure, Age, Renal Replacement, Location of Infarction, Sugar (diabetes), Heart Failure, and Cardiac Arrest. The authors identified 8 clinical variables that strongly predict CS among patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This has been developed into the EARLY SHOCK score, which can be easily applied in the prehospital setting to rapidly identify CS and enable shock team activation. External validation for the scoring system is pending for broader application.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus is a herpes virus that affects most individuals globally and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether cytomegalovirus influences outcomes after ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown. Our objective was to investigate the association between latent cytomegalovirus infection and outcomes after STEMI. This study includes 354 patients with STEMI who were recruited to T-TIME (A Trial of Low-Dose Adjunctive Alteplase During Primary PCI) and had blood samples cryopreserved. Participants underwent immediate percutaneous coronary intervention, serial cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at 2 to 7 days and 3 months post-STEMI, and assessment of health-related quality of life with the EuroQol 5-Dimension visual analog scale. Cytomegalovirus Ig (immunoglobulin) G titer was measured in cryopreserved baseline samples from each patient. Results were adjusted for age and other possible confounders. One hundred seventy-five patients (49.4%) were cytomegalovirus IgG titer-negative, 89 (25.1%) were low-positive, and 90 (25.4%) were high-positive. Patients who were cytomegalovirus-positive were older (62.5 versus 58.7 years of age) and more likely to be non-White (6.7% versus 2.3%). Myocardial reperfusion, measured by ST-segment resolution, was less successful in patients who were cytomegalovirus-positive (38.7% resolution versus 48.4%; adjusted P=0.032). Left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in patients who were cytomegalovirus-positive in the first week (42.6% versus 45.3%; adjusted P=0.006) and at 3 months (47.8% versus 49.7%; adjusted P=0.033). Over 3 months, patients who were cytomegalovirus-positive had less improvement in health-related quality of life (change in EuroQol 5-Dimension visual analog scale: +3.38 versus +9.93; adjusted P<0.001). Patients who are cytomegalovirus-positive with STEMI have impaired reperfusion, reduced left ventricular function, and less improvement in health-related quality of life over 3 months.",

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the SAVE score in NSTE-ACS patients to noninvasively identify patients with high-risk angiographic risk who might benefit from an early invasive strategy. We prospectively assessed 950 consecutive patients admitted to five different hospitals with a diagnosis of NSTE-ACS, 598 (491 male, mean age 63 ± 12 years) of whom were risk-stratified according to the SAVE risk score. The primary endpoint was the identification of high-risk angiographic features. High-risk angiographic features were observed in 347 (58%) (292 male/55 female). SAVE score was significantly higher in patients in the high-risk angiography group compared with patients without high-risk features [6 (4.5-8) ± vs. 4 (2-5.5); P < 0.001]. Using the proposed risk score, 79% (275 out of 347 patients) were correctly identified as having a high angiographic risk, and 58% (145 out of 251 patients with low-risk angiographic features) were also correctly identified by the SAVE score. The SAVE score adequately identified patients with high angiographic risk who may benefit from early invasive management strategies.",

    "abstract": "This umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence from previously conducted meta-analyses and review articles to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on lipid profile and cardiovascular events. While adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews guidelines, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from the database inception to June 2024 to identify relevant articles. The outcomes were total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL cholesterol, triglyceride (TAG), apolipoprotein B (APOB), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), major cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction (MI). A corrected covered area (CCA) assessment was performed to determine overlap among reviews. Each included review was assessed for its quality and rigor via the AMSTAR-2 tool. From 18,297 articles identified during the literature search, 18 meta-analyses were included. A significant overlap was noted across studies with a corrected cover area of 44.4%. Bempedoic acid's effects on cardiovascular outcomes and lipid levels have been extensively studied. For cardiovascular mortality, the evidence is mixed: Goyal et al.21 reported a risk ratio (RR) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.61-1.08) suggesting a potential benefit, while other studies, such as De Filippo et al.26 and Zhang et al.24, indicate no significant association. In terms of MACE, 11 reviews show a consistent trend toward reduced risk, with RRs between 0.75 and 0.88. Bempedoic acid also appears to significantly reduce the risk of MI, with RRs and odds ratios (ORs) around 0.76. Evidence on unstable angina suggests a lower risk, although some studies do not reach statistical significance. For coronary revascularization, the data show a reduced risk, with RRs ranging from 0.74 to 0.82. Studies on coronary non-revascularization also indicate a significant risk reduction with RRs and ORs of 0.41. Regarding lipid levels, bempedoic acid consistently reduces LDL cholesterol (mean differences [MDs] from -17.5% to -33.91%), total cholesterol (MDs from -12.69% to -34.41%), and non-HDL cholesterol (MDs from -12.3% to -23.27%). The effects on HDL cholesterol are less consistent (MDs from -1.29% to -5.18%), and triglyceride levels show variable results (MDs from -8.35% to +5.23%). Our findings show that bempedoic acid significantly reduces the risk of MACE, nonfatal MI, coronary and noncoronary revascularization, and hospitalizations for unstable angina. While results on cardiovascular mortality are mixed, suggesting a need for further study, bempedoic acid proves to be an effective treatment for improving lipid profiles and reducing cardiovascular events, especially in patients who cannot tolerate statins. It presents a valuable option for cardiovascular risk management, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. Further research is needed to assess its long-term benefits and broader applicability.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia have substantially elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, a disparity further exacerbated by coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The impact of specific antipsychotics on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM remains unclear. We aimed to compare major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with co-occurring T2DM and schizophrenia treated with aripiprazole versus risperidone. We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study within the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (2014-2024). Adults (≥18 years) with diagnoses of T2DM and schizophrenia who were new users of aripiprazole or risperidone were identified. Aripiprazole and risperidone cohorts were propensity score-matched 1:1 (n = 5,691 each) on demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index), healthcare utilization, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and baseline medications. The primary outcome was time to first major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, or all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes over up to 10 years of follow-up. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, and race and a time-stratified analysis (≤1 year vs. >1 year follow-up) were performed. After matching, baseline characteristics were well balanced (mean age 51.1 years, 45% female, median HbA1c ∼7.3% in both groups). Aripiprazole was associated with a significantly elevated hazard of MACE compared to risperidone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.18). This risk difference emerged primarily beyond the first year of treatment. The excess risk with aripiprazole was driven largely by higher rates of heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, whereas risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were similar between groups. No significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect was observed across sex, age, or racial subgroups. In this large real-world cohort of patients with T2DM and schizophrenia, aripiprazole use was associated with a modest but significant increase in the risk of MACEs compared to risperidone. Clinicians should remain vigilant about cardiovascular risk management in this population regardless of antipsychotic choice. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and to confirm these observations in prospective studies.",

However, the recommendation is not currently supported by research specifically designed to compare continuation versus discontinuation of SGLT2is for patients who have received the treatment for a while before experiencing renal function deterioration. Using linked Taiwanese databases with claims and clinical data and a target trial emulation framework, we conducted a nationwide cohort study to investigate the association between SGLT2i continuation and major cardiorenal outcomes after renal function declined. We identified patients with type 2 diabetes who received SGLT2is during 2016-2020, who either continued or discontinued SGLT2is within 180 days after their eGFR declined below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The study outcomes were myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, acute kidney injury, and all-cause mortality. We estimated the on-treatment and intention-to-treat hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing SGLT2i continuation versus SGLT2i discontinuation, adjusting for baseline and time-varying covariates using inverse probability weighting. Among 11,467 eligible patients, the on-treatment HR associated with SGLT2i continuation was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.59-1.18) for myocardial infarction, 0.74 (0.56-0.95) for stroke, 0.58 (0.49-0.69) for heart failure, 0.53 (0.45-0.63) for acute kidney injury, and 0.51 (0.42-0.61) for all-cause mortality. The results did not change meaningfully in the intention-to-treat analysis or within pre-specified patient subgroups, including patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or prior acute kidney injury. Our findings provide scientific evidence to support continuing SGLT2i use when renal function declines during the SGLT2i treatment course.",

Between 29th May, 2000 and 21st April, 2022, a total of 526 patients (median age 67.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 58.1 - 74.0 years], 271 males; median follow-up 267 days [IQR 86 - 856 days]) undergoing surgery for spine or extremity bone metastases were retrospectively included. Nine prognostic models were evaluated in the entire cohort (n = 526), and separately in subgroups treated for spine (n = 224) or extremity (n = 302) metastases. Cox-regression and logistic regression models were used, as appropriate. Harrell's c-statistic, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) and Brier score were used as performance metrics. When assessed in the entire cohort, models by Sorensen et al. (AUC 12 months 0.834), Janssen et al. (c-index 0.711) and Katagiri et al. (c-index 0.699) achieved highest discriminatory performance.

Performance of all models was slightly lower when assessed in the extremity subgroup. Haemoglobin levels and tumour profile (i.e. primary histology) ranked among the most important predictors, consistent across subgroups. Our study suggests particularly helpful predictive performance of the models by Sorensen et al. and Janssen et al. in both patients with extremity metastases and patients with spine metastases undergoing surgery.

In a multicenter prospective cohort study, we measured plasma levels of 22 inflammatory cytokines in 486 acute stroke patients (474 ischemic strokes and 12 intracerebral hemorrhages; median age 68 years, 34% female, median 3 days post-stroke onset). Patients were followed for over 5 years through telephone and in-person interviews to record the occurrence of the following outcomes: (1) recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA; primary outcome); (2) a composite of recurrent vascular events (stroke, TIA, acute coronary syndrome, hospital admission due to heart failure, and death; secondary outcome). Associations between cytokine levels and these outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and vascular risk factors. During the 5-year follow-up period, 59 patients (12.1%) experienced recurrent stroke or TIA, and 118 (24.3%) experienced recurrent vascular events. After adjustments for demographic and vascular risk factors, and correction for multiple comparisons, higher plasma levels of CD62E (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR)/SD increment: 1.63, 95%CI 1.22-2.20) and MIF (aHR: 1.56, 95%CI 1.18-2.06) in the acute phase after stroke were statistically significantly associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke or TIA. The associations followed a dose-response pattern across quartiles of CD62E and MIF levels. Adding baseline CD62E and MIF levels to models including age, sex, vascular risk factors, and baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) levels led to significant improvements in the prediction of 5-year risk of recurrent stroke or TIA (ΔC-index 0.030-0.050). Among stroke patients, higher baseline levels of CD62E and MIF improved prediction of 5-year risk of recurrent stroke or TIA on top of vascular risk factors and CRP levels. Whether assessment of these cytokines could improve patient selection for secondary prevention trials of anti-inflammatory treatments, should be explored in future studies.",

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were recruited; depressive symptoms were evaluated, inflammatory factors were detected, and the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for CAD patients with depression were recorded. Furthermore, fluoxetine and SN50 were administrated separately for treatment in MI mice, SERT knockout mice, and H9C2 cell experiments. CAD patients with depression had higher value of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-17, IFN-α, and IFN-γ (P < 0.05) compared to those without depression. CAD + depression patients were followed up for 2 years, those who received SSRIs treatment experienced lower cardiac events [1 events (3.7 %) vs. 14 events (11.8 %)] than those who did not. The animal experiment showed that MI surgery induced cardiac dysfunction and autonomic nerves injury which were exacerbated by excessive inflammatory response. Moreover, MI mice exhibited depressive behaviors, possibly due to autonomic nerves injury and inflammation in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, fluoxetine and SN50 contributed to improving cardiac function, regulating cardiac vegetative nervous, relieving depressive behaviors, and reducing inflammation via macrophages/TNF-α/TNFR/NF-κB signaling pathway. SERT knockout mice experiment further revealed the association between 5-HT and inflammation. In addition, the H9C2 cell experiment presented demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of fluoxetine. This study identified inflammation, autonomic nerves dysfunction/5-HT as critical mechanisms of MI + depression. Antidepressant treatment would benefit both heart and brain. Moreover, anti-inflammation would be a promising approach for treating MI complicated with depression.",

    "abstract": "Physical fitness, particularly cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle strength, is associated with reduced disease risk. However, its combined association with biological aging in promoting healthy longevity remains unanswered. We investigated whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle strength could modify the prospective associations between accelerated biological aging and premature termination of healthy longevity. Prospective observational study. This study included 46,481 UK Biobank participants. CRF was estimated via individualized submaximal bike protocols and muscle strength was measured using hand dynamometers. Biological aging was quantified using PhenoAge based on 9 blood biomarkers and chronological age. Age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) was derived from regressing PhenoAge on chronological age. Termination of healthy longevity was defined as the first occurrence of 8 health-deteriorating events (cancer, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, dementia, congestive heart failure, and death). High CRF and muscle strength were each associated with a 10% [hazard ratio (HR), 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-0.94] and 13% (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91) reduction in the health span termination risk compared with their bottom tertile counterparts, after adjusting for confounders. Additive interaction was found between PhenoAgeAccel and both CRF (P = .042) and muscle strength (P = .005), with multiplicative interaction found only with muscle strength (P = .026), suggesting that the largest risk elevation occurred in those with low CRF/muscle strength. Joint analysis showed (1) heightened risk of health span termination associated with accelerated biological aging was partially attenuated by high CRF and muscle strength, and (2) accelerated biological aging exhibited the highest risk in individuals with low fitness. Enhanced CRF and muscle strength could offset the risk of premature health span termination associated with accelerated biological aging. Our findings suggest that biological aging rates should be considered in personalized fitness interventions to optimize health span. Public health strategies should prioritize cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness to mitigate aging-related health risks.",

    "abstract": "Background In patients at elevated risk for redo mitral valve surgery, transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) can be taken into consideration as a less invasive alternative. However, long-term outcome data on mitral valve-in-ring (ViR) and valve-in-valve (ViV) procedures is scarce. We herein report the 3-year outcomes following these interventions. Methods Between 2014 and 2023, 51 consecutive patients received ViR/ViV TMVR at our center. Baseline, periprocedural and 3-year outcome parameters were analyzed according to M-VARC criteria. Results Among 51 patients (70.9±13.6 years, STS-Score 3.3±2.3 %, LVEF 50±12%), 19 underwent ViR and 32 ViV TMVR. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 71 months. The 30-day mortality rate was 5.9% (3/51 patients). Over time, access shifted from transapical to transseptal (p for trend <0.01). Rehospitalization, neurological events and myocardial infarction occurred in 2.0% (1/51 patients), 2.0% (1/51 patients) and 0.0% of the cases, respectively. No structural valve failure was observed. Functional failure was 3.9% of cases due to significant residual mitral regurgitation. Most paravalvular leak occluder implantations were performed in ViR patients (6/9, 66.7%) (4 rigid rings and 2 semi-rigid rings). Three-year survival was 87.5% for ViR and 83.4% for ViV, with no differences between groups. Conclusions Mitral ViR and ViV procedures demonstrate acceptable safety and clinical efficacy up to 3 years. Rigid annuloplasty rings are associated with an increased risk of significant residual regurgitation. Over the last decade, a clear transition from the transapical to the transseptal access has been observed, further reducing procedural trauma in this high-risk subset of patients.",

Compared to traditional open-chest approaches, EGI offers improved clinical translatability, reduced invasiveness, and minimized physiological impact on the animal. While EGI is well established in murine models, its application in rats remains limited due to anatomical and technical challenges. In particular, thinning of the left ventricular anterior wall (LVAW) in infarcted and peri-infarct regions complicates safe and accurate myocardial delivery, as wall thickness can fall below the needle bevel size of commonly used 27 G or 28 G needles, increasing the risk of ventricular perforation or failed delivery. To address this limitation, we optimized a protocol for EGI in rat MI models using 29 G Spinocan needles. The smaller-diameter, longer needle enables precise targeting of thin myocardial tissue, minimizing damage and enhancing injection accuracy, independent of LVAW thickness. This technique is compatible with standard transthoracic echocardiography platforms and eliminates the need for thoracotomy, allowing longitudinal studies in the same animal. Our refined method enables robust, reproducible delivery of therapeutic agents into viable myocardium adjacent to the infarct zone, where regenerative therapies are most effective. By improving safety and targeting precision, this approach increases the translational relevance of preclinical cardiac research and supports the development of standardized protocols across laboratories.",

However, among the commonly used modeling methods, the traditional polyethylene-tube-assisted coronary artery ligation method has significant drawbacks. It requires reopening the chest to untie the ligature, which is not only time-consuming but also causes substantial damage to the experimental animals and can easily lead to their death. The aim of this study is to introduce an improved model-preparation method. In this method, the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery (LAD) is ligated using a double live-knot coil, and the live-knot can be opened in vitro to achieve reperfusion, thus avoiding a second invasive procedure. Evaluation methods such as electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, M-mode echocardiography (ME) determination, Evans Blue and 2,3,5-triphenyte-trazoliumchloride staining (EB-TTC) showed that this method could induce stable MI/RI. This improved MI/RI model scheme is characterized by its simplicity and speed, and the modeling success rate is highly satisfactory.

The genetic variations in CYP2C19 can affect the efficacy and bioavailability of the drug that can be checked via genotype testing of the gene. This study evaluates the impact of genotype versus conventional guided P2Y12 inhibitor therapy on post-PCI patient outcomes. Guided by PRISMA and AMSTAR-2, we analyzed 10 trials comparing genotype-guided and conventional P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in post-PCI patients. Our search, spanning up to October 2022 across major databases, focused on adult populations undergoing PCI, assessing outcomes like mortality, MACE, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, and bleeding events. A total of 10 studies involving 4300 patients were selected in pooled analysis, genotype-guided therapy markedly reduced all-cause mortality (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.95) and MACE (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.88), without a significant increase in bleeding events (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.61-1.14). Furthermore, significant reductions were observed in myocardial infarction (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44-0.78) and stent thrombosis (RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.3-0.996), with stroke also seeing a decrease (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35-0.9). Genotype-guided P2Y12 inhibitor therapy significantly improves outcomes for post-PCI patients, reducing mortality, MACE, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis without increasing bleeding risk.

Neutrophils contribute to cancer progression and cardiovascular complications through various mechanisms, including their ability to promote inflammation, thrombosis, and vascular damage by interacting with vascular endothelial cells, platelets, and other immune cells, or by forming NETs. In cancer, neutrophils contribute to a hypercoagulability state, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis, and can also lead to thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Cancer affects neutrophil numbers and functional properties, induces the appearance of several neutrophil subtypes, and can alter hematopoiesis.

    "abstract": "Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) remain the most commonly used conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting, but their high failure rates necessitate repeated revascularization in many cases. SVG perforation, although rare, is a severe complication that can result in cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, or death if not promptly managed. Three main stages describe SVG failure pathophysiology, starting with thrombosis, followed by intimal hyperplasia, and progressing to atherosclerosis later in the process. The development of SVG perforation results from patient-related characteristics, including advanced age, male gender, and hypertension, as well as graft-related elements such as degenerate or older grafts and procedural aspects, including stent oversizing in chronic total occlusion interventions. Perforations categorized by the Ellis scale exist in 3 types, but type III represents the most serious condition, which leads to high mortality rates. The priorities for immediate SVG perforation treatment include balloon inflation, anticoagulation reversal, and placing stents into the affected area. Larger perforations need treatment with either covered stents or coil embolization methods. Surgical intervention is the only option available for perforations that cannot be treated through catheter interventions or when all other endovascular approaches have failed. After an SVG perforation occurs, the medical prognosis becomes unfavorable because patients have considerably elevated mortality rates during hospitalization and beyond it. The prognosis of SVG perforation appears to improve through prevention methods combining undersized vein grafts and new-generation procedures like intravascular lithotripsy. This review underlines the need to discover SVG perforations early for effective treatment and preventive strategies that enhance patient survival.",

There is limited research about the association between psychoactive substance use and cardiovascular death due to AMI. This study aims to analyze trends in AMI-related mortality among older adults (aged ≥ 65) associated with psychoactive substance use in the USA from 1999 to 2020, with a focus on demographic and geographic variations. We conducted a descriptive analysis using death certificates from the CDC's WONDER database. Data were extracted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, urban-rural status, and geographic region. Crude mortality rates and AAMR were calculated, and temporal trends were assessed using Joinpoint regression. Between 1999 and 2020, there were 231 359 AMI-related deaths among older adults with substance use disorders. Men (39.2) had a markedly higher mortality rate than women (15.0). Mortality rates increased across all age groups, with the most pronounced rise in those aged 85 and older (33.9). Metropolitan areas (22.3) experienced lower mortality rates than nonmetropolitan areas (37.9). The Midwest (32.3) consistently recorded the highest mortality rates, followed by the Northeast (25.0), South (24.5), and West (18.7). The study reveals notable temporal trends in AMI mortality among older adults with psychoactive substance use, highlighting significant demographic and regional disparities.

    "abstract": "Myocardial Infarction (MI) typically leads to unfavorable heart failure due to delayed reperfusion treatment. The adult heart is generally considered a nonregenerative organ. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart possesses the unique and transient ability to regenerate after injury. The underlying mechanisms governing heart regeneration remain largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that the nuclear auto-antigenic sperm protein (NASP) plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This study explored the role of NASP in the heart for the first time, emphasizing its effect on cardiac regeneration and repair after injury. NASP exhibited high expression in neonatal myocardium and was observed to increase following apical resection (AR). The influence of NASP on cardiomyocyte proliferation was evaluated by examining cell cycle activity, mitosis, and cytokinesis staining using cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression or knockdown adenovirus 5 vectors. NASP knockdown inhibited heart regeneration in neonatal mice post-AR; whereas, NASP overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted myocardial repair in adult mice post-MI. Mechanistically, NASP promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation through transcriptionally upregulating platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), subsequently activating the downstream AKT/c-MYC pathway. Our study highlights the key role of NASP in facilitating cardiac regenerative repair after injury, indicating its potential as a novel therapeutic target for MI.",

It is imperative to comprehend the clinical parameters that influence patient outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings such as Syria. This study specifically focuses on thrombotic laboratory parameters and their role in predicting the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. This prospective, multicenter study was conducted in Al-Razi Hospital and the University Cardiac Surgery Hospital in Aleppo, Syria. It included 60 adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, admitted between November 2021 and March 2022. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory parameters, including D-dimer, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, and complete blood count, were collected and analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 27. Among the 60 patients (42 males, 18 females), the mean age was 63.87 years. Key findings revealed a high mortality rate of 50% among hospitalized patients. Elevated D-dimer levels at admission were significantly associated with increased mortality (P < 0.001), with a threshold value of 1550 ng/ml predicting death with 80% sensitivity and 85% accuracy. Additionally, age over 61.5 years and preexisting cardiovascular diseases also significantly influenced survival outcomes.

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a primary global health concern, affecting an estimated 38 million individuals as of 2023. While HIV is best known for its immunosuppressive effects, its cardiovascular implications are equally significant. HIV infection contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) through chronic immune activation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and coagulopathy. These mechanisms increase the risk of myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and thrombotic events in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, the advent of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has transformed HIV from a fatal illness into a chronic, manageable condition. Despite this progress, HAART - particularly regimens involving protease inhibitors and certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors - has introduced new cardiovascular challenges. These include dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, mitochondrial toxicity, and altered adipose tissue distribution, all of which further elevate cardiovascular risk. Additionally, HAART modifies immune and metabolic pathways, potentially exacerbating underlying HIV-associated cardiovascular mechanisms. Emerging research into microbial translocation and gut dysbiosis also points to complex interactions between HIV, HAART, and cardiovascular outcomes. As survival improves for PLWH, cardiologists and infectious disease specialists must collaborate to address both the direct effects of HIV and the unintended cardiovascular consequences of its treatment. The authors' review explores the dual impact of HIV and HAART on the cardiovascular system, emphasizing the importance of integrated care, early risk assessment, and therapeutic strategies tailored to the unique cardiovascular profile of PLWH.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of death, with inflammation and glycolipid dysregulation as key drivers of atherosclerosis progression. While triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) are linked to cardiovascular risk, their prognostic value in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients, particularly Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients, and mediating role of systemic inflammation remain unclear. This study investigates the relationship between glycolipid metabolism, systemic inflammation, and mortality in ACS patients. In this single-center retrospective study, 3,861 ACS patients were analyzed. Glycolipid metabolism was assessed using the TyG and AIP index, while the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) evaluated inflammatory status. Missing data were addressed with random forest multiple imputation. Statistical analyses included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression for variable selection, generalized linear modeling, restricted cubic splines (RCS) for nonlinear associations, and the Mantel test for correlations between glycolipid metabolism and inflammatory markers. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression, RCS models, and mediation analysis were used to assess associations and pathways. Elevated TyG index linearly increased mortality risk in ACS patients (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.07-2.52) and AMI subgroups (OR = 1.56, 95% CI:1.00-2.42), with minimal SII mediation (ACS:3.97%; AMI: non-significant).The AIP index directly increased mortality risk (ACS: Beta coefficient (β) = 0.076; AMI: β = 0.091, p < 0.001), partially offset by SII's negative mediation (ACS:-6.6%; AMI:-7.8%). SII showed U-shaped mortality associations in ACS and AMI patients, with the lowest risk around 450-900  ×  10⁹/L. Age ≥ 75 (ACS: OR = 8.35; AMI: OR = 10.12), STEMI diagnosis (ACS: OR = 1.46; AMI: OR = 1.53), and elevated total cholesterol (ACS: OR = 1.50; AMI: OR = 1.40) were independent mortality predictors. Increased HDL-C (ACS: OR = 0.198; AMI: OR = 0.280) was an independent protective factor. The TyG and AIP index independently predict mortality in ACS and AMI patients through direct metabolic toxicity rather than inflammatory mediation.SII exhibits a U-shaped mortality association, reflecting bidirectional immune regulation (tissue repair vs. damage), with an optimal threshold range of 450-900 × 109/L to guide anti-inflammatory strategies. Findings support metabolic-inflammatory risk stratification, prioritizing glycolipid metabolic dysregulation intervention in acute events while dynamically monitoring SII to balance immune homeostasis.

The objective of this report is to describe the development of proteinuria in a patient after high-dose rosuvastatin therapy and discuss the subsequent resolution with a medication switch. A 70-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, primary hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia, developed proteinuria after receiving high-dose rosuvastatin following an episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Prior to therapy, her low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 123 mg/dL, coronary calcium score was 270, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios were 7.6 mg/g and 6.7 mg/g (normal albumin-to-creatinine ratio <30 mg/g). After 3 months of rosuvastatin therapy, proteinuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 344.1) and muscle cramps developed, though her renal function remained stable (glomerular filtration rate >70 mL/min/1.73 m2). After discontinuing rosuvastatin and switching to atorvastatin (20 mg/d) and ezetimibe (10 mg/d), proteinuria resolved, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was maintained at 45 mg/dL. Statin-induced proteinuria is a dose-dependent and typically reversible condition, more likely to occur with higher statin doses, such as rosuvastatin. Although proteinuria is generally transient, careful monitoring and dose adjustments are critical to optimizing statin therapy and patient adherence. This case highlights the importance of individualized statin therapy, emphasizing monitoring for dose-dependent side effects such as proteinuria.",

These web-like structures, composed of DNA, histones, and granule proteins released by neutrophils, contribute significantly to both inflammation and thrombosis. This manuscript offers a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the involvement of NET in atherosclerosis, highlighting their interactions with various pathophysiological processes and their potential as biomarkers for CVD. Notably, the impact of radiation on NET formation is explored, emphasising how oxidative stress and inflammatory responses drive NET release, contributing to plaque instability. The role of histones, particularly citrullinated histones, in endothelial dysfunction and plaque progression is discussed, highlighting their significance in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the complex relationship between lipoproteins and NET formation is examined, with a focus on how elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels facilitate NET release, thus promoting vascular inflammation and plaque instability. The influence of cholesterol on NET formation is also explored, underscoring its contribution to plaque development and stability. The role of Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) in the regulation of NETosis is reviewed, with attention given to how PAD4-driven citrullination of histones affects atherosclerosis progression. Moreover, the manuscript examines the potential of NET components-such as double-stranded DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3-as biomarkers for assessing disease severity and predicting adverse cardiovascular events, including ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and stroke. Elevated levels of these biomarkers correlate with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting their utility in guiding therapeutic interventions. In contrast to the existing body of work, this review highlights the novelty of integrating recent findings on NET interactions with lipid metabolism, histone modifications, and PAD4 activity in the context of atherosclerosis. Overall, NET plays an integral role in the inflammatory and thrombotic processes underpinning atherosclerosis, and their components hold promise as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease management.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association of sleep disorder with the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among patients with schizophrenia-a population known to have heightened cardiometabolic vulnerability, yet underexplored in terms of sleep-related cardiovascular risk. The cross-sectional study included 1,072 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia between January and December 2022. The sleep disorder was defined based on self-reported sleep duration, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness, and collected via self-completed questionnaire. Patients' MACEs including fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death were collected from chart review. Multivariate logistic regression model was employed to assess the association of sleep disorders with the risk of MACE after controlling for potential confounding factors. Sleep disorders were common, with 25.7% reporting insomnia, 30.0% reporting short sleep duration (<6 h), and 36.0% experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness. Among the 1,072 patients with schizophrenia, 20.3% experienced a MACE. Participants who have insomnia, short duration of sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness were more likely to have MACEs compared with those without these sleep disorders (all p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that insomnia (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.26-2.78; p < 0.01), short sleep duration (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.17-2. 35; p < 0.01), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.13-2.12; p < 0.01) were significantly associated with the risk of MACE after controlling for potential confounding factors. Sleep disorders are significantly associated with a higher risk of MACEs in patients with schizophrenia.",

Although in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cases, the association between HbA1c and coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 167 non-diabetic STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The SYNTAX score was utilized to evaluate CAD severity. Cases were categorized into three groups based on the HbA1c levels: <5%, 5.1-5.9%, and 6-6.5%. SYNTAX scores significantly increased in the cases with 6 to 6.5 HbA1c levels compared to the other group (28.9±9.5 vs 21.2±5.2 vs 13.7±4.5, P=0.000). Additionally, death was more elevated in this group (4% vs 0% vs 0%, P=0.006). Higher HbA1c levels are strongly associated with coronary atherosclerosis in non-diabetic patients that present with non-diabetic STEMI. Consequently, in non-diabetic STEMI patients, HbA1c may be able to predict the severity of CAD.",

    "abstract": "Background Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are uncommon congenital variations with potentially significant clinical implications, including myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death. Data on their prevalence and patterns in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), particularly in Dubai, remain limited. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, anatomical types, and clinical presentation of CAAs among patients undergoing coronary angiography at a tertiary care center in Dubai. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on all coronary angiograms performed at Rashid Hospital between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023. Two independent cardiologists reviewed the angiograms to identify CAAs. Clinical data, including presentation and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were extracted from electronic medical records. Results Among 6,228 coronary angiograms, 92 patients (1.48%) were found to have CAAs. Myocardial bridging was the most frequent anomaly (52.2%), followed by anomalies of coronary origin (45.7%) and coronary artery fistula (2.2%). The majority of patients were men (85.9%), with a mean age of 54.0 ± 11.5 years. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was the most common presentation (63.0%). Most patients had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (67%) and were discharged alive (97.8%). AMI occurred more frequently in origin-related CAAs (73.8%), while anginal symptoms were more common in course-related CAAs (37.5% versus 14.3%, P = 0.086). Conclusion CAAs were infrequent but clinically relevant findings in patients undergoing coronary angiography in Dubai. Myocardial bridging was the predominant anomaly. These results underscore the importance of systematic evaluation for CAAs during angiographic assessment. Further multicenter research utilizing advanced imaging and long-term follow-up is needed to refine risk stratification and management strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to provide an updated assessment of the changes in respiratory function after β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (β-blockers) administration in asthma patients. The main assumption of the study was to use new methodological and statistical approaches not previously applied in this field in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. To select studies, PubMed/Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library were searched. Additionally, Google Scholar was searched for gray literature. A systematic review and meta-analysis for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate in asthma patients after administration of cardio-selective and non-selective β-blockers compared to placebo or baseline was performed. We also assessed FEV1 after topical β-blocker application compared to baseline. An independent subgroup analysis demonstrated significantly higher FEV1 in the placebo group (standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, -0.34, P = 0.0003) than in non-selective β-blockers. The test for subgroup differences indicates that there is a statistically significant subgroup effect among cardio-selective and non-selective β-blockers (P = 0.03, I 2 = 80%). We also showed a statistically significant decrease in FEV1 (SMD = -0.70, 95% CI: [-1.56 to -0.03], P = 0.04) after topical β-blocker application. Patients with asthma may tolerate cardio-selective β-blockers better than non-selective β-blockers. The FEV1 value depends on the type of β-blocker used. Cardio-selective β-blockers may be cautiously considered in patients with asthma only when strong cardiovascular indications exist (such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or post-myocardial infarction) and with appropriate monitoring. At the same time, less risky therapeutic options should be chosen instead of topical β-blockers. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier 42024606876.",

This study aims to assess how evidence-based nursing affects psychological state and myocardial injury in reperfusion injury in patients with myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary intervention. Ninety patients with myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and were confirmed to have postoperative reperfusion injury were randomly divided into a control group that received conventional care or an intervention group that received evidence-based nursing intervention. The levels of cardiac function indicators (left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter), myocardial injury markers (N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I), psychological status (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale scores), the incidence of complications, mortality rate, and satisfaction with nursing care were compared before and after the intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, after the intervention, both groups showed reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin I levels, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale scores, with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. The intervention group demonstrated superior outcomes in all these metrics compared to the control group, with lower rates of complications and mortality, and higher satisfaction levels. Implementing evidence-based nursing in patients with myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for reperfusion injury can improve cardiac function, alleviate myocardial injury and psychological status, reduce the incidence of complications, and enhance patient satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Recent researches have revealed the potential utility of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) as biomarkers in various diseases. However, the association between plasma eccDNAs and myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear. In this study, we extracted plasma eccDNA from blood samples of individuals with acute MI and conducted Circle-Seq. We identified an MI-related eccDNA (MIRECD) with high expression levels in the plasma of patients with MI. Sanger sequencing validated its loop construction and sequence. Mechanistically, MIRECD could aggravate necroptosis via regulating the expression of mixed-lineage-kinase-domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the incidences of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and cardiovascular mortality were higher in individuals with elevated MIRECD levels. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that MIRECD independently predicted the occurrence of MACEs in patients with MI. The addition of MIRECD enhanced the discrimination and reclassification ability compared with conventional risk factors. In conclusion, our study identified a novel eccDNA, MIRECD, which might regulate myocardial necroptosis through MLKL. MIRECD has the potential to serve as a reliable indicator for predicting the prognosis and stratifying the risk of MI.",

    "abstract": "Predicting myocardial functional recovery post-myocardial infarction remains a significant challenge. Researchers are currently exploring myocardial recovery potential by examining myocardial strain characteristics. This study hypothesizes that complexity metrics, which assess waveform randomness, reflect myocardial recovery capacity, hold prognostic value, and may aid in differentiating recovery states. Thirty myocardial infarction patients underwent baseline and 1-year follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance, including cine and late gadolinium enhancement scans. Myocardial images were segmented into 16 segments per patient, totaling 480 segments, with 262 displaying initial scarring based on late gadolinium enhancement. Strain characteristics and complexity metrics, including frequency drift, were extracted, and daily segment recovery rates were computed to evaluate recovery. Based on daily segment recovery rates, scarred segments were stratified into High-recovery (37.8%), Low-recovery (38.9%), and Deteriorating (23.3%) groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the prognostic efficacy of radial/circumferential frequency drift. Correlation analysis identified associations between three complexity metrics and daily segment recovery rates (|r|>0.2), among which radial frequency drift displayed the most robust correlation (r=-0.33, P<0.001). Furthermore, an ensemble classification model using One-vs.-One strategy effectively differentiated groups (High vs. Deteriorating: 0.826, High vs. Low: 0.802, Low vs. Deteriorating: 0.708) and the ensemble model further achieved 97.71% in distinguishing four states. DeLong test results indicated that integrating complexity indices with strain characteristics yielded marked improvements in predictive performance compared to models relying solely on strain parameters (P<0.05). The complexity metrics of myocardial motion curves exhibited robust prognostic capability. As pivotal indicators of myocardial motion stability, complexity metric could serve as potent tools for providing valuable prognostic information.",

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of T1rho in evaluating the tissue characteristics of the grey area adjacent to the infarcted myocardium. A total of 40 chronic MI patients with positive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. For the MI patients, the myocardium was divided into the LGE core [5 standard deviation (SD) above remote myocardium], grey area (2-5 SD above remote myocardium), and remote myocardium based on LGE signal intensity. We compared the native T1, T1rho, and extracellular volume (ECV) values among different myocardial regions in MI patients and healthy controls and assessed their diagnostic performance in identifying grey areas. The native T1, T1rho, and ECV values were significantly different across the four myocardium categories (LGE core, grey area, remote area, and healthy controls, P<0.001). Pairwise analysis showed significant differences in these parameters between the grey and remote areas (native T1: 1,341.34±57.27 vs. 1,264.79±46.42 ms; T1rho: 53.47±4.83 vs. 44.26±2.68 ms; ECV: 36.95%±5.66% vs. 28.03%±1.87%, all P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that T1rho was a more effective discriminator between the LGE grey area and the remote area of patients [area under the curve (AUC): 0.985 vs. 0.863 and 0.982] compared to native T1 and ECV, with its Youden index reaching 0.921.

Email: yuetao-w@163.com. Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) is prevalent among patients with angina, is linked to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and is often driven by endothelial dysfunction. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the cold pressor test (CPT) in identifying individuals at elevated risk for MACEs among patients with INOCA. A total of 124 INOCA inpatients were included in the retrospective cohort study. Clinical data including age, gender, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), active smoking, and symptoms were collected from medical records. A positive CPT-myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) result was considered to be the presence of a reversible perfusion defect with a summed difference score (SDS) ≥2. The patients were routinely followed-up according to standard protocol. An MACE was defined as a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, late coronary revascularization [≥3 months following single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI], nonfatal myocardial infarction, rehospitalization due to angina, heart failure, and stroke. The number of positive CPT-MPI cases was 49 (39.5%) and that of negative CPT-MPI cases was 75 (60.5%). Compared with negative CPT-MPI, positive CPT-MPI group had a higher percentage of DM [16 (32.7%) vs. 13 (17.3%)], coronary atherosclerosis [33 (67.3%) vs. 32 (42.7%)], and ST-T segment changes on routine admission electrocardiogram (ECG) [37 (75.5%) vs. 42 (56.0%)] (all P values <0.05). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated coronary atherosclerosis as independent risk factor for positive CPT-MPI [odds ratio (OR) 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-5.90; P=0.014]. The proportion of positive CPT-MPI was higher in patients with MACEs than in patients without them [6 (32.7%) vs. 16 (8%); P <0.05]. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, only positive CPT-MPI (hazard ratio 2.97, 95% CI: 1.02-8.58; P=0.04) was significantly associated with MACE occurrence. Among patients with INOCA <39.5% had positive CPT, which was significantly related to MACE occurrence. In patients with positive CPT, the risk of MACE increased twofold. Coronary atherosclerosis was the independent risk factor of positive CPT. CPT-MPI offers valuable insights for risk stratification and treatment decision-making in patients with INOCA, particularly in identifying those at higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 2000 and October 2024 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over 1 year. The secondary outcomes were cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI). The analysis included 5 studies with 2,756 patients, indicating no significant differences between SLS and OLS regarding MACE and TVR. However, MI incidence was significantly lower with SLS, whereas OLS showed a higher MI incidence, likely due to differences in lesion length rather than the strategy itself. Subanalyses indicated that SLS significantly reduced contrast volume compared with OLS, with a trend toward shorter lesions and stent lengths. Stent overlap has minimal impact on prognosis with newer DES. Despite limitations from non-randomized data, further research is needed to optimize ldCAD treatment strategies and guide clinical practice.",

Restraining orders are a legal remedy aimed at protecting women who experience the most severe forms of stalking and interpersonal violence. Previous work has shown associations between experiences of violence and cardiovascular health among women, but little is known about the link between being stalked or obtaining a restraining order and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined whether being stalked or obtaining a restraining order considered an indicator of severe violence) were associated with a greater risk of incident CVD over 20 years in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression models among women free of CVD in 2001 when their exposure status was ascertained (n=66 270). CVD events included self-reported myocardial infarction or stroke through 2021. Analyses were adjusted for a range of covariates. Secondary analyses included examining stroke and myocardial infarction separately and confirmed (through medical records) or corroborated cases of CVD as the outcomes. The mean (SD) age in our sample was 46.3 (4.7) years in 2001. Overall, 7721 women (11.7%) reported experiencing stalking, and 3686 women (5.6%) reported obtaining a restraining order. Over follow-up (median [interquartile range] 19.9 [19.5, 20.0] years), a total of 1879 women (2.8%) reported new-onset CVD. Compared with women who had not been stalked, women who reported experiencing stalking had an increased risk of self-reported incident CVD (hazard ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.24-1.60]), adjusting for sociodemographic and childhood or family factors. Women who had, versus had not, obtained a restraining order also had an increased risk of self-reported incident CVD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.70 [95% CI,1.44-1.98]). Results were similar when considering self-reported myocardial infarction and stroke as separate outcomes and confirmed or corroborated CVD. Results were slightly attenuated but remained statistically significant when adjusted for health behaviors, medications, health conditions, childhood abuse, and depressive symptoms. Experiences of stalking and obtaining a restraining order are both associated with an increased risk of developing CVD in women. Common experiences of violence among women may affect cardiovascular health and warrant consideration alongside more traditional risk factors.",

Thus, we sought to delineate pathological microstructural alterations across temporal phases subsequent to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury utilizing q-space imaging (QSI), an advanced diffusion imaging methodology proficient in assessing the non-Gaussian diffusion patterns of molecules. Rats were subjected to IR injury, and infarct was evaluated at 2, 7, and 30 days via histopathological staining and MRI using a 9.4-Tesla system. QSI was performed with gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) for comparative assessment. Correlation coefficients among images were computed at each level of the left ventricular short-axis cross-section to juxtapose the infarct dimensions and morphology. Axial diffusivity of the kurtosis maps at 2, 7, and 30 days revealed substantial correlations with the hyperintense areas noted on T1WI (R2 = 0.885, 0.947, and 0.929, respectively). Furthermore, a strong correlation was noted with the transmural extent of infarction. Even in the absence of gadolinium contrast, the high-intensity regions delineated by QSI were concordant with the extent of pathological infarction (R2 = 0.977). These findings highlight the capability of QSI in identifying pathological changes at the infarct site, independent of gadolinium contrast media and irrespective of the temporal phase subsequent to the IR onset.",

    "abstract": "An accurate assessment of intermediate left main (LM) stenoses is crucial for revascularization decision-making. However, data on LM revascularization strategy according to instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of deferring LM revascularization according to iFR. The PHYNAL study is a prospective, multicenter registry that included consecutive patients with intermediate LM stenosis who underwent coronary physiology assessment. Patients in whom the treatment strategy (revascularization versus deferral) was based on the iFR cutoff of 0.89 were considered for the current subanalysis. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite outcome including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints were cardiac death and each component of the primary endpoint. The study population consisted of 240 patients: 188 in the deferred and 52 in the revascularized groups. At a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR: 21 to 25 months), MACE occurred in 19 patients (10 %) in the deferred and 8 patients (16 %) in the revascularized groups (HR: 1.56; 95 % CI: 0.67 to 3.60; p = 0.30) with no significant difference. Rate of all-cause death was 5 % in the deferred versus 12 % in the revascularized groups (p = 0.1), cardiac death 3 % versus 8 % (p = 0.2), non-fatal MI 1 % versus 2 % (p = 0.4), and TLR 5 % versus 2 % (p = 0.5). Deferring LM revascularization according to iFR is safe. Patients in whom LM revascularization is deferred based on iFR have comparable clinical outcomes to patients who undergo LM revascularization according to iFR.",

    "abstract": "Poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was reported to alleviate cardiomyocyte damage, but its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanism of PCBP2 in progression of MI. An in vivo MI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) branch in mice. PCBP2 expression was detected in Normal and MI groups. H9C2 cells were treated with OGD for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h to screen for optimal time to establish MI model in vitro. H9C2 cells were transfected with pcDNA-PCBP2, and the effect of PCBP2 overexpression on OGD-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and ferroptosis was evaluated. Subsequently, the interaction of PCBP2 with NDUFS1 mRNA was predicted by the Starbase database and verified by RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA-protein pull-down assay. Next, a series of reversal experiments were performed to verify the regulation of PCBP2 on NDUFS1 expression. Then, pcDNA-NDUFS1 was transfected into H9C2 and MIND4-17 (NRF2 protein activator) treated for reversal experiments to assess the effect of NDUFS1 on NRF2-mediated ferroptosis. Finally, LV-PCBP2 and LV-NDUFS1 lentiviral vectors were intrapericardially injected into MI mice, and the role of PCBP2 and NDUFS1 in the progression of MI was verified in vivo. PCBP2 was downregulated in MI model and OGD-induced H9C2 cells. PCBP2 improved cell proliferation and inhibited oxidative stress, inflammation and ferroptosis in OGD-incubated H9C2 cells. PCBP2 bound with NDUFS1 mRNA and promoted NDUFS1 expression in H9C2 cells, which promoted NRF2 activation by enhancing NRF2 nuclear translocation and inhibited NRF2-mediated ferroptosis. Finally, administration of LV-PCBP2 and LV-NDUFS1 alleviated myocardial tissue injury and MI infarct in mice through suppressing cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and inflammation. Our results suggested that PCBP2 alleviated MI by inhibiting cardiomyocyte ferroptosis through interacting with NDUFS1 mRNA and activating NRF2-Keap1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The clinical link between psoriasis (PsO) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is well-established, yet the genetic underpinnings of their comorbidity remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically map the shared genetic architecture between PsO and CVDs to identify key risk loci, effector genes, and biological pathways. We analyzed large-scale genome-wide association study data for PsO and 11 CVDs to assess their genetic correlation. We then identified pleiotropic loci-variants associated with both PsO and CVDs-and applied colocalization analysis to test whether a single causal variant at each locus could explain the shared association. To interpret these findings, we performed functional annotation to map variants to genes and conducted heritability enrichment analysis to identify critical tissues. Finally, we performed an immune-specific colocalization analysis to investigate the role of distinct immune cell types in driving the shared disease risk. The findings revealed significant shared genetic risk between PsO and seven major CVDs (e.g., hypertension, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease). We identified 58 pleiotropic loci at the level of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). Of these, 11 loci passed causal colocalization tests, indicating a high probability of a shared causal variant. Gene-level analysis pinpointed 97 candidate genes, and through multi-evidence integration, we prioritized four (SLC22A5, LMAN2, HSD3B7, and ZNF668) as high-confidence therapeutic targets. Enrichment analyses showed these shared genes are highly expressed in blood and immune-related tissues and are involved in key pathways such as immune activation and cytokine signaling. Furthermore, our findings suggest that T-cell-mediated immune dysregulation is a key mechanism underlying the comorbidity of PsO and at least five of the studied CVDs. Our systematic genetic analysis identifies shared loci and candidate genes for psoriasis and several cardiovascular diseases. The findings point toward immune-mediated pathways as potential links between these conditions and provide a prioritized list of targets warranting future functional study and therapeutic evaluation.",

This study evaluates the effects of structured exercise cardiac rehabilitation (CR) both center-based and home-based on incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and 6 min Walk Test (6MWT) in ACS patients.A systematic literature search was conducted across major databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) published from 2000 to March 2024. Random-effects model was applied for meta-analysis. Cochran's Q and I2 values were applied to determine heterogeneity, followed by subgroup analyses for exploring sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed.Ten RCTs showed that rehabilitation significantly reduced the odds of MACE compared to usual care (OR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07-0.38; p = 0.00). In terms of type of rehabilitation, center-based CR had a lower odd of MACE (OR: 0.13) than home-based CR (OR: 0.37), though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). In terms of follow-up duration, studies with ≤ 1 year follow-up reported lower MACE odds (OR: 0.10) compared to those > 1 year (OR: 0.28), also not statistically significant (p = 0.33). For functional capacity, analysis of seven studies showed that rehabilitation significantly improved 6MWT performance. Exercise-based rehabilitation led to an average increase of 86.24 m, Home-based rehabilitation showed a smaller gain of 37.63 m, with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.04).This meta-analysis provides strong evidence that CR, particularly structured exercise-based programs, significantly reduces the risk of MACE and improves functional capacity in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

Thirty patients who underwent TAVR using the left ventricular lead pacing technique between January 2022 and July 2022 were selected as the study group. The research monitored intraoperative pacing effectiveness, the successful placement of \"valve-in-valve\" during the surgical procedure, the frequency of severe complications both during and after the surgery, surgical duration, total radiation dose, and overall hospitalization expenses. Additionally, the occurrence of adverse events such as mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction within the three-month period subsequent to the surgery was documented. All patients underwent successful pacing and completed TAVR with left ventricular lead pacing, with 29 cases conducted through the transfemoral approach and 1 case through the transcarotid approach. A total of 32 interventional valves were effectively implanted, including 2 cases of \"valve-in-valve\" treatment. Intraoperative circulatory collapse occurred in 2 cases but was promptly managed and resolved. Mild paravalvular leak was observed in 25 cases post-surgery, while no significant paravalvular leaks were detected in the remaining cases. None of the patients experienced III-degree atrioventricular block or other cardiac conduction blocks necessitating temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation post-surgery. Preoperative symptoms were alleviated or completely resolved to varying extents. The average surgery duration was 86.8 ± 18.2 min, total radiation dose was 756.5 ± 131 mGy, and total hospitalization costs were 33.18 ± 2.5 ten thousand yuan (5.10 ± 0.38 ten thousand US dollars). During the three-month postoperative follow-up, no adverse events such as fatality, stroke, or myocardial infarction were reported. The use of the left ventricular lead pacing technique in TAVR demonstrates both safety and reliability.",

    "title": "Revisiting type 2 myocardial infarction: Unmet clinical needs.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is often the first clinical manifestation. Currently, the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), with different subtypes based on their pathophysiological background. While type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) is defined by an acute coronary event with plaque disruption and consequent athero-thrombosis, type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) is defined as an event due to oxygen demand and supply imbalance, unrelated to acute coronary athero-thrombosis. The differentiation between these two entities is crucial since T1MI benefits from an early invasive approach aimed at myocardial reperfusion, while in T2MI it is critical to focus on the cause of the ischemia mismatch. Furthermore, T2MI is often associated with a poorer prognosis. The presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) may significantly influence the ischemic threshold and the risk of T2MI, as it has been identified as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death and recurrent MI. The key point of contention is determining the presence of CAD in T2MI to identify patients eligible for a reperfusion strategy and to tailor therapy as well as secondary prevention strategies. In this narrative review, we aim to highlight the differences in clinical features, imaging, and biomarkers between T1MI and T2MI, emphasizing the role of CAD, in refining the diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm in T2MI.",

However, some occlusive myocardial infarctions (OMI) do not meet STEMI criteria. This study investigated whether additional ECG patterns beyond STEMI could more accurately identify OMI in OHCA patients, compared to using STEMI criteria alone. This retrospective study categorised patients based on their first post-resuscitation ECG into two groups: STEMI and non-STEMI with high-risk ECG criteria and compared them for OMI by CAG. Among 97 patients OMI was identified in 55 % (53/97) of patients, specifically in 25 of 31 with STEMI (81 %), 24 of 29 with high-risk ECG (83 %), and 4 of 37 patients with neither (11 %). Combining STEMI and high-risk ECG criteria would have predicted OMI in 92 % (49/53) of cases. Patients with high-risk ECG experienced significantly longer median delays until CAG (101.5 [IQR 63-336.75] vs. 47.5 [25.75-71.25] minutes; p = 0.004) compared to those with STEMI on the ECG. Although 30-day mortality did not differ between STEMI and high-risk ECG patients (p = 0.973), survival-differences could be observed between groups. Syntax-I-Score was significantly higher in the high-risk ECG group (29 [IQR 19-38] vs. 15 [IQR 3-24.5]; p = 0.002). Combining STEMI and high-risk ECG criteria improves OMI prediction compared to STEMI criteria alone, potentially enabling faster treatment and better OHCA survival.",

    "abstract": "Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a common form of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and approximately 25% of patients present with acute total occlusion (ATO) of the culprit vessel. ATO may lead to more extensive myocardial injury and poorer outcomes. However, its prognostic significance in NSTEMI, particularly in the Chinese population, is not well established. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the occlusion status of the culprit vessel and clinical outcomes in NSTEMI patients. This retrospective study included 1,128 NSTEMI patients who underwent coronary angiography. Patients were categorized into total occlusion (TO) and non-total occlusion (Non-TO) groups based on the occlusion status of the culprit vessel. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unplanned revascularization, and rehospitalization for heart failure. ATO was identified in 286 patients (25.4%), most frequently involving the left circumflex artery. Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years, patients in the TO group had a 46% higher risk of MACE compared to those in the Non-TO group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.83; P = 0.002). Incorporating occlusion status into the GRACE score improved its predictive accuracy for MACE. ATO of the culprit vessel was independently associated with an increased risk of MACE in NSTEMI patients. The occlusion status of the culprit vessel could aid in risk stratification and prognostic assessment in this population.",

    "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia (HLP) exacerbates myocardial cell injury by impairing lipophagy, a crucial lipid metabolic process, thereby increasing the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aims to identify biomarkers associated with HLP and lipophagy that are relevant to AMI risk through a combined transcriptomic and Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. mRNA expression data for AMI, along with genes related to HLP (HRGs) and lipophagy (LRGs), were obtained from public databases. Biomarkers were identified using differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), MR analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, augmented by two machine learning algorithms and expression validation. These biomarkers were further used to explore the role of platelet activation-related genes (PARGs) in AMI, with enrichment analysis providing insights into their underlying mechanisms. Expression of selected biomarkers was validated in clinical samples using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Three biomarkers consistently exhibited significant upregulation in AMI samples, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Specifically, PLAUR [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.115, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.006-1.237, P = 0.038] and IVNS1ABP (OR = 1.047, 95 % CI: 1.000-1.096, P = 0.048) were identified as AMI risk factors, while QKI (OR = 0.946, 95 % CI: 0.903-0.991, P = 0.020) was recognized as a protective factor. PLAUR, QKI, and IVNS1ABP demonstrated strong diagnostic performance with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.773, 0.933, and 0.807, respectively. When combined in a nomogram, the AUC reached 0.924. These genes were primarily enriched in pathways related to cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and cellular metabolism, and were notably linked to platelet activation, as evidenced by their strong associations with PARGs. In conclusion, the biomarkers PLAUR, QKI, and IVNS1ABP, associated with HLP and lipophagy, exhibit a potential causal relationship with AMI and significant diagnostic potential for predicting AMI risk, providing valuable insights for clinical diagnostics and AMI research.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained prominence as a robust tool for clinical decision-making and diagnostics, owing to its capacity to process and analyze large datasets with high accuracy. More specifically, Deep Learning, and its subclasses, have shown significant potential in image processing, including medical imaging and histological analysis. In forensic pathology, AI has been employed for the interpretation of histopathological data, identifying conditions such as myocardial infarction, traumatic injuries, and heart rhythm abnormalities. This review aims to highlight key advances in AI's role, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, in forensic neuropathology, with a focus on its ability to interpret instrumental and histopathological data to support professional diagnostics. A systematic review of the literature regarding applications of Artificial Intelligence in forensic neuropathology was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review (PRISMA) standards. We selected 34 articles regarding the main applications of AI in this field, dividing them into two categories: those addressing traumatic brain injury (TBI), including intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral microbleeds, and those focusing on epilepsy and SUDEP, including brain disorders and central nervous system neoplasms capable of inducing seizure activity. In both cases, the application of AI techniques demonstrated promising results in the forensic investigation of cerebral pathology, providing a valuable computer-assisted diagnostic tool to aid in post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) assessments of cause of death and histopathological analyses. In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the key neuropathology areas where the application of artificial intelligence can be valuable in investigating causes of death.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death worldwide, particularly affecting the elderly, a growing population. Yet, their management remains under-researched, especially in cases of multivessel coronary artery disease. These patients are at higher risk for post-procedural complications, but evidence - especially from the FIRE study (2023 - suggests that complete revascularization guided by coronary physiology (FFR or QFR) significantly reduces cardiovascular events in patients over 75, without a significant increase in complications. However, other studies like FLOWER-MI and SENIOR-RITA offer more nuanced perspectives. FLOWER-MI did not show a benefit of FFR guidance in younger patients, while SENIOR-RITA (2024) found that an invasive strategy after a non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome did not improve survival over medical therapy in very comorbid elderly patients, though it did reduce the rate of recurrent MIs. In conclusion, complete physiology-guided revascularization appears beneficial and safe for robust or mildly comorbid elderly patients, whereas a conservative approach may be preferable for more frail individuals. Treatment decisions should be individualized, considering overall health, comorbidities, life expectancy, patient preferences, and ideally discussed within a cardiogeriatric team.

    "abstract": "We report a case of a minimally invasive autopsy using postmortem contrast-enhanced computed tomography (PMeCT) by direct large-vessel puncture combined with CT-guided myocardial biopsy as a novel method to determine the cause of death. The case involved a man in his 60 s who was found dead at his residence. Postmortem CT revealed a hematoma around the heart, suggesting the possibility of a post-myocardial infarction cardiac rupture or aortic dissection. PMeCT revealed contrast agent infiltration into the myocardium and leakage into the pericardium, indicating pericardial hematoma, likely due to cardiac rupture. A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy was performed on the area of contrast infiltration, and subacute myocardial infarction was observed 3-7 days after onset. Postmortem CT angiography provides detailed vascular images and is a valuable tool for evaluating pericardial hematomas and cardiac ruptures; however, the cost of the equipment and time constraints have limited its widespread use. To address these challenges, a relatively inexpensive technique called PMeCT by direct large-vessel puncture has been developed. To our knowledge, this is the first practical demonstration of combining PMeCT by direct large-vessel puncture with CT-guided myocardial biopsy in an actual forensic death investigation. This case illustrates how this minimally invasive approach can yield both radiological and histopathological insights, potentially offering a viable alternative in cases where a conventional autopsy is not feasible. As a supplementary report to our previous technical study, this case highlights the real-world applicability and diagnostic value of the technique, especially for identifying cardiac rupture.",

We analyzed adults ≥ 65 years from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis with longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM, ≥ 5 years, n = 231) and compared them to non-DM participants (n = 1148). We evaluated CAC-based risk models (adjusted for Framingham Risk Score, race/ethnicity, and statin use) and assessed the impact of adding CCC on model performance using Cox proportional-hazards regression and Harrell's C-statistic to predict CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence. CHD events included fatal coronary events, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, adjudicated angina, and revascularization with angina. CVD events encompassed CHD, stroke (excluding transient ischemic attack), cardiovascular death, or other atherosclerotic deaths. Over 8.7 years, CVD and CHD events occurred in 17% and 10% of DM participants and 11% and 5% of non-DM participants, respectively. In longstanding DM participants, doubling of CAC was associated with higher CVD risk (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.26), with model discrimination improving from C-statistic 0.66 to 0.69 (p = 0.02) after adding CCC.

In non-DM participants, CCC did not enhance model performance for either CVD or CHD (p > 0.5). CCC, a measurable biomarker of non-cardiovascular calcification from any conventional CT, improves CVD and CHD risk prediction models' performance in older adults with longstanding DM. Question Coronary artery calcium (CAC) may have limited discriminative power for predicting cardiovascular outcomes in older adults with longstanding diabetes. Findings Costal cartilage calcification (CCC), a biomarker of non-cardiovascular calcification from CT, improves the prediction of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease risks in this population. Clinical relevance Incorporating CCC, which can be easily measured using existing CAC assessment tools on CT scans, into cardiovascular risk assessment could refine clinical decision-making and improve individualized risk stratification in older adults with longstanding diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Functional complete revascularisation (FCR) has been proven to be associated with superior prognosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. Whether guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) still impacts clinical outcomes in patients who have achieved FCR requires further evaluation. The study population was drawn from patients who achieved FCR in the FAVOR III China trial, defined as a quantitative flow ratio (QFR)-based residual functional Synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac Surgery score of 0, measured only in vessels with QFR≤0.80. GDMT was defined as the combination of single or dual antiplatelet therapy, a beta-blocker and a statin, with or without an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, according to contemporary guideline recommendations. Patients were categorised into the GDMT group (compliance with all 4 agents) or non-GDMT group (compliance with 0-3 agents). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 3 years, a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke and ischaemia-driven revascularisation. Among 3221 (85.2%) patients who achieved FCR, a total of 1964 (61.2%), 1919 (59.9%), 1545 (48.4%), 1483 (46.6%) and 1084 (35.3%) patients adhered to GDMT at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively. The MACCE occurred in 313 (10.2%) patients through 3 years. The rate of MACCE was similar between GDMT and non-GDMT groups within the first year, but significantly lower in the GDMT group from the second year (adjusted HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.85; p<0.01) and sustained until the third year (adjusted HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85; p<0.01), compared with the non-GDMT group. In patients who achieved FCR, the benefit of good adherence to GDMT remained significant, starting from the second year and continuing up to 3 years. NCT03656848.",

Secondary analysis of baseline cross-sectional data from the MOTIVATE-HF (MOTIVATional intErviewing to improve self-care in Heart Failure patients) randomised controlled trial. Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) component scores to identify distinct subgroups of patients. Demographic, clinical and psychological variables were examined as potential predictors of cluster membership. Three healthcare settings in Italy: hospital, outpatient and community-based care. 510 adult patients diagnosed with HF (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV) with poor self-care were included. Patients with severe cognitive impairment or recent myocardial infarction were excluded. Primary outcome: Sleep quality, measured using the PSQI, analysed through LCA to identify sleep disturbance clusters. Secondary outcomes included demographic and clinical characteristics predicting cluster membership. The mean age was 72.4 years (SD=12.3), with most participants married or partnered (62%) and retired or unemployed (83.9%). Mild comorbidities were present in 53.3% of the sample (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)=2.91, SD=1.98), and 61.4% were classified in NYHA class II. Three sleep quality clusters emerged: (1) adequate sleep duration but disturbed sleep and daytime dysfunction (46.1%); (2) severe sleep problems with low use of sleeping medications (25.3%); and (3) minor sleep problems with mild disturbances (28.6%).

This study assessed the accuracy of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator (NSQIP-SRC), Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) calculator, and Vascular Quality Initiative Cardiac Risk Index (VQI-CRI) calculators in predicting adverse event rates for common vascular procedures. A retrospective cohort of all carotid endarterectomy (CEA), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), infrainguinal bypass, open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and suprainguinal bypass procedures completed in a single hospital system between January 2020 - January 2023 was assembled. Preoperative demographics, medical history, and postoperative adverse events were collected through chart review. Preoperative data was entered into each calculator to produce a predicted risk of adverse events. These predicted adverse event rates were compared to the actual adverse event rates observed; comparison was conducted via χ2 goodness-of-fit tests. 952 procedures were included, comprising 348 CEA, 33 open AAA repair, 218 EVAR, 258 infrainguinal bypass, and 95 suprainguinal bypass procedures. In conglomerate, the RCRI significantly overestimated 30-day postoperative cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction (p<0.0001); the VQI-CRI also significantly overestimated in-hospital postoperative myocardial infarction (p=0.0035). The NSQIP-SRC significantly underestimated severe complications (p<0.0001), any complications (p<0.0001), UTI (p<0.0001), renal failure (p=0.0344), and return to the OR (p<0.0001), while significantly overestimating SSI (p=0.0027) and discharge to nursing/rehabilitation (p<0.0001). By procedure, the RCRI significantly overestimated risk for CEA (p<0.0001) and EVAR (p=0.0014), while significantly underestimating risk for open AAA repairs (p=0.0259). The VQI-CRI significantly overestimated risk for infrainguinal bypass (p=0.0038).

During the onset of cardiovascular diseases, many innate immune cells accumulate at the lesion sites. Their continuously augmented recruitment and effector function typically drive the progression of pathological processes and often coincide with cardiovascular events during their peak activities. It is essential to comprehensively understand the influence of the circadian clock on the trafficking and function of innate immune cells, as this influence exerts profound impacts on the immune and inflammatory responses to specific cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Proposing innate immunotherapy targeting the circadian clock is anticipated to offer valuable insights for the prevention and management strategies of cardiovascular diseases.",

A better understanding of how risk profiles and outcomes differ by age may allow for targeted treatment and prevention strategies. PARADISE-MI randomized 5661 adults without prior heart failure (HF) to sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril within 0.5 to 7 days of a MI complicated by pulmonary congestion and/or LVEF ≤40%. Associations between age and clinical outcomes were analyzed using Cox models, adjusted for potential confounders. Mean age was 63.7 ± 11.5 years. Patients aged ≥75 years (n = 1051, 18.6%) were more often women, had more atrial fibrillation and lower eGFR. They more commonly presented with non-ST-segment elevation MI and were less likely to receive primary reperfusion and guideline-based medical therapies. Age was associated with all-cause death (HR 1.54 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.68) and was more strongly associated with non-CV death (HR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.56) than with CV death (HR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.57).

The treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril was not significantly modified by age (p-interaction = 0.19) and tolerability did not differ by treatment arm. In conclusion, the heightened risk of death, HF and stroke after MI with advancing age was not explained by differences in clinical characteristics.

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ASTEMI). Nonetheless, its impact on left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial strain in this population is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of MAFLD on left ventricular function and strain parameters in patients with ASTEMI using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). This retrospective study included 318 patients with ASTEMI (113 MAFLD and 205 non-MAFLD) undergoing CMR and non-enhanced computed tomography. Left ventricular function, global radial strain (GRS), global circumferential strain (GCS), and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of MAFLD on left ventricular function and global strain in patients with ASTEMI. Patients with MAFLD demonstrated significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (53.35 % vs. 59.64 %, P < 0.001), left ventricular global function index (LVGFI) (27.24 vs. 29.23, P = 0.006), and reduced absolute values of global strain in all three directions (GRS: 16.90 % vs. 18.80 %; GCS: 11.90 % vs. 12.90 %; GLS: 8.80 % vs. 10.90 %; all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MAFLD was an independent predictor of LVEF (β = -0.112, P = 0.028), LVGFI (β = - 0.109, P = 0.034), and multidirectional strain parameters (GRS, GCS, and GLS) (all P < 0.05). Moreover, increased MAFLD severity was correlated with a numerical deterioration in both left ventricular function parameters and global strain values.

    "abstract": "Prediction of incident macrovascular events (iMEs) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains suboptimal. We aim to discover blood-based epigenetic biomarkers predicting iMEs in 752 newly diagnosed individuals with T2D, among whom 102 developed iMEs during follow-up. 461 DNA methylation sites, e.g., near ARID3A, GATA5, HDAC4, IRS2, and TMEM51, associate with iMEs. Using cross-validation, a methylation risk score (MRS) containing 87 sites predicts iMEs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 and an AUC of 0.84 for the combination of MRS and clinical risk factors, better than SCORE2-Diabetes (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2-Diabetes), UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), Framingham, and polygenic risk scores (AUCs = 0.54-0.62). This epigenetic biomarker has a negative predictive value of 95.9% and improves the classification of iMEs with continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) showing 90.2% improvement versus clinical factors. Atherosclerotic versus non-atherosclerotic aortas show 78 differentially methylated sites. We validate 32 sites in EPIC-Potsdam and 43 in OPTIMED cohorts, including an MRS (AUC = 0.80). Together, blood-based epigenetic biomarkers predict iMEs better than clinical risk factors, supporting its future clinical use.",

    "title": "Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MΑSLD)",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MΑSLD) is a broad term used to cover a spectrum of conditions characterized by evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology. MASLD is a broad term used to encompass a spectrum of conditions characterized by evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology in patients with at least 1 metabolic risk factor (eg, obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension). MASLD represents a significant evolution in the terminology and conceptual framework surrounding hepatic steatosis. Historically, liver fat accumulation without significant alcohol intake was categorised under nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, recent shifts in nomenclature arose primarily to address 2 core issues. Firstly, the term \"fatty\" was replaced with \"steatotic\" to mitigate the stigma associated with the former term. Secondly, defining a disease by exclusion, eg, \"nonalcoholic,\" was widely criticised for its inherent ambiguity and lack of specificity, akin to labelling conditions like myocardial infarction as \"non-cocaine myocardial infarction,\" which is considered conceptually inadequate. The pivotal shift in terminology was initiated by the landmark paper from Eslam et al, introducing the term Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD), thereby directly associating hepatic steatosis with underlying metabolic dysfunction rather than excluding alcohol consumption alone. This redefinition marked a significant departure from NAFLD, emphasizing pathophysiological mechanisms linked to components of metabolic syndrome. Subsequently, following broader international consensus, MAFLD was refined further to MASLD, establishing clearer diagnostic criteria and positioning it within a broader spectrum of conditions collectively termed Steatotic Liver Disease (SLD). This evolution reflects a more precise and mechanistically informed approach to understanding hepatic steatosis, enhancing clinical and research clarity. Types of Steatotic Liver Disease Steatotic liver disease is categorized into the following types: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): MASLD is defined by ≥5% hepatic steatosis and the presence of at least 1 cardiometabolic risk factor (eg, dyslipidemia or obesity), with no other underlying causes and minimal or no alcohol intake (ie, <20 g/day for females and <30 g/day for males). Formerly known as NAFLD, MASLD is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH): MASH, previously called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a progressive form of MASLD marked by liver inflammation and hepatocellular injury, with or without fibrosis. Metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated liver disease (MetALD): MetALD refers to patients with hepatic steatosis, at least 1 metabolic risk factor, and moderate alcohol consumption, defined as 20 to 50 g/day for females and 30 to 60 g/day for males. This condition may result from a combination of metabolic dysfunction and moderate alcohol consumption, representing a spectrum between MASLD-predominant and alcohol-predominant disease. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD): Patients with steatosis and heavy alcohol use (>50 g/day for females, >60 g/day for males), with a standard drink containing approximately 14 g of alcohol, are classified with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Although MASLD can coexist with other causes of steatosis, eg, celiac disease, medications, or genetic conditions, this discussion focuses on MASLD in the absence of those factors. A diagnostic approach for steatotic liver diseases (SLD) other than MASLD, MetALD, and ALD has been established, highlighting critical clinical features and recommended investigations (see Image. Steatotic Liver Disease Diagnosis). Understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of MASLD and its subtypes is critical for clinicians, emphasizing the need for interprofessional collaboration in diagnosis and management. The cardiometabolic risk factors defining metabolic dysfunction include: : Excess adiposity. Body-mass index (BMI): A BMI of ≥25 kg/m² in the general population or  ≥23 kg/m² in individuals of Asian ancestry. Central (visceral) obesity (waist circumference thresholds): • Waist circumference of  ≥94 cm in men and  ≥80 cm in women of European ancestry • Waist circumference of  ≥90 cm in men and  ≥80 cm in women of South-Asian or Chinese ancestry • Waist circumference of  ≥85 cm in men and  ≥90 cm in women of Japanese ancestry. Disorders of glucose metabolism. Prediabetes: Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7% to 6.4 %; fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dL. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: HbA1c of  ≥6.5%; fasting plasma glucose of  ≥126 mg/dL. Hypertriglyceridemia: Plasma triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or treatment with lipid-lowering agents. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: <40 mg/dL in men or ≤50 mg/dL in women. Arterial hypertension: Resting blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg or greater or ongoing antihypertensive treatment.",

    "title": "Applications of Ballistocardiogram in the Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease: Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) continues to account for a substantial proportion of deaths worldwide. Ballistocardiogram (BCG), a noncontact, noninvasive technique for monitoring cardiac activity, has gained increasing attention for its potential role in various medical applications, particularly in CHD. This review comprehensively explores the applications of BCG in the diagnostic evaluation of CHD. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical applications and diagnostic capabilities of BCG in CHD, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the precision of CHD management and optimizing therapeutic decision-making pathways. A literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines to identify studies evaluating the use of BCG in CHD. The initial search identified 500 studies. Based on titles, abstracts, and keywords, 266 studies were selected for further review. Following further exclusion of non-English articles, animal studies, and review articles, 38 eligible studies were included in the final analysis. Among the 38 studies, 22 focused on the application of BCG in acute coronary syndrome. These studies explored various aspects, including BCG waveforms in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, and the relationship between age and the rate of abnormal BCG waveforms. The remaining studies covered the effects of drugs, emotions, exercise, and other variables on BCG recordings in patients with CHD. Sample sizes varied significantly across the studies, 36 studies explicitly reported sample sizes, encompassing a total of 9479 participants with individual study sizes ranging from 1 to 903 cases. Notably, 13 studies enrolled fewer than 50 participants, raising concerns about potential selection bias and reduced reliability of the findings. Overall, while BCG demonstrates significant potential in the diagnosis and prevention of CHD, several limitations remain. Variability in study design, sample size, and outcome measures poses challenges to the generalizability of findings. Nevertheless, the capability of BCG to reflect cardiac function and assist in the detection of CHD remains valuable. With continued research and technological advancement, BCG has the potential to transform current approaches to CHD diagnosis and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Cangrelor is the only parenteral P2Y12 receptor antagonist currently recommended for the prevention of periprocedural thrombotic complications in P2Y12 inhibitor-naïve patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the pharmacological properties and administration strategies of cangrelor in PCI, summarizes the latest evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies, and discusses potential future directions for its application in clinical practice. Literature search was conducted using PubMed up to May 2025. Cangrelor provides rapid platelet inhibition following an intravenous bolus, and its short half-life ensures predictable pharmacokinetic profile, facilitating perioperative management. The CHAMPION program demonstrated that cangrelor significantly reduces early ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI. Since its approval, several clinical trials and observational studies have further evaluated the efficacy and safety of cangrelor and its optimal use. The adoption of cangrelor in catheterization laboratories worldwide remains inconsistent, with misuse being frequently reported. Drug-related costs along with concerns surrounding drug interaction when switching to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, limited safety data in high-risk populations and lack of evidence on the comparison against ticagrelor or prasugrel may contribute to its restricted utilization in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Kidney disease is a known, independent driver of cardiovascular disease. While dietary sodium and potassium intake, approximated via urinary excretion, are known cardiac risk factors in the general population, their role for prevention in persons with kidney disease is unclear. Thus, we studied the relationship between the ratio of urinary sodium-to-potassium excretion and incident cardiovascular disease in individuals with chronic kidney disease. We included 2,342 adults with chronic kidney disease enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort free of cardiovascular disease on study entry. Urinary sodium and potassium were measured via 24-hour urine collection at the baseline visit. Primary study outcomes included atrial fibrillation [AF], heart failure (overall, reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] and preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]), and myocardial infarction [MI]. Incidence rates (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated per 1000 person-years. Nested models were created using Cox regression and adjusted for sociodemographic data (age, sex and race/ethnicity), lifestyle habits (body mass index and cigarette smoking), medication use, medical comorbidities and renal characteristics. Among the study population, mean (SD) age was 56 (11) years and mean estimated glomerular filtrate rate was 51 (20) mL/min/1.73 m2. The highest quartile (versus lowest quartile) of urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio was associated with a 1.4-fold increased risk of overall HF (HR 1.44, CI 95% 1.05-1.98), 1.9-fold increased risk of HFrEF (HR 1.90, CI 95% 1.08-3.36) and 1.5-fold increased risk of AF (HR 1.48, CI 95% 1.03-2.13) after adjustment for the covariates above. We did not find an association with incident MI (HR 1.14, CI 95% 0.78-1.68) and HFpEF (HR 1.18, CI 95% 0.75-1.87). A higher ratio of urinary sodium-to-potassium excretion was associated with incident AF and HF (particularly HFrEF), but not MI, in persons with chronic kidney disease. Dietary sodium and potassium represent possible modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease prevention in individuals with kidney disease.",

The limited representation of the Pakistani population in genetic studies motivated us to design this study. The objective of this study is to identify the genetic variants within the PCSK9 gene and its possible association with myocardial infarction (MI) in Pakistani Pashtun population. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed to pinpoint and propose pathogenic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MI. Subsequent, MassARRAY genotyping and rigorous statistical analyses were used to confirmthe association of WES reported variants with MI. Exome sequencing identified n=5 SNPs in PCSK9. Of the five reported variants, SNPs rs2483205 (OR = 1.429, 95% CI = 0.925-2.207, p = 0.061) and rs562556 (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.274-4.906, p = 0.001) showed strong positive association with myocardial infarction (MI).Whereas SNPs rs540796, rs509504, and rs505151 (p > 0.05) showed no association with MI in the study population. Genotypic distribution of SNPs rs562556 and rs2483205 were reported significant different between MI cases and controls (p < 0.05). Moreover recessive model (TT + CT versus CC) for rs2483205 and the dominant model (GG + AG versus AA) for rs562556 demonstrated strong associations with MI. The present study identified potential genetic markers increasing susceptibility/risk of MI in the study population. Our study provides a platform for future large scale genetic studies and identifying individuals who at risk of developing MI.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two leading causes of death in the world. Studies show a close mutually aggravating relationship between arterial hypertension (AH) and COPD. Antihypertensive therapy in patients with AH and COPD has a number of features, aiming to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality from CVD without worsening lung function. To analyze the data of patients with AH and COPD included in the national registry to determine the burden of CVD risk factors, concomitant cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, gout and characteristics of antihypertensive therapy. A comparative analysis of patients of the hypertension registry (conducted in outpatient clinics) was performed depending on the presence (n=3323) or absence (n=54073) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Statistical analysis of the obtained data were performed using the R 4.3.3 statistical computing environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The prevalence of COPD in patients with hypertension was 5.8% (3323 cases). The presence of COPD in patients with hypertension, regardless of gender and age, was statistically significantly associated with higher odds of having coronary artery disease [odds ratio (OR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-2.38; p<0.001], a history of myocardial infarction (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.59-1.87; p<0.001), chronic heart failure (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.82-2.1; p<0.001), a history of acute cerebrovascular accident (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.46; p=0.004), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.31-3.59; p<0.001), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.45-1.93; p<0.001). Patients with hypertension and COPD more often received drugs from the group of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists than patients with hypertension without COPD (22.7% vs 17.7%). The prescription of drugs from the group of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and COPD was lower by 4%. Cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, gout, obstructive sleep apnea in patients with hypertension and COPD are more common. Patients with COPD and hypertension have a higher incidence of risk factors, CVD and comorbid pathologies. They require closer attention during examination and during the selection of antihypertensive therapy. In patients with hypertension and COPD, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are prescribed less frequently than in patients with hypertension without COPD due to possible side effects and contraindications. Актуальность. Сердечно-сосудистые заболевания (ССЗ) и хроническая обструктивная болезнь легких (ХОБЛ) – две основные причины смерти в мире. Исследования показывают тесную взаимоотягчающую связь артериальной гипертонии (АГ) и ХОБЛ. Антигипертензивная терапия (АГТ) у больных АГ и ХОБЛ имеет ряд особенностей, ее цель – снижение риска развития сердечно-сосудистых осложнений и смертности от ССЗ без ухудшения функции легких. Цель. Проанализировать данные больных АГ и ХОБЛ, включенных в национальный регистр, для определения отягощенности факторами сердечно-сосудистого риска (ССР), сопутствующими ССЗ, цереброваскулярными заболеваниями и хронической болезнью почек, ожирением, сахарным диабетом, подагрой, а также особенностей АГТ. Материалы и методы. Выполнен сравнительный анализ пациентов регистра АГ (проводился в амбулаторно-поликлинических учреждениях) в зависимости от наличия (n=3323) или отсутствия (n=54 073) ХОБЛ. Статистический анализ полученных данных проводили с использованием среды для статистических вычислений R 4.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Вена, Австрия). Результаты. Распространенность ХОБЛ у пациентов с АГ составила 5,8% (3323 случая). Наличие ХОБЛ у пациентов с АГ вне зависимости от пола и возраста было статистически значимо ассоциировано с более высокими шансами ишемической болезни сердца [отношение шансов (ОШ) 2,21, 95% доверительный интервал (ДИ) 2,06–2,38; p<0,001], инфаркта миокарда в анамнезе (ОШ 1,73, 95% ДИ 1,59–1,87; p<0,001), хронической сердечной недостаточности (ОШ 1,95, 95% ДИ 1,82–2,1; p<0,001), острого нарушения мозгового кровообращения в анамнезе (ОШ 1,25, 95% ДИ 1,07–1,46; p=0,004), транзиторной ишемической атаки (ОШ 2,9, 95% ДИ 2,31–3,59; p<0,001), фибрилляции предсердий (ОШ 1,68, 95% ДИ 1,45–1,93; p<0,001). Больные АГ и ХОБЛ по сравнению с больными АГ без сопутствующей ХОБЛ чаще получали препараты из группы антагонистов рецепторов к ангиотензину II (22,7% vs 17,7%). Препараты из группы b-адреноблокаторов больным АГ и ХОБЛ назначали реже на 4%, чем больным АГ без ХОБЛ. Факторы ССР, сопутствующие заболевания, такие как сахарный диабет, подагра, обструктивное апноэ сна, у больных АГ и ХОБЛ встречались чаще. Заключение. Пациенты с ХОБЛ и АГ имеют большую частоту факторов риска ССЗ и коморбидных патологий. Они требуют более пристального внимания при обследовании и во время подбора АГТ. Пациентам с АГ и ХОБЛ ингибиторы ангиотензинпревращающего фермента и b-адреноблокаторы назначают реже, чем пациентам с АГ без ХОБЛ, из-за возможных побочных эффектов и противопоказаний.",

We included 1807 cases and 2923 controls (median age 59 years, 20% women) in the analyses. After adjusting for potential confounding, we found an independent association between the 3 risk factors and VF: family history of SD (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.38-1.87), previous AF (OR 1.95, 1.22-3.11), and anterior myocardial infarction (OR 1.55, 1.36-1.75). Further investigation indicated increased effect of family history with multiple SDs in the family, a stronger effect of AF on VF developing within the first minutes of symptoms, and the effect of anterior infarctions being modified by enzymatically determined infarct size. Family history of SD, history of AF, and anterior infarct location were all independently and additively associated with an increased risk of VF in patients with a first STEMI.",

    "abstract": "Immunity, particularly T lymphocytes, plays an important role in the development of arterial hypertension. Moreover, the so-called neuro-immune axis has been identified as a crucial crossroads, occurring in the spleen and involving placental growth factor as the principal mediator. However, no studies in humans have yet investigated the role of the spleen in hypertension and vascular damage. In this retrospective, case-control, single-blind study, we enrolled patients who had previously undergone elective splenectomy (cases) and subjects who had undergone elective cholecystectomy (controls). All subjects underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, evaluation of retinal arteriole morphology by adaptive optics, capillary density assessment by video-capillaroscopy, arterial stiffness measurements, and analysis of T lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry. Fifty patients were included: 25 (50%) cases and 25 (50%) controls. No difference in hypertension prevalence (P = 0.39) or cumulative incidence (P = 0.79) of new diagnoses was detected. Splenectomized patients displayed lower 24-h (P = 0.024) and daytime (P = 0.011) diastolic blood pressure compared to cholecystectomized patients. Similar results were obtained for retinal structural parameters, capillary density, and arterial stiffness between the groups. A significant impact of splenectomy on the relationship between 24-h diastolic BP and wall cross-sectional area (P-interaction = 0.019) and forearm capillary density recruitment (P-interaction = 0.020) was found. A higher number and percentage of CD3+CD8+ T cells were observed in splenectomized patients compared to cholecystectomized patients (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively), although no differences in cytokine production patterns were detected. For the first time, our results support the role of the spleen in blood pressure control in humans.

Based on the ICD-10-CM codes recorded between 2000 and 2022, patients with hypertensive crisis were subdivided into hypertensive urgencies (HU) and hypertensive emergencies (HE). In those with HE, the type of target organ damage was reported, i.e. central nervous system (ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke and hypertensive encephalopathy), cardiovascular (myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), aorta dissection (AD)), or renal (acute kidney failure). Primary outcomes were the one-year risks of all-cause death, and major cardiovascular events (MACE: MI, stroke, cardiac arrest, AD, and HF). Secondary outcomes were the risks for each type of MACE and the incident risk of Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Cox regression analysis after propensity score matching (PSM) 1 : 1 was used to produce hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CIs). Overall, we identified 27 721 patients with HE (age 62.4 ± 15.7, 46.3% females) and 23 478 patients with HU (age 63.4 ± 17.3, 55.8% females).

Of the secondary outcomes, patients with HE had increased risks of MI, stroke, cardiac arrest, AD, acute HF, AD and incident AF. All the different types of organ involvement were associated with similar long-term risks of adverse events. During follow-up, 4% of patients with HU progressed to HE. Young age, female sex, Black or Asian ethnicity, smoking, secondary hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease were identified as the main risk factors. Patients with HE have a high long-term risk of all-cause death, MACE and incident AF. Preventing the onset of target organ damage in patients with hypertensive crisis is crucial to mitigate their long-term risk of adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) represent a novel treatment option for coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR). The AGENT DCB (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) demonstrated superior efficacy in treating ISR compared to uncoated balloons in randomized controlled trials. However, real-world data on AGENT DCB safety remains limited. This study sought out to evaluate post-marketing adverse event reports related to the AGENT DCB. This study analyzed post-marketing adverse event reports submitted to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between March 1, 2024, and March 1, 2025, specifically focusing on coronary interventions utilizing the AGENT DCB. Reports were independently reviewed and categorized by device-related complications, patient injuries, and device failures. Data were summarized descriptively, and limitations inherent to the MAUDE database were considered. After screening and excluding duplicates, 155 reports on the AGENT DCB were included. Among all reports, device malfunctions without injury were most common (56.77%), followed by patient injury (30.97%) and death (12.26%). Of the total reported device problems, balloon rupture (33.55%) and shaft breakage (10.32%) were predominant. Injuries reported included angina (32.84%), acute myocardial infarction (29.85%), and coronary perforation (8.95%). Notably, 30 MAUDE reports described off-label treatment of de novo lesions; these off-label cases exhibited similar injury rates compared to ISR-treated lesions (53.33% vs. 57.89%). Real-world analysis of FDA MAUDE reports revealed frequent device malfunctions, mainly balloon rupture and shaft breakage, and patient complications such as angina, myocardial infarction, and coronary perforation. The off-label use for de novo lesions highlights the need for caution and further clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Direct oral anticoagulants and percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices were approved for use in 2010 and 2015, respectively. It is unknown to what extent, if any, these new stroke preventive therapies have impacted hospitalizations for thromboembolic (TE) events. To evaluate temporal trends in AF-related hospitalizations for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and systemic embolism (SEE) in the U.S. from 2010 to 2021. Using the National Inpatient Sample, we identified hospitalizations for TE events with comorbid AF. Data were grouped into two periods (2010-2015 and 2016-2021). Linear regression assessed trends in TE frequency. We also examined anticoagulation (AC) use and LAAO procedures among inpatients with AF. A total of 1,692,373 AF-related TE hospitalizations were identified: 798,413 (2010-2015) and 893,960 (2016-2021). The frequency of hospitalizations for any AF-TE event, as a fraction of total hospitalizations in patients with AF, declined from 3.69 % to 3.35 % (P < 0.001). AF-related AIS hospitalizations rose from 2.71 % to 2.89 % in 2010-2015 (P < 0.001) but declined from 3.02 % to 2.89 % in 2016-2021 (P < 0.001). TIA (0.75 % to 0.35 %) and SEE (0.22 % to 0.10 %) hospitalizations also decreased (P < 0.001). AC use increased from 21.2 % in 2010 to 42.4 % in 2021 (P < 0.001), while LAAO procedures rose sharply from 5129 in 2016 to 46,080 in 2021 (P < 0.001). TE hospitalizations among inpatients with comorbid AF declined from 2010 to 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in TIAs and SEE. Acute ischemic stroke hospitalizations declined after 2016, coinciding with increased AC use and LAAO adoption.",

    "abstract": "Background: Uptake of evidence-based care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is limited in Tanzania. To address this, a tailored intervention, the Multicomponent Intervention to Improve Acute Myocardial Infarction Care (MIMIC), was co-designed by an interdisciplinary team. Objectives: To determine implementation outcomes from a pilot trial of the MIMIC intervention in a Tanzanian emergency department (ED). Methods: The MIMIC intervention was implemented by the ED staff for one year. Fidelity, penetration, and costs were observed for each of the intervention components: designated champions to audit care, an online training module for staff, a triage card for nurses to flag patients with AMI symptoms, pocket cards summarizing AMI management for physicians, and an educational pamphlet for patients. Thirty days following enrollment, patient participants were contacted via telephone to inquire whether they had read the pamphlet. Results: Physician champions and nurse champions were actively engaged in the intervention across the twelve-month study period. Fidelity to the pocket card was excellent, with all 22 (100%) physicians observed to have ever brought their pocket cards to work, and penetration across physician-shifts was 96.1% (1835/1910). The training module was started by 20 out of the 22 (91%) physicians and 25 of the 32 (78%) nurses observed. Penetration, measured by module completion, was the same for physicians (20 of 22, 91%) but lower among nurses (21 of 32, 65.6%). Triage cards were used for 453 out of the 577 (78.5%) patients with chest pain or dyspnea. Fidelity to patients with AMI receiving the educational pamphlet was 37.6% (53 of 141). Only 22 of the 39 (56%) surviving AMI patients who received the pamphlet reported reading it, with most of the rest reporting being unaware that they had received it. The total annual cost of the MIMIC intervention was USD 1324.24. Conclusions: There was high variability in fidelity and penetration of the individual intervention components. Future studies should explore reasons for incomplete penetration and analyze cost-effectiveness for scale-up efforts across Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "While extensive evidence linking human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), several studies have also suggested an association between HIV and presumed sudden cardiac death (PSCD). Our objective was to evaluate the association between HIV and PSCD compared to AMI. Understanding whether HIV confers differential risks for distinct cardiovascular outcomes is essential to guide prevention strategies and risk stratification in this population. The study design was a case-control study. We combined data from the large prospective population-based Paris Sudden Death Expertise Center Registry on PSCD and from the French National Health Insurance (SNDS) database. The SNDS database contains comprehensive data on all reimbursements for health-related expenditures and detailed medical information on all admissions to French public and private hospitals. In this study, adult patients with PSCD that occurred between 2011 and 2020 in Paris and the 3 adjacent departments were matched with AMI controls. We identified HIV patients in the 2 populations. We used a logistic regression to estimate the association between HIV and PSCD compared to HIV and AMI, adjusted for confounders. In this study, 22,510 PSCD patients (60% men, age 71 (17) years) were matched with 22,510 AMI controls (60% men, age 72 (17) years). Among them, 245 (1%) and 104 (1%) had a positive HIV status preceding PSCD and AMI respectively. The odds of PSCD was 97% higher than the odds of AMI in HIV patients (adjusted odds-ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval: 1.55-2.49). Our findings, based on big data analysis, strongly suggest a significant association between HIV status and PSCD, also among patients without a history of AMI. The underlying mechanisms still remain incompletely defined and further studies are needed.",

Mitophagy plays an important role in MIRI, and the cGAS-STING signaling pathway can participate in mitophagy in a variety of ways. The purpose of this study was to explore the new molecular mechanism by which levosimendan exerts cardioprotective effects in order to provide a new experimental basis for the clinical application of levosimendan. In this study, an isolated MIRI rat model was established, and 48 rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12): continuous perfusion group (Group C), ischemia-reperfusion group (IR group), ischemia-reperfusion + levosimendan group (IR + L group), and ischemia-reperfusion + levosimendan + sting activator group (IR + LA group). The hemodynamic indices, myocardial infarction volume, expression of cGAS-STING signaling pathway proteins, and mitophagy-related proteins in isolated rat hearts of the four groups were compared. This study showed that levosimendan can reduce the level of myocardial mitophagy in ischemia-reperfusion rats by inhibiting the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, reducing myocardial injury, and playing a myocardial protective role.",

    "abstract": "Interventional cardiology has recently advanced with innovations such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a transformative tool. This systematic review explored the current landscape, methodologies, and applications of AI in interventional cardiology. A comprehensive literature search was conducted following preferred reporting guidelines, identifying 20 studies after data extraction and quality assessment. AI-particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-enhances diagnostic accuracy and procedural efficiency. ML aids in arrhythmia detection and coronary plaque characterization, while DL supports imaging interpretation, robotic navigation, and catheter tracking. Clinical applications show AI's potential in predicting myocardial infarction, guiding personalized treatment, and improving resource management. Despite these benefits, challenges such as data privacy, algorithm transparency, and generalizability remain. Addressing these requires collaborative efforts and robust data sharing. Future priorities include integrating AI into routine clinical workflows, resolving regulatory barriers, and ensuring interpretability. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to address ethical considerations and uphold patient safety. The integration of AI in interventional cardiology offers significant potential to enhance patient care, procedural precision, and resource utilization. However, its adoption must be guided by careful attention to ethical, technical, and regulatory constraints. Overcoming these barriers through coordinated efforts may allow AI to redefine standards in cardiovascular care and enable a more precise, efficient, and patient-centered approach to interventional cardiology.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is increasingly recognized as a modifiable prognostic factor in myocardial infarction (MI), yet traditional nutritional assessment methods often fail to adequately capture lipid-related atherogenic risk. We introduced an innovative modified Controlling Nutritional Status (mCONUT) score, which replaces total cholesterol with non-HDL cholesterol, aiming to improve the stratification of atherosclerotic risk and to assess its prognostic utility in predicting MI outcomes. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed a total of 3,730 patients diagnosed with MI, extracted from the MIMIC-IV database, and stratified them into Normal, Mild, and Worse groups based on the mCONUT score. After performing 1:1:1 propensity score matching, we selected 993 patients for comparative analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and demographic confounders, were employed to evaluate all-cause mortality at 180 days and 1 year. Among 993 MI patients, the median age was 75 years (IQR 68-82) with 58.4% males (n = 580). Malnutrition severity (mCONUT ≥6) stratified prognostic risk: Worse group demonstrated progressive mortality increases (180-day: 13.9% vs. Normal 7.85%, p = 0.037; 1-year: 31.4% vs. 21.2%, p = 0.011), alongside lower BMI, extended hospitalization, reduced hypertension, higher CKD incidence, and diminished revascularization (all p < 0.05). Multivariable analyses confirmed graded mortality risk: 180-day (Model 1: adjusted HR 1.58, p = 0.009; Model 2: HR 1.46, p = 0.031) and 1-year (Model 1: HR 1.61, p = 0.002; Model 2: HR 1.52, p = 0.008). Consistency across subgroups was observed, with heightened vulnerability in males, hypertensives (interaction p = 0.004), diabetes and non-white individuals. The mCONUT score has emerged as a robust multidimensional biomarker for predicting MI prognosis, with worse malnutrition (mCONUT ≥ 6) being significantly associated with a 46%-61% elevation in mortality risk, demonstrating a clear linear dose-response relationship. Routine screening and tailored nutritional interventions should be prioritized in modern MI management practices.",

    "title": "Matrix Stiffening Induces Mechanical Memory and Nuclear Fragility in Cardiomyocytes via Microtubule-Lamin Coupling.",
    "abstract": "Mechanical memory (MM) describes the persistent phenotypic remodeling following exposure to a transient extrinsic biomechanical cue. Short-term biomechanical stress is a feature of several etiologies of cardiomyopathy, including dysfunction of the viable myocardium following a large myocardial infarction. However, the nuclear mechanisms linking stiffness to persistent cellular remodeling remain poorly understood. We cultured human iPSC-cardiomyocytes on a magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) with tunable stiffness (9-56 kPa) to mimic physiological and pathological myocardium. This allowed us to assess how transient increases in stiffness influence cellular responses such as nuclear structure, and DNA damage in hiPSC-cardiomyocytes. Using a combination of Immunofluorescence imaging, Western Blot and pharmacological interventions, we examined the role of microtubule detyrosination and the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex in transducing mechanical signals from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus with a focus on MM induction. Short-term (6 h) stiff priming induced reversible phenotypic changes upon resoftening. However, 48 h of stiff priming triggered persistent MM, characterized by nuclear rupture, increased lamin A/C expression, DNA damage, and cytoplasmic leakage of DNA repair factors like KU80. Disruption of either a-tubulin detyrosination or the LINC complex prevented MM and nuclear damage, indicating that these elements are essential for nuclear mechanotransduction. In contrast, depletion of lamin A/C or DNA repair components accelerated stiffness-induced phenotypes and promoted MM onset within 6 hours. Finally, inhibition of a-tubulin detyrosination using ADV-TTL reversed both MM and DNA damage. Acceleration of MM induction by lamin knockdown suggests that hereditary laminopathies may be associated with increased cardiomyocyte vulnerability to transient mechanical stress inducing DNA damage and senescence. Conversely, the protective effects of limiting stiffness-induced α-tubulin detyrosination, or nuclear mechano-transduction suggest potential cardioprotective strategies in the setting of laminopathies and/or sustained increases in extracellular matrix stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Kidney stone incidence and recurrence are increasing, which poses significant health problems. The Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) combines body mass index (BMI), albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). It was first created to predict outcomes for cancer patients. Recently, it has been studied as an indicator of overall inflammation and nutrition in other diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and asthma. This study aimed to evaluate the association between ALI scores and kidney stone risk in adult men, and to assess the potential utility of ALI as an indicative biomarker. We analyzed data from 5,429 male participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2007-2018). Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between ALI scores and the risk of kidney stones. Non-linear associations were further explored with smoothed curve fitting. The predictive value of ALI was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of findings across different demographic and clinical characteristics. Out of all participants, 572 (10.5%) had a history of kidney stones. For every one-unit increase in ALI score, the risk of having kidney stones decreased by 22.7% (odds ratio = 0.773, 95% CI: 0.675-0.885, P < 0.001). The smooth curve analysis showed a non-linear inverse relationship. The protective effect was stronger when ALI scores were low. Subgroup analyses showed stronger relationships for men aged 60-80, overweight men, former smokers, and men without hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. ROC analysis showed ALI had moderate accuracy in predicting kidney stones (AUC = 0.770). ALI scores were independently linked to a lower risk of kidney stones, especially in men without metabolic diseases. As a simple inflammation and nutrition marker, ALI could help identify people who have a higher risk. However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, a causal relationship between ALI and kidney stone risk cannot be established. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",

Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The clinical decision curve analysis (DCA), alongside the calibration curve and clinical impact curve (CIC) analyses, were used to assess model validity. This study included 174 patients, 64 (36.8%) of whom experienced SMI; logistic regression analysis identified six variables: gender, age, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/A1), uric acid (UA), and triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI). The results identified the TyG-BMI as a predictor of SMI (odds ratios (OR) = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; p = 0.003).

The calibration curve of the model was in high agreement with the ideal curve. The DCA demonstrated that the prediction probability threshold of the model ranged from 12% to 83%, where the patient achieved a significant net clinical benefit. The CIC showed that the model effectively identified high-risk SMI patients when the threshold probability exceeded 0.7. The TyG-BMI is an independent predictor of SMI.

This cohort study prospectively enrolled eligible ACS patients who underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy during hospitalization between June 2015 and January 2020. We defined OSA as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 events per h. EDS was described as having an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ≥10.

    "title": "Identification and Management Strategies for Intracoronary High Thrombus Burden in Patients With STEMI: A Practical Experience and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). STEMI is the most severe type of AMI and is a life-threatening disease. The onset and progress of STEMI are accompanied by thrombosis in coronary arteries, which leads to the occlusion of coronary vessels. The main pathogenesis of STEMI is the presence of unstable atherosclerotic plaques (vulnerable plaques) in the vessel wall of the coronary arteries. The vulnerable plaques may rupture, initiating a cascade of blood coagulation, ultimately leading to the formation and progression of thrombus. Treating STEMI patients with high thrombus burden is a challenging problem in the field of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During the PCI procedure, the thrombus may be squeezed and dislodged, leading to a distal embolism in the infarction-related artery (IRA), resulting in slow blood flow (slow flow) or no blood flow (no reflow), which can enlarge the ischemic necrosis area of myocardial infarction, aggravate myocardial damage, endanger the life of the patient, and lead to PCI failure. Identifying and treating high thrombus burden in the IRA has been a subject of debate and is currently a focal point in research. Clinical strategies such as the use of thrombus aspiration catheters and antiplatelet agents (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, such as tirofiban), as well as the importance of early intervention to prevent complications, such as no reflow and in-stent thrombosis, are highlighted in recent studies. Thrombus aspiration is an effective therapeutic approach for removing intracoronary thrombus, thereby decreasing the incidence of slow flow/no reflow phenomena and enhancing myocardial tissue perfusion, ultimately benefiting from protecting heart function and improving the prognosis of STEMI patients. Notably, deferred stenting benefits STEMI patients with high thrombus burden and hemodynamic instability. Meanwhile, antithrombotic and thrombolytic agents serve as adjuvant therapies alongside PCI. Primary PCI and stenting are reasonable for patients with low intracoronary thrombus burden. The article describes the practical experience of the author and includes a literature review that details the research progress in identifying and managing STEMI patients with intracoronary high thrombus burden, and provides valuable insights into managing patients with high thrombus burden in coronary arteries. Finally, this article serves as a reference for clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial bridging (MB) is a congenital coronary artery anomaly initially regarded as a benign anatomical variant. However, an increasing number of studies have revealed the association between MB and various cardiovascular diseases. The primary pathological mechanisms underlying the relationship include dynamic mechanical compression leading to myocardial ischemia, coronary vasospasm, and the development of proximal atherosclerosis. Advancement of coronary artery imaging technology has enhanced the understanding of the anatomical and hemodynamic features of MB. Although treatment strategies are primarily symptom-driven, morphological and functional evaluation of MB in patients with asymptomatic concomitant cardiovascular diseases is recommended. Pharmacological therapy and management of cardiovascular conditions are the first-line approach. Invasive treatments strategies should be tailored to individual circumstances. This review examines the relationship between MB and other cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), coronary atherosclerosis, and myocardial ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) or myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). It provides an overview of the underlying mechanisms, diagnostic assessments, and treatment strategies. However, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings.",

Independent predictors were identified through multivariable logistic regression, and a nomogram was developed and validated to predict VF risk. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves. Independent predictors of VF included diabetes (OR = 3.676 (1.365-10.668); p = 0.012), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.149 (1.053-1.265); p = 0.002), right coronary artery (RCA) intervention (OR = 3.185 (1.088-9.804); p = 0.037), Gensini score (OR = 1.020 (1.007-1.033); p = 0.003), and absence of beta blockers (OR = 0.168 (0.054-0.472); p = 0.001).

Inflammation is known to alter the course of multiple diseases and can thus, also impact recovery post-treatment and surgical outcomes. Yet, there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and arterial thrombotic potential in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients post-revascularization. Our pilot study attempts to fill this gap by evaluating if the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in PAD patients correlates with the incidence of thrombotic events post-revascularization. Plasma samples were prospectively collected from PAD patients who underwent revascularization from 2021 to 2023 at monthly time points for 6 months from the procedure. Patients were followed for a total of 6 months post-procedure and those who experienced thrombotic events were identified. Nine patients with thrombotic events and 16 with non-thrombotic events along with 5 healthy volunteers were analyzed. Plasma samples were analyzed for the following pro-inflammatory markers: IL-1β (Interleukin-1 beta), IL-6, and TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor - alpha), GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor), IFNγ (Interferon-gamma), IL-8, MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1). The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare bio-inflammatory marker levels between groups. A total of 303 patients were enrolled, of which 59 had thrombotic events. There were no differences between medications or disease burden between groups. Levels of circulating IL-6 and TNF- α were significantly higher in the thrombosis cohort compared to the non-thrombosis cohort (55 vs. 38, p < 0.02) and (159 vs. 110, p < 0.02) respectively. Although there was a trend toward significance for IL-1β between the thrombotic cohort and non-thrombotic cohort, it did not reach statistical significance (18 vs. 11.5, p = NS). There was no difference observed in aspirin's ability to dampen the inflammatory response between the two groups as all patients were on aspirin between the groups evaluated. Pro-inflammatory markers IL-6 and TNF-α are significantly increased in patients, 1 month prior to an arterial thrombotic event, as compared to patients without thrombotic events. These biomarkers could predict impending thrombosis in patients with PAD post-revascularization.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCarotid web can serve as a nidus for clot formation and subsequent thromboembolic stroke. Although treatment historically involved antiplatelet therapy, recent evidence demonstrates notably elevated recurrent stroke rates despite best medical therapy. We examined the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS), which involves placing a coil in the artery, and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), a surgery to remove the clot, for treatment of symptomatic carotid web.MethodsA multi-institutional retrospective registry including adult patients with carotid web with history of ipsilateral acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) treated with either carotid artery stenting or endarterectomy was reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, treatment methodology, and outcomes at follow up were collected.ResultsAmong the 71 included patients (mean age 52.4 years, 44 (62.4%) female), 23 (32.4%) underwent CEA, and 48 (67.6%) underwent CAS. The most common presenting symptoms were hemibody numbness/weakness, aphasia, and gaze deviation. On average, patients had experienced 1.12 ± 0.7 strokes or TIAs before intervention, with a mean delay of 115 ± 224 days between initial stroke/TIA and intervention. The median preintervention modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 2. Perioperatively, one patient (1.41%) experienced stroke and none experienced myocardial infarction. During mean 14.8 (±29.2)-month follow up, one patient experienced asymptomatic recurrent stroke (1.41%). Median mRS at follow up was 1, and carotid artery stenting and endarterectomy demonstrated similar rates of postoperative complication and recurrent stroke rates.ConclusionOur results suggest that endarterectomy and stenting are safe and efficacious for minimizing subsequent stroke risk in patients who have experienced stroke or TIA from carotid webbing, warranting further studies to determine the optimal timing and method of treatment.",

    "abstract": "The comorbidity of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) and depression (DEP) may worsen the prognosis of coronary heart disease surgery. Currently, research on medications and therapeutic mechanisms for MIRI combined with DEP is still insufficient. This study aims to explore the relationship between DEP and MIRI, and the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of Baihe Dihuang Danshen decoction (BDDSD) on DEP combined with MIRI. SD rats were assigned to a final experimental framework of six groups (Sham, MIRI, DEP+MIRI, BDDSD, DEP drug control, MIRI drug control). DEP was induced via 6-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), with BDDSD administered during the final 2 weeks. MIRI was then induced by 30-minute coronary artery ligation and 2-hour reperfusion. DEP severity was assessed using behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference, forced swimming). MIRI outcomes were evaluated via infarct size, histopathology, serum markers (LDH, IL-6, IL-1β), myocardial oxidative stress (MDA, GSH, SOD, Fe²⁺), and NADPH/FSP1/CoQ10 pathway proteins (FSP1, CoQ10, FTL, NOX2, NOX4, COX2). Compared with the MIRI group, DEP significantly exacerbated MIRI, manifested by increased serum IL-6 and IL-1β levels, enlarged infarction area, and aggravated oxidative damage (elevated MDA/Fe²⁺, decreased SOD/GSH). Compared with the DEP+MIRI group, BDDSD intervention relieved DEP of rats, and subsequently reduced infarction area; decreased serum LDH, IL-6, and IL-1β; lowered myocardial MDA and Fe²⁺ while increasing SOD and GSH; upregulated FSP1/CoQ10/FTL; and downregulated NOX2/NOX4/COX2 expression. DEP can aggravate inflammation and oxidative stress, promoting cardiac ferroptosis, thereby exacerbating MIRI. Our results demonstrate that BDDSD alleviates MIRI-DEP comorbidity through a dual mechanism, mitigating depressive symptoms and inhibiting myocardial ferroptosis via modulation of the NADPH/FSP1/CoQ10 pathway. Although the efficacy of BDDSD is encouraging, its dose-effect relationship and long-term safety require further study. BDDSD effectively treats DEP-MIRI comorbidity through its dual mechanism, mitigating DEP and protecting against myocardial ferroptosis. Our study not only offers a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with DEP requiring coronary heart disease surgery but also provides new targets for developing drugs to treat MIRI combined with DEP.",

Five patients developed myocardial infarction and were excluded from the study. Baseline EF was higher in female patients (61.2% ± 3.1% vs. 56.4% ± 2.7%, P < 0.002), in patients aged > 70 years (62.4% ± 2.1% vs. 57.1% ± 2.3%, P < 0.005), and in patients with end-diastolic volume index < 60 mL/m2 (56.1% ± 3.2% vs. 63.4% ± 2.3%, P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major global public health concern. However, the complex interplay between cardiac pathologies and drowning-related deaths remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying sudden aquatic deaths by evaluating the cardiovascular effects of swimming. An extensive dataset was analyzed, including demographic features, death circumstances, detailed autopsy findings, especially macroscopic and microscopic cardiac evaluations, and final causes of death from 222 of the 5267 cases examined over a 10-year period. Cardiac pathologies were identified in 72.9% of cases through macroscopic examinations and in 75.7% of cases through microscopic analyses. The most common macroscopic findings included cardiac hypertrophy and significant coronary artery atherosclerosis. Histopathological examinations revealed frequent cases of myocardial hypertrophy, chronic ischemic changes, and old infarct scars. Acute myocardial infarction was detected in 3.6% of the patients. Despite detailed autopsy and histological analyses in 8.6% of cases, no macroscopic or microscopic pathologies could be identified, suggesting the potential role of molecular cardiac disorders, such as channelopathies. Toxicological analysis revealed that 35.1% of cases involved consumption of active cardiovascular drugs. Sudden cardiac death among swimmers in aquatic environments is strongly associated with pre-existing or latent cardiovascular conditions. Integration of molecular autopsy techniques is recommended to better elucidate unexplained deaths. Further, awareness of the underlying cardiac risk factors for drowning should be increased among forensic experts, clinicians, and public health authorities.",

To determine whether biomarkers of stroke risk for general populations are associated with stroke risk in AF and improve predictive performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >74, Diabetes, prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category) score. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) is a prospective cohort study of 30 239 adults enrolled in 2003 to 2007 and monitored for stroke. Participants with AF not taking anticoagulants and with no prior stroke history were studied. Nine circulating biomarkers were measured in stored baseline samples. Cox models, adjusted for demographics and stroke risk factors estimated associations of each biomarker with incident stroke. Then, models with CHA2DS2-VASc score alone or adding biomarkers were compared using tests of fit (likelihood ratio test and Akaike information criterion) and risk discrimination (continuous net reclassification index, [NRI>0]). Among 2411 participants with AF (median age 69 years, 55% female, 36% Black), 163 (7%) developed first-time ischemic stroke over 13 years. Higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, growth differentiation factor 15, cystatin C, interleukin 6, and lipoprotein (a) were independently associated with higher stroke risk. Biomarkers substantially improved CHA2DS2-VASc model fit (change in Akaike information criterion -13, P < .001) and predictive ability (5-year NRI>0 0.42). Adding only N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and growth differentiation factor 15 yielded the best model fit and a similar NRI>0 compared with all biomarkers. Five biomarkers were associated with stroke risk in AF, and 2 of these improved CHA2DS2-VASc performance. This improved CHA2DS2-VASc-Biomarkers score can allow better selection of patients for anticoagulation to reduce stroke in AF.",

    "abstract": "Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) being the third most occurring cardiovascular disease in the world after Myocardial Infarction and Stroke is very fatal. Being a multi-factorial disease, several risk factors in the terrestrial condition plays crucial part in the disease topography. Once exposed to microgravity, the weightlessness influences several thrombotic parameters, thus making astronauts in-flight to develop higher blood viscosity and increased risk of VTE. An astronaut travelling to the International Space Station developed a blood clot in the left internal Jugular vein, according to a recent case report. A proven way of treating clot development in microgravity does not exist. The information for the current investigation was gathered from reports that were readily available on microgravity and venous thrombosis. Reports on the impact of ground-based analogue and microgravity on the coagulation system demonstrate significant variation in study approaches, goals, and results. Based on the information that is currently available, it has been determined that little is known about the risk factors, pathological regulation, repercussions, and clinical manifestations related to coagulation systems in spaceflight (microgravity). Data, however, indicates that astronauts may be subjected to an elevated coagulation state in the cerebral venous systems when in spaceflight because of an increase in venous pressure and a decrease or reversal of blood flow. High fibrinogen levels, endothelial injury, and to some extent hypercoagulation were also noted. The study recognizes the critical need for additional research to assess the pathogenic processes in the blood that take place during actual spaceflight. This vital knowledge will advise risk estimation, diagnostic possibilities, and countermeasures for thrombosis mitigation in a microgravity setting during future space travel.",

Since then advances in therapy have led to the reduction in the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in this population, whilst complication rates from ICD implantation are still substantial. To determine whether OMT without ICD implantation is not inferior to OMT with ICD implantation with respect to all-cause mortality. The PROFID EHRA trial is an investigator-driven, prospective, parallel-group, randomised, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (PROBE), multi-centre, non-inferiority trial without dedicated investigational medical device (Proof of Strategy Trial) with two groups with 1:1 randomisation. PROFID-EHRA will recruit approximately 3,595 patients with documented history of MI at least three months prior, LVEF ≤35%, on OMT for at least 3 months, and with New York Heart Association class II or III, who will be randomised to OMT or OMT plus ICD, to collect 374 first primary outcome events within a median observation period of around 28 months from about 180 clinical sites in an estimated 13 countries. The primary outcome is time from randomisation to the occurrence of all-cause death. Secondary outcomes include time from randomisation to death from cardiovascular causes, to SCD, to first hospital readmission for cardiovascular causes after date of randomisation, the average length of hospital stay during follow-up, and quality of life trajectories.

REFINE PET is a multicenter, international registry that contains both clinical and imaging data. The PET scans were processed using QPET software (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA), while the CT scans were processed using deep learning (DL) to detect coronary artery calcium (CAC). Patients were followed up for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which include death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and late revascularization (>90 days from PET). The REFINE PET registry currently contains data for 35,588 patients from 14 sites, with additional patient data and sites anticipated. Comprehensive clinical data (including demographics, medical history, and stress test results) were integrated with more than 2200 imaging variables across 42 categories.

The model was trained using data from 9163 admissions in the eICU collaborative research database and externally tested on 12,166 admissions from the medical information Mart for intensive care and 2142 admissions from the Chongqing University central hospital. The performance of the MortiGen was compared with other ten models using multiple evaluation metrics RESULTS: MortiGen demonstrated robust performance in predicting in-hospital mortality using data available at 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, and throughout the entire hospital stay (ranging from 47.2 % to 89.5 % of the data available), with receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.794 to 0.855.

This study aimed to evaluate a dual-inhibition strategy targeting both extracellular and intracellular TLR4 signaling using a combination of cyclic phage display-derived inhibitory peptide 2 (cPIP2) and rosuvastatin (RSV), a clinically approved anti-inflammatory agent. In a rat AMI model, cPIP2 and RSV were administered alone or a combination of both. Pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis showed that the combined treatment significantly improved cardiac function, including increased cardiac output, stroke volume, and ejection fraction. Histological staining and RNA sequencing revealed that the dual treatment reduced fibrosis, as evidenced by decreased expression of TLR4, CD68, and IL-6 while promoting angiogenesis through upregulation of CD31. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed restoration of mitochondrial genes and inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. These results demonstrate that concurrent extracellular and intracellular inhibition of TLR4 signaling via cPIP2 and RSV leads to robust cardiac protection and functional recovery post-AMI. This dual-targeted approach represents a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing pathological remodeling and enhancing myocardial repair after ischemic injury.",

Despite the increasing adoption of distal transradial access by interventionalists, there is a lack of data addressing gender-specific differences. This study aimed to assess those differences in routine coronary procedures via distal transradial access. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a large, real-world sample of 6871 consecutive all-comers who underwent coronary procedures via distal transradial access using data from the DISTRACTION registry. The mean patient ages were 63.8 ± 15.7 years, 63.5 ± 17.7, and 64.4 ± 11.1 years for total, male, and female groups, respectively; 65% of the patients were male. In the female group, there was statistically significant predominance of hypertension (82.2% vs 74%), diabetes (46.8% vs 37%), obesity (29.3% vs 22.2%), severe mitral valve disease (3.1% vs 1.1%), coronary angiography-only (48.7% vs 36%), and access-site crossovers (3.1% vs 1.5%). In the male group, there were more rates of former or current smoking (54.2% vs 40.8%), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (29.8% vs 19.7%), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (4.5% vs 1.9%), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (24.2% vs 18.5%), PCI (66.1% vs 52.5%), left main PCI (2.6% vs 1.7%), redo right distal transradial access (15.3% vs 9.9%), and 7F sheath size (2.6% vs 0.9%). No major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events directly related to distal transradial access, no hand/thumb dysfunction or ischemia after any procedure, and no relevant access-site-related bleeding were recorded. The adoption of distal transradial access by proficient operators as the default approach for routine coronary procedures appears to be safe and feasible in both male and female patients, with very low rates of access site crossovers and complications.",

The pooled data of the low-dose group was then compared with the control, high-dose, and epsilon aminocaproic acid groups. The boundary between the lowand high-dose groups was a bolus of 30 mg/kg followed by 16 mg/kg/hour. The meta-analysis included 81 studies. The low-dose tranexamic acid regimen was associated with a decreased incidence of reoperation (risk ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.69; high quality of evidence), perioperative myocardial infarction (risk ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.95; high quality of evidence), the amount of postoperative bleeding in 24 hours, and the need for transfusion of packed red cells compared to control, without increasing the rates of mortality, venous thromboembolism, or stroke. Compared with the high-dose group, the low-dose group had a lower incidence of seizures and stroke. The low-dose of tranexamic acid group also showed significantly reduced postoperative bleeding; however, the cost of an increased risk of seizure events was higher in the low-dose group than in the epsilon aminocaproic acid group.

Porcine coronary bypass models were established using off-pump (OPCAB) and on-pump beating-heart surgical approaches. Through a triple randomization design, test devices and predicate counterparts were deployed in left/right coronary arteries. Equivalence was determined at postoperative day 7 through tripartite analysis: 1) sequential laboratory measurements (preoperative to 7-day follow-up), 2) histopathological evaluation of vascular specimens, and 3) angiographic assessment. Extreme-sized device validation employed rabbit carotid arteries (small-caliber vascular bed) and abdominal aortae (large-caliber model), with equivalence criteria encompassing hemodynamic stability (flow velocity, trans-device pressure differentials) and microarchitectural preservation (endothelial integrity, internal elastic lamina continuity). In the conventional device cohort (12 target vessels), no perioperative type 5 myocardial infarction occurred. Postoperative CTA confirmed patent lumens and unobstructed distal flow in all vessels. Cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB, myoglobin) showed no significant differences at preoperative, 4h, 8h, 24h, 72h, or 7-day timepoints (P ≥ 0.05).

Functional parity between TICS and predicate devices was established in both porcine and lagomorph models, with observed endothelial alterations demonstrating transient characteristics limited to the acute perioperative window.",

Prompt revascularisation is crucial once a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is established. It is well-known that improved coronary flow and perfusion result in better long-term outcomes. In our study, we aimed to compare the effects of balloon angioplasty with prolonged and brief balloon inflation on coronary flow in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in STEMI patients. We included 62 patients who presented to our clinic diagnosed with STEMI and underwent primary PCI in our study. Pre-dilation was performed briefly, under 30 seconds (s), in 31 patients, while prolonged balloon dilation exceeding 30 s was conducted in the remaining 31 patients. ST-segment resolutions, laboratory parameters, troponin monitoring, and troponin peak times were collected for both groups before and after the procedure. After revascularisation of the responsible vessel, coronary flow parameters like thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score, TIMI frame count (TIMIfc), and myocardial blush grade (MBG) were evaluated. Participants in both groups were similar in characteristics aside from the investigated parameters (p >0.05). The troponin peak occurred earlier in those with prolonged balloon inflation times. Electrocardiography (ECG) improvement percentages at 1, 3, and 6 hours were higher in the prolonged balloon group (78.71±21, 92.26±1, 96.77±1) compared to the brief balloon group (60.97±2, 81.94±1, 92.90±1) (p <0.05). Logistic regression showed that increasing age negatively affected TIMI flow grade and myocardial blush grade, while prolonged balloon times had a positive impact (p <0.05). The current study demonstrated that prolonged balloon pre-dilation yielded superior outcomes compared to brief balloon pre-dilation in primary PCI performed on STEMI patients. These outcomes included enhanced TIMI, TIMIfc, and MBG parameters, along with faster and improved ST-segment resolution, allowing for a more rapid attainment of the troponin peak value. If similar findings are demonstrated in larger studies, standardising the balloon duration could be beneficial in primary PCI of STEMI patients. Thus, improved coronary flow would be associated with better long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Using real-world data, the current study compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between two regulated combined oral hormonal products that are currently available to women in the USA: body-identical oral 17β-estradiol/micronized progesterone (E2/P4) and conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA). Women aged ≥40 years treated with E2/P4 or CEE/MPA were selected from a US claims database (April 2019-June 2021). The E2/P4 or CEE/MPA cohorts were defined based on the first dispensation of E2/P4 or CEE/MPA (index) as prescribed in the real world. Women with pre-index MACE hospitalization were excluded. Confounding was controlled via inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighting. MACE risk was compared between the IPT-weighted cohorts using Cox and Poisson/negative binomial regression models. The E2/P4 and CEE/MPA cohorts included 6520 and 29,426 women respectively (mean follow-up 1.2 and 1.4 years). In the IPT-weighted analyses, MACE rates were 23.5 versus 85.4 per 10,000 women-years among women treated with E2/P4 and CEE/MPA (IPT-weighted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17 - 0.45; IPT-weighted hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.27 - 0.50). Real-world evidence suggests that the MACE risk is significantly lower among women treated with E2/P4 compared to CEE/MPA. This study examined myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure events that were serious enough to require hospitalization (collectively referred to as major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]) among women aged 40 years and older who started hormone therapy for menopause. The study compared the occurrence of MACE between women taking two different types of oral hormone therapy. The specific combined oral menopause hormone therapies compared in the current study were body-identical oral 17β-estradiol/micronized progesterone (E2/P4) and conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA).The study used real-world data from women who began menopause hormone therapy treatment between April 2019 and June 2021 who were not hospitalized for MACE before the start of treatment. The study included 6520 women treated with E2/P4 and 29,426 women treated with CEE/MPA. To make a fair comparison, statistical analysis techniques were used to account for differences between the two groups such as age and health history.The results showed that for every 10,000 women taking E2/P4 over a period of 1 year, 24 women had MACE hospitalization. In contrast, for every 10,000 comparable women taking CEE/MPA over a period of 1 year, 85 women had MACE hospitalization. The study results suggest that the risk of MACE hospitalization is lower among women treated with E2/P4 than those treated with CEE/MPA.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To verify the accuracy of clinically used cardiac MRI T1 mapping sequences for measuring extracellular volume fraction (ECV) throughout the spectrum of pathologic values using an independent reference standard. Materials and Methods Acute myocardial ischemia was induced in six pigs using endovascular balloon occlusion in the left anterior descending artery between October 2018 and November 2018. After 7 days of reperfusion, ECV was measured in vivo using four sequences: three modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) and one saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA) sequences. ECV was also measured using ex vivo SPECT following injection of technetium 99m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. ECV was calculated for corresponding regions of interest of necrosis on cardiac MR and SPECT images and in myocardium remote from injury. Mixed model analysis was used to test for correlation, while the paired t test was used to test for differences in T1 and ECV. Results ECV measurements with all T1 mapping sequences showed high correlation to the reference standard (r2 range, 0.71-0.99). Measurements with MOLLI 5(3)3 and MOLLI 5s(3s)3s overestimated ECV in the infarct region compared with the reference standard (bias ± 2 SDs: 8.2% ± 8.5 and 4.9% ± 8.7; P = .005 and P = .04, respectively). All sequences showed overestimation of ECV in the remote region (range of bias, 3%-14% points, all MOLLI P values ≤ .001, SASHA P = .04). Conclusion This study verified the accuracy of clinically used T1 mapping sequences in measuring ECV in absolute values over a spectrum of pathologic values, using an independent radioisotope-based three-dimensionally acquired reference standard.

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), a prevalent critical cardiovascular disease (CVD), poses a severe threat to patients' lives. Despite the availability of pharmacological, interventional, and surgical treatments in clinical practice, these conventional therapies encounter the bottleneck of difficulty in repairing and reconstructing damaged myocardial tissue. Additionally, novel cardiac repair approaches based on stem cell and cardiomyocyte injections are restricted by the harsh microenvironment of infarcted areas. However, biomaterial hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for MI treatment due to their strong mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, high water absorption capacity, and excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These features enable them to enhance the microenvironment, promote myocardial regeneration, and restore myocardial function. This article delves into the therapeutic effects of sodium alginate (SA) and its composite hydrogel materials in repairing and regenerating myocardial injuries caused by MI. Furthermore, it offers insights into the future research directions of SA and its composite hydrogel materials. It also explores their potential applications in the field of CVDs. Impact Statement This review article highlights the significance and potential impact of sodium alginate (SA)-based hydrogels in myocardial infarction (MI) treatment. It effectively communicates the importance of the research, the gap in the current treatments for MI, and how the reviewed SA hydrogels offer a promising solution with their unique properties. It also clearly states the intended contribution to the field and the potential benefits for researchers and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are at increased risk of incomplete revascularization and adverse outcomes. Simple biomarkers to predict residual disease burden and prognosis are clinically valuable. The hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score reflects inflammation and nutritional status. This study evaluated the association of the HALP score with the residual Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (rSS) and 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM patients with NSTEMI. This retrospective study included 210 diabetic patients. Participants were stratified into three groups based on rSS (0, 1-8, > 8). HALP scores were calculated from admission laboratory values, and outcomes were followed for 12 months. Associations between HALP and rSS were assessed using Spearman correlation and multivariable regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a HALP cut-off value for predicting high rSS. The prognostic value for MACE was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. HALP scores were significantly lower in patients with rSS > 8 (P < 0.001) and were negatively associated with rSS (β = -0.344, P < 0.001). The optimal HALP score cut-off for predicting rSS > 8 was 2.96, with 78% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Patients with HALP ≤ 2.96 had a higher prevalence of rSS > 8 (43.7% vs. 6.5%) and experienced more MACE over 12 months (29.6% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.005). In Cox analysis, a low HALP score (≤ 2.96) was an independent predictor of MACE, along with age and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (hazard ratio = 1.916, P = 0.045). Lower HALP scores are associated with higher residual disease burden and worse outcomes. The HALP score may serve as a practical tool for risk stratification in patients with diabetic NSTEMI.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) poses a substantial risk to human health, leading to serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular incidents, such as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and ischemic shock. The treatment and control of AS are challenging because of its complex pathogenesis and multiple risk factors. Notably, changes in the estrogen levels and aging are associated with the formation and progression of AS because of their involvement in lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Emerging evidence suggests that estrogen modulates vascular senescence pathways, whereas aging exacerbates endothelial dysfunction induced by estrogen deficiency, thereby establishing a bidirectional pathogenic loop. However, the precise interplay between estrogen and aging in AS pathogenesis remains uncertain, particularly regarding whether their effects are synergistic or sequential, and how sex-specific aging trajectories influence this relationship. In this review, In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay among estrogen, aging, and AS, thereby laying the foundation for developing novel therapeutic approaches to AS management. We propose the integration of targeted aging interventions, such as the elimination of senescent cells or the inhibition of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), with refined estrogen replacement strategies that account for therapeutic timing, receptor subtype specificity, and aging-related vascular microenvironment changes. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to delineate estrogen-aging interactions during the menopausal transition, develop tissue-selective estrogen analogs, and design combinatorial therapies targeting hormonal deficits and cellular senescence. This dual-pathway strategy may overcome limitations of conventional estrogen replacement therapies while addressing the root causes of age-exacerbated AS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Renal dysfunction is the most common risk factor for patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this research was to evaluate the prognosis and mid-term outcomes in CABG patients with mild renal dysfunction. Patients undergoing isolated CABG from July 2020 to December 2022 in Nanjing First Hospital were selected into this cohort study and divided into normal renal function group (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to CKD G1) and mild renal dysfunction group (eGFR: 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to CKD G2). Propensity score matching was used to balance the differences. The primary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause mortality in follow-up, while the secondary outcomes were perioperative mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) including death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and revascularization. Totally 1,097 patients were enrolled in this study and 416 (33.3%) had mild renal dysfunction. A total of 379 pairs were included to the analysis after propensity score matching. Compared with the normal renal function, patients with mild renal dysfunction had more AKI after CABG (26.1% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.015), however, the perioperative mortality (1.3% vs. 1.3%, p = 1.00) was not significantly different. At 3-year follow-up, there were also no significant differences in all-cause mortality (6.3% vs. 4.8%, log-rank p = 0.33, HR 1.38, 95%CI: 0.721-2.652) and MACCE rates (10.2% vs. 7.6%, log-rank p = 0.19, HR 1.42, 95%CI: 0.836-2.414). For patients undergoing CABG, preoperative renal dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI.

Emerging evidence suggests that patients with extremely high CAC (≥1000) represent a distinct high-risk group. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) in patients with very high CAC. Consecutive patients who had a clinically indicated positron emission tomography were enrolled and followed prospectively for incident outcomes (all-cause death and myocardial infarction). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association between MFR and incident events (composite of all-cause death and myocardial infarction) among those with CAC ≥400. The study population consisted of 3091 patients; mean (SD) age 69.6 (10.1) years, 36.8% female, 64.5% White, 46.0% with a CAC score of 400 to 999, and 54.0% with a CAC score of ≥1000. The median (interquartile range) MFR was 1.9 (1.45-2.35). Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 1.36 (0.45-2.50) years, there were 278 incident events (81 myocardial infarctions and 217 deaths). In adjusted analyses, an MFR ≥2 was inversely associated with a lower risk of incident events; hazard ratio, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.38-1.12) for a CAC score of 400 to 999 and hazard ratio, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.28-0.69) for a CAC score of ≥ 1000. There was no significant interaction between MFR and CAC score; P=0.53. Among patients with CAC ≥400, positron emission tomography-derived MFR ≥2 is inversely associated with a lower risk of all-cause death and myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most frequent non-inherited risks to health that contributes to cardiovascular disease. Whereas the effects of reducing blood pressure are clear-cut, it is debatable what the optimal blood pressure level should be maintained. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare intensive blood pressure control with standard blood pressure control regarding cardiovascular outcomes, specifically focusing on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We searched electronic databases comprehensively (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) from inception up to March 2025 to find randomized controlled trials comparing intensive control of systolic blood pressure with standard control. The primary outcome was MACE, a composite measure including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and adverse events. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects to measure risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our analysis incorporated 37,249 subjects from 12 randomized controlled trials. Intensive blood pressure control significantly decreased the odds of MACE (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.88) compared to standard management. Notable reductions were also observed in cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90), stroke (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68-0.90), and heart failure (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.88). However, intensive management was associated with higher risks of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte imbalance, and acute kidney injury. Overall, our results indicate that achieving lower blood pressure targets yields significant cardiovascular benefits, particularly in reducing MACE, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and heart failure. However, these advantages must be weighed against the increased risk of adverse events. Treatment decisions should be individualized based on patient characteristics, risk factors, and preferences. Additionally, moderate heterogeneity was noted across studies, and the risk of bias was assessed, revealing good methodological quality overall.",

It often presents with spontaneous bleeding and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and is commonly associated with autoimmune disorders, malignancy, or idiopathic causes. Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm that has occasionally been linked with paraneoplastic phenomena, including AHA. An elderly patient presented following a fall with normal imaging but was noted to have a markedly prolonged aPTT (78-104 seconds), normal prothrombin time (PT), and an isolated severe factor VIII deficiency (<0.01 IU/mL). A Bethesda assay confirmed high-titer factor VIII inhibitors, with a measured level of 9 Bethesda units (BU). No underlying autoimmune disease or malignancy was identified initially; however, persistent neutrophilia over several years raised suspicion of undiagnosed CNL. The patient subsequently developed retroperitoneal haemorrhage with a significant haemoglobin drop, requiring transfusion. Later, the patient suffered an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and, after a multidisciplinary discussion, was transitioned to palliative care. Sadly, the patient passed away eight days post-admission. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of AHA, particularly when associated with occult or undiagnosed haematological malignancies like CNL.

The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of these parameters as indicators of reperfusion syndrome and disease risk. This research was carried out in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (CEP) of the Karaganda Pluridisciplinary Hospital during the years 2021-2022. Based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 95 patients with STEMI were selected to determine total antioxidant capacity. In addition, the relationship between fundamental characteristics of oxidation state (OSA) and myocadiac ischemia and effect damage was analyzed, including part of the left bus evaluated by echocardiography. The initial findings indicate that oxidative stress assessment (OSA) does not vary significantly across the different stages of acute MI. The indicators of Vitamin C Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (AQI) do not show statistically significant differences between the three types of antioxidants, the 3 months of infarction. Second, significant direct correlation between fast-acting (Q1), slow-acting (Q2), and full-load (QT) antioxidant indicators was found. The application of the express method to determine antioxidant levels through the e-BQC apparatus of patients with STEMI continues to have doubts in the corrective phase of the oxidation process. More research and funding are needed to explore alternative approaches or additional markers to improve the accuracy and availability of oxidative stress assessments in the treatment of MI.",

    "abstract": "The document comprehensively reviews proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), focusing on their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, toxicity, and clinical efficacy. PPIs irreversibly inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme in gastric parietal cells, effectively reducing gastric acid secretion. These drugs are widely prescribed for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, eradication of Helicobacter pylori and as a prevention against bleeding from gastrointestinal tract. The review article highlights significant drug interactions associated with PPIs. Omeprazole, for instance, can interfere with the metabolism of clopidogrel, reducing its antiplatelet efficacy, which may have clinical implications. The article also discusses other drug interactions, including anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as the side effects associated with taking PPIs. Long-term use of PPIs is linked to plenty of adverse effects, such as vitamin B12 and calcium deficiencies, which can lead to bone fractures. An increased risk of infections, including Clostridium difficile and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), is also noted. Cardiovascular risks, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are observed in some patients on high-dose or prolonged PPI therapy. In rare cases, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are reported. Additionally, the document examines the potential role of PPIs in exacerbating certain cancers, such as gastric adenocarcinoma, and in influencing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. PPIs are proven effective in treating GERD and preventing complications from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly in reducing the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers. The document stresses the importance of understanding drug interactions and the need for individualized treatment to minimize adverse effects. Ongoing research into PPIs' long-term safety and efficacy remains essential, particularly given their widespread use in clinical practice.",

The main results of meta-analysis were as follows: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of microRNA-1 for the diagnosis of AMI were 78% (95% CI: 0.69-0.85) and 85% (95% CI: 0.76-0.91), respectively, the positive likelihood ratio was 5.1 (95%CI: 3.0-8.6), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.17-0.38), the diagnostic odds ratio was 20 (95% CI: 9-47), and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 88% (95% CI: 0.85-0.91). Plasma microRNA-1 has high sensitivity and specificity for early AMI, and has certain diagnostic value, which can help distinguish AMI from patients with other systemic diseases, and can be combined with other biomarkers to diagnose AMI.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify senescence-related biomarkers for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) prognosis. RNA expression data for STEMI samples and controls were obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, and cellular senescence genes were acquired from CellAge database. Differential and overlap analyses were used to identify differentially expressed cellular senescence-related genes (DE-SRGs) in STEMI samples. Differentially expressed cellular senescence-related genes were further analyzed by plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and machine learning algorithms. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed on each biomarker. Immune-related analyses, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) construction, and target drug prediction were performed on biomarkers. This study identified 7 DE-SRGs for STEMI prognosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results showed enriched pathways, including ribosomes, autophagy, allograft rejection, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Furthermore, T cells, CD4 memory resting T cells, gamma delta, monocytes, and neutrophils represented significantly different proportions between STEMI samples and controls. In addition, CEBPB was positively correlated with monocytes and neutrophils but negatively correlated with T-cell CD8. A ceRNA network was established, and 8 FDA-approved drugs were predicted. This study identified 7 cellular senescence-related biomarkers, which could lay a foundation for further study of the relationship between STEMI and cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the mid-term outcomes of patients admitted for a diabetic foot attack (DFA). It is a retrospective observational study including a population of patients admitted for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) into a specialized multidisciplinary diabetic foot service. Based on the type of hospital admission (emergency or elective), patients were divided into two groups: those with DFA and those without DFA (chronic diabetic foot, CDF). The DFA was considered in case of ischemia (acute or chronic), infection and Charcot foot requiring urgent hospitalization. Once discharged, patients were regularly followed as outpatients with the following six-month outcomes: healing; major amputation; mortality; hospital readmission; non-fatal major adverse limb and cardiovascular events (MALCE) including nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and limb ischemia requiring revascularization. Overall, 141 patients were included. The mean age was 70 ± 12 years, most patients were male (76.6%) and had type 2 diabetes (93.6%) with a mean duration of 22 ± 13 years; 81 (57.4%) patients presented DFA while 60 (42.6%) presented CDF. No cases of admitted Charcot foot were recorded. The DFA group reported 81.5% cases of severe/moderate infections, while the CDF group presented 50% of mild infections. The DFA group reported higher HbA1c values (67 ± 22 vs 56 ± 14 mmol/mol, p = 0.0008) and more cases of first assessment for DFUs (59.3 vs 13.3%, p < 0.0001) when compared to the CDF group. The six-month follow-up outcomes for DFA and CDF were: healing (65.4 vs 60.0%, p = 0.3); major amputation (4.9 vs 1.7%, p = 0.2); mortality (8.6 vs 11.7%, p = 0.5); hospital readmission (27.2 vs 26.7%, p = 0.8); non-fatal MALCE (9.9 vs 23.3%, p = 0.1). Six-month outcomes did not show significant differences between the DFA and CDF groups in terms of healing, major amputation, mortality, readmission, and non-fatal MALCE. Adequate management of DFA seems to ensure favourable mid-term outcomes, even if compared to patients with CDF.",

Our study aimed to investigate the knowledge of smoking tobacco, smoking behaviour, nicotine use, willingness to quit smoking, and level of stress, anxiety, and depression among current and former smokers in the Klang Valley of Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted online from March 2023 to January 2024, using a structured, validated questionnaire. Individuals with a history of active or previous smoking and living in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia were included using a convenience sampling technique. The study instrument consisted of six sections with 56 questions using varying response types, to collect the data. Out of 395 respondents, the majority were male (n = 326; 82.5%), between the ages of 41 and 50 (n = 107; 27.1%). Around 183 (46.3%) had secondary-level education, 50% had an income below RM2000 (n = 210), and 57.2% lived with family members. The majority of the respondents (n = 327; 82.8%) knew or believed that smoking tobacco causes serious illness and were aware that smoking tobacco causes heart attack (n = 311; 78.7%), and lung cancer (n = 310; 78.4%). Despite knowing the consequences of smoking, the majority currently smoked (n = 273; 86.1%) and found it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it is forbidden (n = 153; 38.7%). More than three-fourths are lived with smokers (n = 301; 76.2%), and half of them (n = 208; 52.7%) had attempted to quit smoking in the past 12 months but failed to continue. Women who smoke were about 4.5 times (AOR 4.48, 95%CI 2.06-9.76) more likely to attempt to quit, and individuals who reported seeing health warnings were 5.6 times more likely to make quit attempts. The participants exhibited varying levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, with 22.3% (n = 88) experiencing severe stress, 37.7% (n = 149) extreme anxiety, and 32.9% (n = 130) moderate depression. Smoking tobacco was common among the respondents, despite their awareness of the consequences. The inability to sustain quitting smoking was also prevalent and needs to be addressed promptly to help them successfully quit. Quitting smoking will enhance their physical, social, and psychosocial well-being and their overall health-related quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH) after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We aimed to integrate a coronary angiography-derived index of microcirculatory resistance (caIMR) with clinical features in a nomogram model for predicting IMH in patients with STEMI following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A retrospective study included 309 STEMI patients admitted at Xuzhou Medical University for primary PCI from 2022 to 2023 in training and validation cohorts. Their caIMR was calculated from coronary angiography images and IMH was assessed by cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR). A nomogram was constructed through logistic regression analyses. Predictive accuracy, calibration, and clinical usefulness were validated by an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA), respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. A total of 247 patients were assigned to the training cohort and 62 to the validation cohort randomly. A nomogram was established using two independent predictors of IMH derived from multivariable analysis: caIMR and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The AUC for the nomogram was 0.844 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.793-0.896) in the training cohort and 0.834 (95% CI: 0.724-0.944) in the validation cohort. The predicted and actual estimates were significantly correlated in both cohorts, indicating good calibration of the nomogram. The nomogram was clinically useful for the prediction of IMH, within a 10-88% and 10-74% threshold probability in the training and validation cohorts respectively, exhibited by DCA. Furthermore, the nomogram showed superior discriminative ability for MACE prediction compared to CMR-confirmed IMH (AUC 0.726 vs. 0.584, P < 0.001). This novel caIMR-based nomogram resulted in high accuracy of prediction for IMH and MACE in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. It may become a convenient tool to predict IMH immediately after the PCI procedure, and help with prognostic judgment and early clinical intervention.",

    "title": "PET Study of S1PR1 Expression in Rodent Model of Myocardial Infarction.",
    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator influencing numerous physiological processes. S1PR1 is the predominant isoform of the S1P receptor in cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells. S1PR1 plays a critical role in preventing adverse cardiac remodeling. The importance of S1PR1 in cardiac physiology has led to the development of novel treatments for MI, including S1PR1 gene delivery strategies aimed at preventing heart failure. Monitoring the dynamic changes of S1PR1 post-MI is clinically significant for assessing cardiac remodeling. This study validated the ability of specific S1PR1 PET radiotracer [18F]FS1P1 to track changes in this signaling pathway, thereby providing a non-invasive diagnostic tool to quantify S1PR1 expression for investigating MI in vivo. We characterized the S1PR1 radiotracer [18F]FS1P1 in an echo-guided mouse model of MI. [18F]FDG PET was used to delineate the infarct area. Masson trichrome staining was used to identify cardiac fibrosis. Immunofluorescence (IF) experiment was conducted to demonstrate changes in S1PR1 expression after MI. Autoradiography was performed to evaluate the distribution of [18F]FS1P1 in MI heart tissues. MI (n = 4) and sham (n = 4) mice were scanned with [18F]FS1P1 PET at 2 days and 2 weeks post-MI, radioactivity uptake in the myocardium was calculated as the percentage of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g). The uptake of [18F]FS1P1 was significantly decreased by 31.8% in the infarct region at 2 days post-MI compared to the sham group (1.3 ± 0.3 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3), and decreased by 37.6% at 2 weeks post-MI (1.2 ± 0.5). Additionally, [18F]FS1P1 signal decreased by 20.8% in the non-infarct remote area at 2 weeks post-MI compared with the sham control (1.6 ± 0.4 vs. 2.0 ± 0.2). Autoradiography study confirmed the trend of decreased [18F]FS1P1 uptake in the MI tissues. IF studies confirmed that the change in the [18F]FS1P1 PET signal corresponded with the change in S1PR1 expression. This study demonstrated the downregulation of S1PR1 expression following MI and validated the use of [18F]FS1P1 PET imaging as an effective tool for detecting changes in S1PR1 expression post-MI.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a key contributor to the pathophysiology of various chronic diseases, including cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, chronic wounds, and gastrointestinal conditions, many of which rank among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, according to the WHO. The prevalence of chronic inflammation-related diseases is projected to rise steadily over the next 30 years, with an estimated three out of five individuals dying daily as a result of such conditions. Consequently, there is a growing demand for the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory agents. Cyclooxygenases play a pivotal role in inflammatory processes, being responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and primarily associated with \"housekeeping\" physiological functions, whereas COX-2 is an inducible isoform involved in inflammatory responses. Due to its role in inflammation and relatively favorable gastric safety profile compared to traditional NSAIDs, COX-2 has emerged as a significant therapeutic target for inflammation-related disorders. However, the increased risk of stroke and heart attack associated with COX-2 inhibitors has led to the withdrawal of several approved COX-2-targeting drugs from the market. Consequently, the development of new COX-2 inhibitors with potent efficacy and minimal cardiovascular side effects is of critical importance. This review explores a range of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles as potential anti-inflammatory agents, emphasizing their COX-2 inhibitory activity, structure-activity relationships, and interactions within the COX-2 active site, as reported in recent studies. The article covers research findings published from 2019 through the first quarter of 2025.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction is a significant global health issue, with a high mortality rate. Early intervention, specifically coronary angiography, has been shown to improve patient outcomes significantly. Recent technological advances have introduced novel therapeutic interventions like Supersaturated Oxygen (SSO2) Therapy, which promises enhanced recovery post-ischemia. To evaluate the efficacy and potential benefits of SSO2 therapy in improving post-ischemic outcomes, including left ventricular function, myocardial scarring, and overall cardiac morphology. This review synthesizes findings from early clinical trials and pre-clinical animal studies focusing on the application of SSO2. The therapy involves delivering oxygen at ten times the normal level directly to the infarcted artery to facilitate high oxygen diffusion before restoring downstream flow. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that SSO2 therapy enhances Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), increases mean arterial PaO2, reduces myocardial apoptosis, and decreases myocardial scarring and infarct sizes. Clinical trials, including the Acute Myocardial Infarction with Hyperoxemic Therapy (AMIHOT I and AMIHOT II), have shown improvements in echocardiographic regional wall motion and have helped in preventing myocardial dilatation and remodeling. SSO2 therapy presents a promising advance in the treatment of myocardial infarction. While early results are favorable, indicating significant improvements in cardiac function and tissue preservation, long-term follow-up studies are necessary to determine the impact on mortality rates, recurrence of ischemic events, and healthcare resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia is a frequent and serious complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), leading to higher mortality. Early prediction is critical for timely intervention, but existing methods are limited by poor accuracy and low clinical applicability. We developed a novel hybrid model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN), Transformer, and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for arrhythmia prediction in AMI patients. A two-stage feature selection using XGBoost and SHAP identified the top 10 clinical predictors from 45 variables. The model was trained and validated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation on a retrospective cohort of 2,084 patients. Performance was compared with traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines using accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-score, MCC, and G-Mean. The CNN-Transformer-WOA model achieved an accuracy of 92.4%, an AUC-ROC of 0.96, and an F1-score of 0.91, outperforming all baseline models (p < 0.01). Ablation studies showed that combining CNN and Transformer improved predictive power and that WOA-based hyperparameter tuning further enhanced robustness. The model maintained stable performance across subgroups and demonstrated low inference latency (<8 ms per case). SHAP-based analysis provided interpretable clinical insights. This study presents an accurate, interpretable, and robust deep learning solution for arrhythmia prediction in AMI patients. The framework enables real-time, evidence-based risk stratification, and is suitable for integration into clinical decision support systems, offering practical value for improving patient care in real-world hospital environments.

    "abstract": "The glucose-potassium ratio (GPR) index has been recognized as an early prognostic marker for central nervous system injuries, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Nevertheless, its prognostic significance in critically ill patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has not been thoroughly examined. This study sought to explore the relationship between the GPR index and clinical outcomes in this group of patients. This retrospective cohort study employed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database to identify critically ill patients with AMI who necessitated admission to the ICU. The patients were categorized into quartiles according to their GPR index levels. The primary outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality at 1 year and at 180 days. To compare survival rates across the four groups, Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized. Additionally, Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were performed to investigate the association between the GPR index and clinical outcomes. The study comprised a total of 3811 patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), of which 70.40% were male. Within this cohort, 999 patients, representing 26.21%, succumbed within one year. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a statistically significant elevation in mortality risk among patients exhibiting increased GPR indices (log-rank P < 0.001). Furthermore, restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a non-linear escalation in the risk of all-cause mortality corresponding to rising GPR indices (P for nonlinearity < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that individuals in the highest quartile of GPR indices faced a markedly increased risk of 1-year all-cause mortality when compared to those in the lowest quartile [HR 1.70; 95% CI (1.40-2.07); P < 0.001]. Consistent patterns were noted in the assessment of 180-day all-cause mortality. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are critically ill, an elevated GPR index correlates with a heightened risk of all-cause mortality at both 1 year and 180 days. These results indicate that the GPR index could be an important instrument for the identification of high-risk individuals with AMI.",

Mortality in RA is influenced by an increased risk of cardiovascular events by up to 48% (RR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.62), with a higher standardized mortality rate (SMR) due to cardiovascular causes compared to the general population. Our main objective was to examine the effect of clinical and serological variables on the risk of major cardiovascular events (MCE) in a cohort of RA patients. This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients more tha 18 years old and active follow-up in the RA care models of Hospital Universitario Clínica San Rafael and Clínica Nogales were included. Patients with prior major cardiovascular events or polyautoimmunity syndromes before the RA diagnosis were excluded. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the probability of remaining free of MCEs, along with Cox proportional hazards analysis and structural equation modeling using a PATH analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. A total of 406 patients were included, 342 (84%) of whom were women, with a mean age of 44.8±13.1 years and a disease duration of 13±13.4 months. The average DAS28 activity score was 2.5±1.78, with 48.7% having active disease (DAS28>2.6). Nineteen patients experienced MCEs, resulting in a cumulative incidence (CI) of 4.68% (4.4% myocardial infarction and 1.4% stroke). The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (23.7%) and smoking (24.8%). Bivariate analysis showed that heart failure (RR=1.58, 95% CI 1.12-2.23, p=0.01), and hypertension (RR=2.36, 95% CI 1.22-4.60, p<0.01) were significantly associated with MCEs. The probability of MCE-free survival at six months post-diagnosis was 50%. In the Cox model, only hypertension and age at diagnosis were significantly associated with MCE outcomes. In the PATH analysis, dyslipidemia was significantly associated with myocardial infarction without a mediating effect from corticosteroids (coef=1.83, p<0.001). Traditional risk factors increase the risk of MCEs in RA patients. Additionally, dyslipidemia acts as an independent risk factor without mediation by other variables, making it a therapeutic target for preventing these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Isolated infra-popliteal occlusive disease poses significant clinical challenges due to limited durable treatment options and poor limb salvage and survival rates. While endovascular therapy (ET) has gained prominence for its minimally invasive approach, popliteal-distal bypass (PDB) provides an effective open approach that minimizes dissection and length of bypass required. This study aims to compare real-world outcomes of PDB versus infra-popliteal ET for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) secondary to isolated infra-popliteal occlusive disease. Patients who underwent a PDB or isolated infra-popliteal ET for CLTI between 2010 and 2024 were identified in the Vascular Quality Initiative. PDB was defined as a bypass using single-segment GSV originating from an above-knee or below-knee popliteal artery inflow; patients with a concomitant more proximal PVI or bypass were excluded. Infra-popliteal ET was defined as transluminal balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, and/or stenting of a tibial artery; patients with a concomitant bypass or femoro-popliteal intervention were excluded. Three-to-one nearest-neighbor propensity score matching without replacement was performed to ensure balance of covariates between the two comparison groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analysis were used to estimate long-term event rates and evaluate the association of type of intervention with the long-term outcomes of survival, amputation-free survival, primary patency, and major adverse limb events (MALE) defined as the composite outcome of amputation and/or re-intervention. 3,619 patients who underwent PDB were matched to 10,857 patients who underwent isolated infra-popliteal ET. All baseline characteristics and demographics were balanced after propensity score matching. The utilization of PDB for isolated infra-popliteal occlusive disease decreased from 25% to 5% between 2010-2023, while that of infra-popliteal ET increased from 75% to 95%. PDB was associated with a significantly longer hospital stay (6 days vs 1 day, p<0.001) and higher rates of in-hospital mortality (1.4% vs 0.9%, p=0.021), myocardial infarction (2.5% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), acute kidney injury (7.2% vs 1.4%, p<0.001), pneumonia (2.2% vs 0.7%, p<0.001), and surgical site infection (2.9% vs 0.0%, p<0.001) compared to infra-popliteal ET. At 1-year follow up, PDB was associated with significantly higher survival (86.7% vs 83.9%, p<0.001), amputation-free survival (72.6% vs 65.9%, p<0.001), and primary patency (73.6% vs 69.0%, p=0.002) and lower MALE (25.9% vs 30.1%, p=0.007) compared to infra-popliteal ET. PDB was associated with significantly higher amputation-free survival compared to infra-popliteal ET for both above-knee PDB (73.6% vs 65.9%, p<0.001) and below-knee PDB (71.9% vs 65.9%, p<0.001), with no difference observed between above-knee and below-knee PDB (p=0.407). Similarly, PDB was associated with significantly higher amputation-free survival compared to infra-popliteal ET for both PDB to a tibial artery (72.3% vs 65.9%, p<0.001) and PDB to a pedal artery (72.6% vs 65.9%, p<0.001), with no difference observed between PDB to a tibial artery and PDB to a pedal artery (p=0.860). Although its use has declined over the past decade, PDB continues to provide superior long-term outcomes in amputation-free survival, patency, and limb salvage compared to infra-popliteal ET in patients with infra-popliteal occlusive disease, albeit with a higher rate of perioperative mortality and morbidity. Careful preoperative risk assessment and thoughtful patient selection are essential to optimize the outcomes of isolated infra-popliteal interventions, ensuring that immediate procedural risks are appropriately weighed against the potential for improved longer-term outcomes in this patient population.",

Patients with no prior AF were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group or a sham group. The study app used the smartphone camera to generate photoplethysmography signals. If an arrhythmia was detected, patients in the intervention group received a notification and a 7-day patch electrocardiogram to confirm AF. A total of 1021 patients from 8 centers were randomized. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3.4 ± 0.92 in the intervention group and 3.5 ± 1.02 in the sham group. Arrhythmia was detected in 32 cases: 20 in the intervention group and 12 in the sham group. AF was diagnosed in 13 patients. AF detection rates were numerically higher in the intervention group (1.9% vs 0.5%; P = .094), especially in cases of asymptomatic AF (0.8% vs 0%; P = .13). There was no difference in the rate of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism after 6 months. In this multicenter trial, app usage in combination with early intervention did not significantly increase overall AF detection rates. However, asymptomatic AF detection was numerically higher in the intervention group, aligning with current guidelines that recommend photoplethysmography-based devices for AF screening.",

    "title": "Personalized External Aortic Root Support, the Dutch Experience.",
    "abstract": "Patients with connective tissue disease and aortic root aneurysm are at risk of dissection and progression of the dilation. Standard treatment of aortic root aneurysm is either a total root replacement or valve-sparing root replacement. Both procedures have drawbacks such as the need for anticoagulation and long term exposure to the chance of reoperation or endocarditis. The ExoVasc® Personalized External Aortic Root Support (PEARS) is a perivascular stent, that has been introduced to reduce these risks while aiming for a similar beneficial outcome on late aortic complications. To report the safety and efficacy of PEARS in the first 90 patients with connective tissue disease and aortic root aneurysm in the Netherlands. From January 2018 to February 2023, 90 patients underwent surgery with the intention of either an isolated PEARS procedure, or PEARS as a concomitant procedure or a Ross-PEARS procedure in two affiliated centers. Isolated PEARS was generally performed off-pump under sustained induced hypotension. Patient characteristics, preoperative and postoperative echocardiography and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were assessed. Median age was 37 (SD±15) years and 62 (69%) patients were male. Among all patients 37% had Marfan syndrome, 8% Loeys-Dietz syndrome and 32% had a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Sixty (67%) patients were planned for isolated PEARS, 21 (23%) underwent Ross-PEARS and 9 (10%) patients underwent PEARS as a concomitant procedure. Mean aortic root diameter at the level of the sinus of Valsalva was 44.6 ± 7.0 mm prior to surgery and 38.6 ± 5.6 mm at the follow-up (p < .001). Two patients in the isolated PEARS group were converted to conventional surgery, resulting in a procedural success rate of 96.6%. One Ross PEARS patient had to be reoperated on the first postoperative day because of compression of the RCA by the PEARS prosthesis. Median follow-up duration was 6 months (IQR 3-18, range 0-45). No death, endocarditis or dissection occurred during follow-up. One patient had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) 1 year after surgery (mitral valve plasty and PEARS as concomitant procedure). Three patients were reoperated in the follow-up period. At follow-up aortic root and ascending aortic diameters were all significantly reduced. The PEARS procedure can be performed with acceptable operative risk and no dissections were observed during follow-up. PEARS has been adapted as a valid alternative treatment strategy in our centers. Complications related to coronary artery origin are an important issue.",

    "title": "Development of a Customizable Web-Based Dashboard for Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring: Feasibility and Usability Implementation Study.",
    "abstract": "Effective blood pressure (BP) management is essential for several disease states, including secondary stroke prevention. Remote BP monitoring used in combination with an electronic data capture (EDC) system offers potential for improved BP control for patients. While such systems currently exist, there are many patient-, provider-, and system-specific challenges these systems currently do not address. In addition, such systems are rarely described transparently and comprehensively in the literature with enough detail to be reproduced by other clinicians. This study aims to describe the development and design of a web-based EDC system tailored for remote BP monitoring and management to overcome common patient-, provider-, and system-specific challenges. The EDC system was developed for use in the Video-based Intervention to Reduce Treatment and Outcome Disparities in Adults living with Stroke (VIRTUAL) and transient ischemic attack clinical trial, a randomized study involving adult stroke survivors receiving care for secondary stroke prevention. The EDC system supports remote monitoring using a BP monitor, which was specifically and methodically chosen for its suitability to the population. The EDC system integrates the data from the remote monitors into a web-based application, facilitating real-time monitoring for health care team intervention. The system includes a BP dashboard displaying time-series data, visual alerts, and email notifications for out-of-range readings. Proxy measures assessed system effectiveness in addressing patient-, provider-, and system-specific needs. Seventeen BP monitors were evaluated, and the BlipcareBlip BP800 was selected based on its cellular connectivity, ergonomic design, and application programming interface compatibility. The EDC system successfully linked patient data to the dashboard, enabling real-time visualization of BP trends and provider alerts. A total of 97% (184/190) of participants in the intervention arm engaged in BP monitoring, averaging 1.2 readings per day. Clinicians actively used the system, with mean monthly logins ranging from 19 to 44 per provider. Alerts were triggered for 69% (131/190) of participants, primarily for systolic BP abnormalities. Data transmission delays were minimal, with a median time of 1.4 minutes from data collection to dashboard entry. Outlier alerts were efficiently processed, with an average notification time of 17.9 hours. The system demonstrated high functionality in addressing patient-, provider-, and system-specific needs, supporting effective BP monitoring and intervention delivery. The VIRTUAL EDC system facilitates remote monitoring of BP in stroke survivors, offering a model for similar systems in clinical trials. Clinicians can analyze, track, and interpret monitored data in near real-time, remotely, which may enhance BP management approaches, particularly in communities with limited access to care. This approach has the potential to improve hypertension management for patients and clinicians when standard data transparency is insufficient, standard monitor features are incompatible with the user, or when integrating a commercial dashboard may threaten electronic health record security.",

    "title": "Global visualization exploration of post-stroke cardiac changes: A bibliometric analysis based on CiteSpace and VOSviewer.",
    "abstract": "Stroke and cardiovascular diseases are the two primary contributors to the global disease burden. Modern studies have progressively uncovered the intricate interplay between the brain and the heart, with cerebral injury influencing cardiac dysfunction, leading to a causative relationship. post-stroke cardiac changes, a common clinical disease caused by brain injury resulting in cardiac dysfunction, often presents medical challenges within the first few days after a stroke. Acute brain injuries can trigger heart failure even in the absence of primary heart disease, leading to potential long-term cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and heart failure. These complications have become the second leading cause of death after stroke, with approximately 2-6 % of stroke patients dying from cardiac causes within the first three months after an ischemic stroke. The pathophysiology of post-stroke cardiac changes is still under investigation, and there is no standardized clinical treatment or universally accepted therapeutic approach. This paper aims to review the current global research status and trends in post-stroke cardiac changes. Articles on post-stroke cardiac changes published from 1990 to 2025 were identified using the Web of Science Core Collection database. Bibliometric methods were employed to analyze authors, institutions, countries, journals, and references using CiteSpace and VOSviewer, including a total of 268 articles. The United States leads in the number of publications in this field, followed by Germany. Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin is a leading institution in post-stroke cardiac changes research. Luciano A. Sposato, Zhili Chen, Poornima Venkat, Jan F. Scheitz, Christian H. Nolte, and Matthias Endres have all made significant contributions to this field. The journals Stroke and Annals Of Neurology are considered the most influential in this field. Using cluster analysis, keywords were categorized into four main groups: (1) Stroke-Induced Cardiac Changes; (2) Stroke-Induced Risks and Outcomes; (3) Brain-Heart Interactions; (4) Stroke-Induced Neurogenic Cardiac Injury. This study systematically summarizes the research outcomes on post-stroke cardiac changes from 1990 to 2025, describing and predicting global research hotspots and trends. Research has found that the number of publications on this topic has been increasing significantly, and future research will constitute critical priorities in three domains: delineating brain-heart interplay mechanisms (particularly neurogenic pathways), characterizing the spectrum of stroke-induced cardiac alterations, and enhancing attention to early risk outcomes. Concurrently, efforts must prioritize refining and expanding therapeutic strategies, which holds significant promise for enhancing clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Short-term geomagnetic disturbances (GMD), quantified using the Kp index, are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality. This study aimed to investigate the impact of GMD on total, CVD, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) mortality in South Korea within the 2001-2019 period. Using generalized additive models, daily Kp index and mortality data were employed to assess the impact of GMD on mortality, with temporal trends and temperature included as confounders for adjustment. Given air pollution's potential confounding role, we adjusted for PM10 in sensitivity analyses evaluating Kp index effects on daily mortality. Mixed-effects meta-analysis was also performed to estimate overall seasonal mortality risk, accounting for spatial heterogeneity across districts. The results obtained showed a significant association between a one-standard-deviation increase in the z-score of the daily Kp index and an increase in total mortality across all seasons, with the strongest effects observed in spring (0.33 %) and autumn (0.32 %), followed by winter (0.29 %) and summer (0.25 %). Based on the daily Kp index values, CVD-related deaths increased significantly in all seasons except summer, stroke-related deaths in all except winter, and MI-related deaths only in winter. Further, this GMD-mortality association remained significant when daily Kp index values were replaced with moving averages and even after adjusting for PM10. These seasonal patterns might result from stronger GMD in spring and autumn, driven by Sun-Earth positional changes. Overall, the findings of this study provide valuable insights regarding the public health implications of GMD with respect to mortality in South Korea.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dihydrocapsaicin (DHC), a natural antioxidant derived from plants, has demonstrated pharmacological effects in various diseases. However, its research in the cardiovascular field remains relatively limited. This study aimed to explore the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of DHC on MI and its underlying mechanisms. The MI model was established by left coronary artery ligation. In vitro, the H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury model was established via oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Myocardial injury was assessed by echocardiography, infarct size, histopathological changes, and serological testing. TUNEL assay, Annexin V/PI staining assay, DHE, DCFH-DA staining and western blot analysis were used to validate cell apoptosis and oxidative stress level. The target of DHC was investigated using immunofluorescence, biotin pull-down assays, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS). Subsequently, the molecular mechanism of the interaction between Raf-1/ASK1 complex and DHC was investigated. Moreover, Raf-1 silencing or ASK1 overexpression H9c2 cardiomyocytes were used for further validation. DHC was found to exert anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, attenuating cardiac dysfunction and injury in the MI model and protecting against OGD-induced injury in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, Raf-1 was identified as a direct target of DHC. The protection of DHC against superoxide production and apoptotic cell death was compromised with Raf-1 silencing. Additionally, we found that DHC enhance the interaction between Raf-1 and ASK1, inhibiting the activation of the p-ASK1/p-JNK/p-P38 signaling pathway during OGD insult. The overexpression of ASK1 abolished the above protective effects of DHC. Our results demonstrated that DHC may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for attenuating cardiac dysfunction after MI by alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

For this study, we examined the mediating effects of mental and physical health on the association between chronic disease conditions and guideline-concordant colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among breast cancer survivors. We included 1,885 breast cancer survivors aged 45-75 years who were eligible for CRC screening in 2016, 2018, and 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The exposure was chronic diseases defined as prevalent diabetes, coronary heart disease/myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema/chronic bronchitis, arthritis, depressive disorders, or kidney diseases. The outcome was receipt of guideline-concordant CRC screening. Mediators were defined as self-reported frequent poor mental/physical health in the past 30 days (14-30 vs. 0-13 days). Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic and cancer-related factors. We used the methods proposed by Valeri & VanderWeele for the mediation analyses. Breast cancer survivors with chronic diseases were 1.7-fold more likely to have CRC screening compared to those without any chronic diseases (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.27-2.21). In mediation analysis, we found that frequent poor mental health mediated the association between chronic disease conditions and CRC screening utilization (-4.4% mediated; p-value = 0.035). We also observed a reduction through frequent poor physical health by 10.5% (p-value = 0.008). Frequent poor mental and physical health negatively mediated the association between the presence of chronic diseases and CRC screening utilization with a higher estimate for those with poor physical health. Effective implementation of integrated follow-up care is needed among breast cancer survivors to address chronic disease management and prioritize mental and physical health so that all patients receive guideline concordant CRC screening recommendations.",

We describe using this tool in a high-risk case without concomitant lead extraction. A 70-year-old man presented to our institution with Enterococcus faecalis sepsis. He had a history of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia and Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, and he had undergone implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Two intravascular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads were present: a 26-year-old dual coil and a 4-year-old single coil. Given the high extraction risk profile, vegetation aspiration alone was performed without concomitant lead extraction. The patient's subsequent clinical course was excellent. Cardiac implantable electronic device extraction is the standard of care after device-related endocarditis, but unique circumstances may necessitate a nonconventional approach. This case report raises the possibility that vegetation debulking alone may be an option in high-risk extraction cases.",

A retrospective analysis of the 2016-2021 National Inpatient Sample database identified patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF. Patients were categorized by age and frailty status (low, intermediate, high). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to examine outcomes. Among 292,395 patients, 79.2% were aged 35-65 years, 15.7% were aged 66-79 years, and 5.1% were aged ≥ 80 years at the time of ablation. The proportion of patients aged ≥ 80 years increased from 11% in 2016% to 21.1% in 2021. Females comprised a higher proportion of the oldest age group (51.4%), but no sex differences were observed across frailty levels. In-hospital mortality was highest in the high frailty group. Patients over 80 years had higher odds of cardiac rhythm restoration and pacemaker implantation but lower risks of cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Higher frailty was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, complications, and MACCE. Catheter ablation is increasingly performed in older patients. Advanced age and higher frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes. These factors should be considered when evaluating patients for this procedure, and strategies to mitigate these risks should be explored.",

This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyse the outcomes of IVUS-guided versus angiography-guided PCI in AMI. A comprehensive search across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI identified studies comparing IVUS- and angiography-guided PCI in AMI patients. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), cardiac death, and target vessel revascularization (TVR). A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nine studies with 838,902 patients (38,949 IVUS-guided and 796,953 angiography-guided) were included. IVUS-guided PCI significantly reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.78, p < 0.001), MACE (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.95, p = 0.001), cardiac death (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.87, p = 0.003), and TVR (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, p = 0.024) compared to angiography-guided PCI. Moderate heterogeneity was observed, but sensitivity analyses confirmed result stability. This meta-analysis indicates that IVUS-guided PCI in AMI patients improves clinical outcomes, including lower mortality, MACE, cardiac death, and TVR rates, compared to angiography guidance.

From 2005 to 2015, all cases of SDs involving individuals aged 1-35 years, who were citizens or permanent residents of the Republic of Cyprus, were recorded and studied. The incidence of SD in young individuals in Cyprus was 2.16 cases per 100 000 people annually. Out of the 74 recorded cases, cardiac causes were identified in 43.24% (n = 32) of SD cases, with 28.38% (n = 21) attributed to noncardiac factors. Cardiac causes predominated in males (n = 25/50, 50.00%), while noncardiac causes were more prevalent in females (n = 12/24, 50.00%). Among all SD cases, cardiomyopathies, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, accounted for 24.32% (n = 18) cases, followed by pulmonary embolism (n = 8, 10.81%) and viral myocarditis (n = 7, 9.46%) as the second and third leading causes, respectively. Other causes of SDs were myocardial infarction (n = 5, 6.76%), and hemorrhagic stroke (n = 4, 5.41%). Aortic aneurysm rupture, adrenal hemorrhage, and pulmonary aspiration each constituted 4.05% (n = 3) of SD cases. The cause of death remained indeterminate in 28.38% (n = 21) of SD cases. SD in the young is predominantly of cardiac origin, although a significant proportion of cases is also attributed to noncardiac causes.

    "abstract": "Bacterial DNA from the oral cavity, respiratory tract, gut, and skin has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a role in chronic inflammation linked to atherosclerosis. Chronic bacterial infections often form biofilms resistant to antibiotics and immune detection, giving rise to a new generation of virulent bacteria in suitable conditions. This study explores the role of the immune system in bacterial-induced inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques. Coronary plaques from 121 sudden death victims and endarterectomy samples from 96 surgical patients were analyzed using bacterial real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and genome-wide expression analysis. TLR (toll-like receptor) signaling was examined in bacterial-activated TLR cell lines. Of the bacteria detected, oral viridans group streptococcal DNA was the most common, being found in 42.1% of coronary plaques and 42.9% of endarterectomies. Immunopositivity for viridans streptococci correlated with severe atherosclerosis (P<0.0001) in both series and death from coronary heart disease (P=0.021) or myocardial infarction (P=0.042). Viridans streptococci colonized the core of the atheroma as a biofilm unrecognized by macrophages of the innate immune system. In contrast, immunopositive streptococci that appeared to have originated from the biofilm infiltrated the ruptured fibrous cap of the atheroma in endarterectomy samples and coronary plaques and were detected by pattern-recognizing receptors and coexpressed with the adaptive immune response. Among the viridans streptococcal strains, TLR2 was the most activated bacterial-signaling pathway. Genome-wide expression analysis of endarterectomy samples showed upregulation of bacterial recognition pathways. Latent chronic bacterial inflammation evades immune detection and may contribute to the pathogenesis of complicated atherosclerotic plaques and fatal myocardial infarction.",

We linked LAAO data to inpatient Medicare fee-for-service claims data using probabilistic matching to establish a cohort of patients 65 years and older undergoing LAAO with a WATCHMAN device. The primary outcomes were any stroke and all-cause mortality. A total of 34 975 patients with a mean±SD CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, and sex category) score of 4.7±1.4 were included. The median follow-up was 2.8 years (interquartile range, 2.2-3.7 years).

Long-term stroke rates in a large nationally representative cohort of Medicare patients following LAAO were low and durably consistent during long-term follow-up despite a high thromboembolic risk. High mortality rates in this elderly population underscore the importance of incorporating patient values and preferences when considering LAAO.",

We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to establish a causal relationship between ankylosing spondylitis and the risk of six prevalent CVDs: hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease. Furthermore, multivariate Mendelian randomization was employed to determine the influence of confounding factors. Genetically predicted ankylosing spondylitis increased the risk of heart failure according to the Mendelian randomization analysis (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.04; p = 0.030). Multivariate analysis results indicated that the causal relationship between ankylosing spondylitis and heart failure risk remained significant after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, smoking, body mass index, and pulse wave reflection index. The associations diminished and lost significance after adjusting for pulse wave peak-to-peak time and pulse wave arterial stiffness index.

    "title": "Macrophage Polarization in Myocardial Ischemia‒Reperfusion Injury: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Targets.",
    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a significant contributor to both morbidity and mortality worldwide. An effective therapeutic strategy for myocardial infarction is myocardial reperfusion via percutaneous coronary intervention and thrombolytic therapy. However, reperfusion may cause another inflammatory injury to surviving cardiomyocytes, inducing further cardiomyocyte death, increasing infarct size and even leading to heart failure. Current clinical interventions mostly target a single pathology and fail to effectively regulate the repair process in the later stages of injury, resulting in limited therapeutic efficacy. Recent studies have shown that macrophages play a dual role in ischemia‒reperfusion injury: dynamic changes in their phenotype directly determine the balance between the inflammatory response and tissue repair. In addition, macrophages play a key intersection role in multiple pathological mechanisms, including but not limited to, the regulation of oxidative stress, the drive of programmed cell death, and the remodeling of the microenvironment. This review summarizes the mechanisms of macrophage injury in myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion and potential strategies for macrophage-centric targeted therapy. Currently, most studies on potential therapeutic targets are still at the animal experimental stage. Owing to simplified disease models, macrophage therapy is still not well studied in terms of target mechanisms and microenvironmental metabolic reprogramming. In addition, the clinical feasibility of targeted therapies remains to be verified owing to their low delivery efficiency and off-target effects, and further clinical studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies. In the future, macrophage-related drug research is expected to lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the benefits of gypensapogenin I (GI) on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and the underlying mechanisms. An MIRI model was established by ligating the anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by blood flow restoration in mice. Cardiac dysfunction and myocardial infarction size were evaluated by echocardiography and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. PANoptosis, ferroptosis, and mitochondrial redox state were examined by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and an ELISA kit. In addition, molecular and biochemical methods were applied to illustrate the exact mechanisms of GI on MIRI. GI pretreatment alleviated cellular oxidative stress, inhibited PANoptosis and ferroptosis, reduced myocardial infarction area, and improved cardiac function during MIRI. Further results revealed that mitochondrial biogenesis and the anti-oxidative system were impaired in mice suffering from MIRI, and these effects were significantly alleviated by GI treatment via downregulation of the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) level. Moreover, NOX2 promoted mitochondrial dysfunction by suppressing the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-PGC-1α-Sirt3 signaling pathway. In addition, the NOX2 activator exacerbated oxidative damage and offset all the beneficial effects of GI on mitochondrial function, PANoptosis, and ferroptosis. Meanwhile, reinforced AMPK phosphorylation by GI or AMPK activator (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, AICAR) maintained the mitochondrial redox state and biogenesis and suppressed PANoptosis and ferroptosis. GI pretreatment protected the cardiomyocytes from MIRI-induced PANoptosis and ferroptosis by maintaining the mitochondrial redox state and biogenesis through the modulation of the NOX2/AMPK signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that GI pretreatment could be a promising therapeutic agent for MIRI treatment.",

To investigate whether elevated Lp(a) predicted cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) admitted to hospital. Serum Lp(a) concentrations were measured in 520 consecutively recruited patients admitted to hospital with IHD, half of whom had an acute myocardial infarction. Patients with elevated Lp(a) at baseline were compared with patients with non-elevated Lp(a). In this observational prospective cohort study, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of baseline Lp(a) with hazard rates (HR) of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). During the 2-year follow-up period, 14.6%, 8.5%, and 49.2% of patients had all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and MACE respectively. Median age was 63.5 years, 82.3% were male and the median Lp(a) was 35.2 nmol/L. Multivariable Cox regression showed baseline Lp(a) ≥70 nmol/L was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.97 [1.20-3.22], p=0.007) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.01 [1.06-3.82], p=0.033), but was not statistically significant for MACE (HR 1.29 [0.98-1.7], p=0.067). Higher natural log-transformed Lp(a) concentrations predicted all-cause mortality (HR 1.25 [1.01-1.58], p=0.042) but not for cardiovascular mortality or MACE. In a multi-ethnic Asian patient cohort, elevated Lp(a) concentrations ≥70 nmol/L at hospitalization positively predicted cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with ischaemic heart disease.

The impact of KDIGO AKI staging on post-discharge short- and long-term outcomes, particularly early-stage AKI, is not well understood. This study evaluates the prognostic implications of various KDIGO stages in AMI patients. Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (version 3.0) database, this retrospective cohort study included adult patients primarily diagnosed with AMI. Statistical analyses, including doubly robust estimation, propensity score matching, logistic regression, and Cox regression, were performed. The study compared Non-AKI (KDIGO stage 0) with Mild-AKI (maximum KDIGO stage 1 during hospitalization), and Normal-or-mild AKI (KDIGO stages 0-1) with Moderate-to-severe AKI (KDIGO stages 2-3). Among 5,715 patients analyzed, 4,306 (75.36%) developed AKI. Doubly robust analysis revealed no significant differences in outcomes between Non-AKI and Mild-AKI groups (28-day mortality: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68-1.38; 180-day mortality: HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76-1.18; 1-year mortality: HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.20). However, Moderate-to-severe AKI was significantly associated with worse outcomes compared to Normal-or-mild AKI (28-day mortality: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.36-2.05; 180-day mortality: HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10; 1-year mortality: HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.38; all p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients under 65 years with Mild-AKI showed higher risks of 180-day and 1-year mortality compared to Non-AKI, while Moderate-to-severe AKI consistently demonstrated worse outcomes across all subgroups (age, SOFA score, heart failure status, and renal disease status). These findings were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Patients with Mild-AKI can be considered as having \"subclinical AKI,\" with prognoses similar to Non-AKI patients. In contrast, Moderate-to-severe AKI significantly worsens prognosis compared to Normal-or-mild AKI.",

Methods: We utilized silencing and overexpression of Nanog gene in ADMSCs and performed a wound healing assay/transwell migration assay/MTT cell viability assay/left coronary artery ligation for AMI induction. Additionally, we categorized the cells into three classes [i.e., (ADMSCs and NanogOE-ADMSCs); A1 (ADMSCs)/A2 (ADMSCs + CoCl2)/A3 (NanogOE-ADMSCs + CoCl2)/A4 (siRNA-Nanog-ADMSCs) + CoCl2); B1 (ADMSCs)/B2 (ADMSCs + H2O2)/B3 (NanogOE-ADMSCs + H2O2)/B4 (siRNA-Nanog gene in ADMSCs + H2O2)], and the rats (n=50) were evenly divided into Groups 1 (sham-operated control)/2 (AMI)/3 (AMI+ADMSCs)/4 (AMI+NanogOE-ADMSCs)/5 (AMI+siRNA-Nanog-ADMSCs). The hearts were harvested on Day 35. Results: In vitro experiments revealed significantly higher ATP, relative mitochondrial DNA/Nonog gene expression, mitochondrial cytochrome C+ cell, angiogenesis and exosome-specific marker (Alix/CD81/CD63/CD9) levels in NanogOE-ADMSCs than in ADMSCs. The cell viability, wound healing, and migration were highest in A1, lowest in A4, and significantly greater in A3 than in A2, whereas early/late apoptosis and intracellular and mitochondrial ROS displayed the opposite pattern of cell viability among the groups (all P<0.001). Additionally, the proteins expressions of phosphorylation (p) of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p-JAK2/p-STAT3, and Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathways were highest in A3, lowest in A4 and significantly greater in A1 than in A2 (all P<0.001). The levels of cell cycle proteins and mitochondrial electron transport train (ETC) complex I/II/III/IV components exhibited identical patterns as PI3K/Akt/mTOR among the groups B1 to B4 (all P<0.001). On Day 35, the LVEF was highest in Group 1, lowest in Group 2, significantly greater in Group 4 than in Groups 3 and 5, and significantly greater in Group 3 than in Group 5, with the opposite pattern for the LV remodeling index, infarct and fibrosis areas, and LV chamber size (all P < 0.0001). The p-AK/p-STAT3, p-PI3K/p-Akt/p-mTOR, and Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 protein levels displayed the same pattern as the LVEF among the groups (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: NanogOE-ADMSCs rescued LVEF by upregulating JAK/STAT3-mediated cell proliferation/cell stress pathways and accelerating the cell cycle.",

Antibody-based assays face challenges, prompting the exploration of aptamers. This study develops an aptamer-HRP probe and ELASA for improved cTnI detection. Aptamer-based enzyme-linked aptamer assays (ELASA) were developed to detect cTnI using Tro4 and Tro6 aptamers. Molecular docking was performed via the HDOCK web server to confirm aptamer binding affinity to cTnI. Tro4 was biotinylated for use as a capture probe, while Tro6 was conjugated to HRP through sulfo-SMCC crosslinking, followed by size exclusion chromatography and purification. Direct and sandwich ELASA assays were performed using streptavidin-coated plates and clinical serum samples from AMI and non-AMI patients. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism10 and SPSS software. Molecular docking confirmed the high binding affinity of Tro4 and Tro6 aptamers to cTnI, with significant interaction energies. Direct ELASA verified aptamer binding, and optimal concentrations were determined as 10μM for Tro4 and 5μM for Tro6. A sandwich ELASA using paired aptamers achieved improved sensitivity and specificity for cTnI detection. The assay displayed a linear response between 0.1-22 ng.mL cTnI (R²=0.94), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.10ng.mL. When tested on patient serum samples, results correlated with a commercial antibody-based ELASA kit. This study successfully developed a highly sensitive and specific sandwich ELASA for cTnI detection, utilizing the optimal aptamers Tro4 and Tro6. The results demonstrated excellent sensitivity, specificity, and potential clinical applicability, offering a promising alternative to antibody-based assays.",

This systematic review aims to evaluate whether empagliflozin reduces mortality and hospitalization rates compared to placebo in this population. We identified five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from PubMed and ScienceDirect up to May 2024, which compared empagliflozin to placebo in patients with recent AMI. A total of 7229 participants were included. The primary outcomes were reductions in mortality and hospitalization rates, while secondary outcomes included changes in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Empagliflozin did not significantly reduce cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization rates. However, some studies reported a statistically significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels of up to 15% in the empagliflozin group. Additionally, a 1.5% greater increase in LVEF was observed in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo in certain studies. Although empagliflozin has a favorable safety profile and shows positive effects on biomarkers related to heart failure (HF), current evidence does not support its use as an effective intervention for reducing mortality or hospitalizations in AMI patients.

As a control group, we analyzed 17 age-matched healthy volunteers (mean age 51.5 ± 8.6, 47% of women). In addition to routinely obtaining clinical and laboratory data, we analyzed plasma concentrations of the aforementioned biomarkers using ELISA and Luminex analyses. Patients with MI did not differ from healthy controls in total cholesterol, LDL, non-HDL, and triglyceride levels. PCSK9, BMP-4, and sE-selectin levels did not differ significantly between the MI and the control group. Patients with MI had significantly higher sENG and Endocan levels than the control group. In addition, levels of sENG were significantly higher in patients with higher body mass index (BMI) and in smokers.

Given differences in patient characteristics across studies, there may be differences in AF detection rates on ICM across these subgroups that have not been identified. We investigate whether AF detection rates on ICM are higher in cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (C-IS/TIA) patients compared with individuals with noncryptogenic stroke or without stroke, when accounting for differences in study populations. This is an individual-participant data meta-analysis of prospective studies and randomized controlled trials of ICM in C-IS/TIA, noncryptogenic ischemic stroke, and nonstroke patients. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models were used to test whether C-IS/TIA is associated with increased AF detection relative to other categories. We performed multiple imputation to derive values for variables with <20% missing data and used Rubin's rules to estimate adjusted odds ratios by combining 100 postimputation data sets. The primary outcome was detection of AF. The attributable risk was derived by application of Bayes' Theorem. Two randomized controlled trials and 12 prospective studies were included with a total of 1562 C-IS/TIA patients and 474 non-C-IS/TIA patients. In adjusted multilevel logistic regression analyses, AF detection was higher in C-IS/TIA patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.18-3.06]; P=0.009), indicating that 47% of AF detected in C-IS/TIA is pathogenic. Limiting the comparator group to ischemic stroke or history of stroke yielded similar results (adjusted odds ratio, 2.83 [95% CI, 1.47-5.44]; P=0.002). Days to AF detection were significantly shorter in C-IS/TIA patients (median 65 versus 169; P<0.001). In this individual-participant data meta-analysis of patients undergoing ICM, AF detection was higher in C-IS/TIA patients, with shorter time to AF detection compared with noncryptogenic/nonstroke individuals.

However, autologous sources (bone marrow and adipose tissue) require substantially invasive harvest procedures while allogeneic MSC from the cord raise the issue of batch to batch variability. This study assessed the effects of another under-investigated cell source: the skeletal muscle whose autologous MSC feature the clinically appealing advantage of being retrievable by a minimally invasive microbiopsy. MSC differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were selected as controls as they also look clinically attractive because of their high scalability and high degree of reproducibility. In vitro, muscle-derived (md) MSC exhibited typical MSC features including a tri-lineage differentiation potential and had robust angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immune-modulatory effects. Overall, they outperformed iPSC-MSC which raised a safety concern linked to the persistence of some pluripotency-associated markers. They were thus chosen for the subsequent in vivo evaluation in a rat model of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction induced by ischemia/reperfusion. To this end, mdMSC were embedded in a collagen bioprinted gel; the resulting epicardially-delivered patch significantly improved LV ejection fraction compared to a cell-free patch and sham-operated controls. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that this benefit was accompanied by a downregulation of fibrosis-, apoptosis-, and inflammation-related genes. This exploratory proof-of-concept study thus suggests that mdMSC offer an attractive alternative because they combine an autologous origin with a minimally invasive harvest procedure. Bioprinting these cells with a collagen bioink allows to generate a patch endowed with cardio-reparative properties.",

Noise levels at the four study sites exceeded the three thresholds set by the WHO based on the exposure-response relationship between RTN and cardiovascular disease: the daytime and nighttime NOAEL values of 60 dB(A) and 50 dB(A), the nighttime threshold of 45 dB(A), and the overall Lden threshold of 53 dB(A). Furthermore, the degree of exceeding the standard value was higher in commercial and industrial areas than in residential areas.

A key contributor to this dysfunction is excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is activated by MI and exacerbates EC apoptosis and impaired angiogenesis. Here we investigate the role of endothelial-specific protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) in mitigating ER stress and promoting vascular homeostasis after MI. We demonstrate that PRMT7 expression is upregulated in ECs under tumor necrosis factor α or tunicamycin treatment, while its inhibition exacerbates ER stress and induces EC death. Using endothelial-specific PRMT7-knockout models, we show that PRMT7 deficiency increases apoptosis and fibrosis, impairing cardiac recovery. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that PRMT7 loss leads to the upregulation of pro-apoptotic pathways and suppression of angiogenic and proliferative signaling. Conversely, PRMT7 overexpression or treatment with the PRMT7-inducing drug bindarit restores EC function, suppresses ER stress and enhances revascularization and cardiac repair after MI. These findings establish endothelial PRMT7 as a critical regulator of EC survival and function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to mitigate ER stress and improve post-MI cardiac recovery.",

    "abstract": "ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) outcomes have improved through initiatives that promote timely access to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, little is known about how primary PCI is performed across different settings. This study proposes to characterize and compare practical aspects of primary PCI globally. An electronic survey, assessing thirteen aspects potentially affecting primary PCI timing and efficacy, was distributed to interventional cardiologists in the \"Stent-Save a Life!\" initiative. Comparisons were made based on geographical locations and annual PCI volume. Seven hundred-and-twenty-four responses were received (59 % from Europe, 18 % from Latin America, 15 % from Asia, 9 % from Africa); 88 % of participants worked in high-volume primary PCI centers. African operators generally performed ≤75 primary PCIs annually, in contrast to their counterparts in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Access route varied significantly across regions: radial access was used in 98 % of primary PCIs in Europe but only 53 % in Africa. Left ventriculography was more frequently performed in Latin America (25 %) and Africa (20 %) than in Europe (9 %) and Asia (6 %). Aspiration thrombectomy was performed under different conditions. Non-culprit lesion revascularization was typically completed during the index procedure or before discharge, except in Asia. Most participants from Europe (82 %) and Asia (85 %) reported pretreating their patients with P2Y12 inhibitors. High-volume operators were more likely to work in 24/7 PCI hospitals, prefer radial access, and routinely perform thrombus aspirations and PCI on non-infarct-related arteries after discharge. This global survey identified procedural variations in performing primary PCI, indicating room for improvement, particularly in the African region.",

    "abstract": "The Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Intensive Care Unit (ACTION ICU) score is a tool for assessing the risk of complications associated with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The study aimed to describe the usefulness of the ACTION ICU score in Mexican patients with NSTEMI. A single-center, retrospective, observational, and comparative study of patients with NSTEMI admitted between January 2017 and December 2023; patients with respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, shock, and arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker on admission were excluded from the study. Based on the collected data, the ACTION ICU score was applied to all patients. The cutoff score for ICU admission is 5, with a 9.3% risk of complications. During hospitalization, the composite primary outcome included cardiac arrest, shock, heart block requiring a pacemaker, respiratory failure, stroke, or death. The score's performance was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 345 NSTEMI patients were included; 41 (14.2%) developed the primary outcome. The most common complications were shock (12.5%) and respiratory failure (8.1%). A score of 0 to 5 points was present in 187 patients (54.2%), 10 of whom (5.3%) developed the primary outcome. The score had an AUC of 0.77 [CI 0.64-0.97, p value 0.01]. The ACTION ICU score showed acceptable discriminative ability for identifying patients with NSTEMI who need ICU care, providing a valuable tool to predict complications and implement best practices in medical units with limited resources.

    "title": "Pathophysiology of myocardial currents of injury: contributions of new electrocardiographic methods.",
    "abstract": "Diastolic and systolic currents of injury are fundamental for understanding electrocardiographic alterations in acute myocardial ischemia. These currents result from electrical gradients between ischemic and healthy zones, driven by differences in depolarization and repolarization. The diastolic current, directed toward healthy tissue, and the systolic current, oriented toward the injured region, explain phenomena such as TQ depression (diastolic current of injury) and QRS complex modifications accompanied by ST-segment deviations (systolic current of injury). Historical and contemporary studies have elucidated the underlying pathophysiology of these currents, emphasizing changes in radial myocardial activation, alterations in electrical vectors, and the potential presence of intramural conduction blocks. Furthermore, precise correlations between these electrocardiographic findings and acute ischemic events have been demonstrated in both experimental and clinical models. Understanding these currents not only facilitates the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia but also enhances the capacity for prompt intervention. This knowledge underscores the central role of the electrocardiogram in clinical practice and cardiovascular research. Las corrientes de lesión, diastólica y sistólica, son fundamentales para comprender las alteraciones electrocardiográficas en la isquemia miocárdica aguda. Estas corrientes se originan debido a los gradientes eléctricos entre las zonas isquémicas y sanas, derivados de diferencias en la despolarización y la repolarización. La corriente diastólica, dirigida hacia el tejido sano, y la sistólica, orientada hacia la región lesionada, explican fenómenos como el infradesnivel del TQ (corriente de lesión diastólica) y las modificaciones en el complejo QRS con desviaciones en el segmento ST (corriente de lesión sistólica). Estudios históricos y contemporáneos han establecido la fisiopatología subyacente a estas corrientes, destacando cambios en la activación radial del miocardio, alteraciones en los vectores eléctricos y posibles bloqueos intramurales. Además, se han identificado correlaciones precisas entre estos hallazgos electrocardiográficos y los eventos isquémicos agudos en modelos experimentales y clínicos. La comprensión de estas corrientes no solo facilita el diagnóstico de la isquemia miocárdica, sino que también mejora la capacidad para intervenir de manera oportuna.

To determine image adequacy and interpretation accuracy of paramedics performing cPoCUS for assessment of LV function and wall motion abnormality (WMA). This was a prospective observation pilot study of ultrasound-naïve paramedics who participated in a clinical education program to identify OMI and performed cPoCUS during transport of adult patients. Primary outcomes were proportion of patients with 12-lead ECG who received cPoCUS, quality of images obtained, and paramedic interpretations (overall LV function and presence of a WMA). Sensitivity and specificity for LV function and WMA were calculated along with Cohen's kappa (κ) comparing paramedic interpretation to ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency physicians. Of paramedics who passed a clinical evaluation (n = 14) and written test (n = 10), six opted to participate. Of the 201 eligible cases, 88.6% received cPoCUS during their transport to the hospital. Adequate views for LV function and WMA were obtained among 61.2% and 38.8% of patients, respectively. Accurate paramedic interpretations for LV function and WMA were made among 83/94 (88.3%) and 54/56 (96.4%) patients, respectively. There was moderate agreement between paramedics and physicians on LV function (κ = 0.41), with 41.7% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity. No patients presented with WMA. With brief training, paramedics were able to acquire adequate cPoCUS images for LV function assessment, and interpretations were largely accurate.",

    "abstract": "Accurate ECG interpretation is crucial to identify occlusive myocardial infarction (OMI) to determine the need for immediate catheterization laboratory activation (CLA). STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECG patterns deviate from conventional STEMI criteria, risking misclassification of OMI cases. The diagnostic accuracy for these complex ECGs is unknown. This study aimed to measure physician accuracy for interpreting STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECGs for catheterization laboratory activation (CLA) and compare their performance to a machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm, Queen of Hearts AI (QoH AI). Fifty-three EPs and 42 cardiologists interpreted 18 ECGs (eight STEMI-equivalents, eight STEMI-mimics, with one STEMI, and a normal ECG as controls) to determine the presence of OMI requiring immediate CLA. The same ECGs were analyzed by QoH AI. Interpretations were compared against a reference standard based on angiography, troponin, echocardiography, and clinical follow-up. Interpretation accuracies were similar between EPs and cardiologists (65.6 %, 95 % CI [51, 78]; 65.5 %, 95 % CI [51, 77], respectively; p = 0.969), and significantly lower than QoH AI (88.9 %, 95 % CI [82, 93]) vs. physicians overall, 65.6 %, 95 % CI [52, 77]; p < 0.001). Physicians most frequently misclassified de Winter, Transient STEMI, Hyperacute T-wave OMI, and bundle branch block ECGs. QoH AI only misclassified left bundle branch block with OMI and left ventricular aneurysm without OMI. Physicians frequently misinterpret STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECGs, potentially impacting CLA decisions. QoH AI demonstrated superior accuracy, suggesting a potential to reduce missed OMIs and unnecessary catheterization laboratory activations. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of comprehensive longitudinal studies examining the impact of long-term volatility on health issues, existing research primarily focused on income levels rather than fluctuation. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between income instability and a range of physical health conditions using an extensive longitudinal dataset. This study utilized data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) Ansan-Anseong cohort (2001-2022), which includes valuable confounding factors such as demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. Income volatility was calculated as the intra-individual standard deviation of income changes across study waves. A Cox proportional hazards model was employed to assess correlations between income volatility and the risk of 12 non-communicable diseases (NCDs; hypertension, myocardial infarction [MI], coronary artery disease [CAD], cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gout, gastric disease, renal disease, arthritis, allergic disease, and asthma). A total of 9,185 participants (mean age, 52.21; male, 47.59%) were analyzed. In the fully adjusted model, medium volatility was correlated with a higher disease risk (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.21), as similar to high volatility (1.09; 1.03-1.16). The highest risk was observed in individuals experiencing income decreases (1.61; 1.13-2.28). All health conditions examined in this study showed an increased risk correlated with higher income volatility as follows: hypertension (1.13; 1.03-1.25); MI (2.15; 1.33-3.48); CAD (1.37; 1.04-3.48); cerebrovascular disease (1.69; 1.21-2.37); hyperlipidemia (1.14; 1.01-1.28); gout (2.11; 1.12-3.95); gastric disease (1.15; 1.01-1.32); renal disease (2.28; 1.22-4.25); arthritis (1.33; 1.04-1.70); allergic disease (1.54; 1.16-2.03); asthma (1.67; 1.04-1.67). Income volatility, particularly income decreases and fluctuations, is significantly correlated with higher risk of chronic NCDs in South Korea. These findings underscore the need to develop interventions to mitigate financial instability, thereby improving public health outcomes.",

    "title": "Zika virus infection in neonatal mice disrupts connexin 43 and induces cardiac inflammation, implicating viral myocarditis in neonatal pathogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites and, occasionally, via breast milk, making postnatal ZIKV infections common among newborns and infants, particularly in tropical regions. Previous studies, including ours, have demonstrated that neonatal ZIKV infection can be fatal, highlighting a severe health issue of ZIKV in newborns. However, the pathogenesis and functional outcomes of postnatal ZIKV infection remain largely unexplored. The mechanisms underlying organ failure in infected neonates are still unknown. Here, we investigated postnatal ZIKV (PRVABC59) infection in neonatal mice and found significant cardiac abnormalities. Electrocardiogram (EKG) analysis revealed extended P-R intervals (indicative of the atrioventricular block), widened QRS complexes (suggesting intraventricular block), and elevated ST wave (a biomarker of myocardium impairment), implying defects in myocardial conduction. In addition, ZIKV infection caused increased levels of cTnT, cTnI, CK, CK-MB, CCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10-biomarkers associated with cardiovascular diseases and infarction-like myocardial pathology. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine responses and observed a significant increase in multiple inflammatory mediators, including M-CSF, LIF, IL-6, IL-15, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, TNF-α, and VEGF. Notably, ZIKV infection also led to the degradation of connexin 43 (Cx43), a critical protein involved in heart development and intercellular communication among myocardial cells. In summary, our neonatal mouse model of ZIKV infection suggests that ZIKV-induced myocarditis and cardiac dysfunction may contribute to fatal outcomes in newborns. These findings provide new insights into ZIKV pathogenesis and underscore the need for further research into its impact on the cardiovascular system in early life.IMPORTANCEZika virus (ZIKV) is a known teratogen responsible for microcephaly in neonates born to mothers infected during pregnancy. Mouse models have been instrumental in elucidating ZIKV pathogenesis; however, most published studies utilize interferon (IFN)-compromised animals, either genetically modified or antibody-treated. In this study, we employed immunocompetent neonatal mice to investigate postnatal ZIKV infection and uncovered its impact on heart function. We detected high viral loads in heart tissue at early, middle, and late stages of infection using RT-qPCR. Electrocardiogram (EKG) analysis demonstrated cardiac dysfunction, including conduction abnormalities. At the same time, elevated levels of cTnT, cTnI, CK, CK-MB, LDH, α-HBDH, CCL2, and CXCL10-hallmarks of cardiovascular pathology-suggested inflammatory responses associated with heart failure. These findings indicate that neonatal mortality following postnatal ZIKV infection may be driven by virus-induced cardiac dysfunction. Our results provide new insights into ZIKV pathogenesis, suggesting that postnatal ZIKV infection poses a significant risk for severe cardiac disease in neonates.",

    "abstract": "Women with prior gestational diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but whether and to what extent this risk is modifiable is unknown. NHSII (Nurses' Health Study II) participants (N=4355), who reported a gestational diabetes diagnosis between 1989 and 2001 and were free of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and cancer at baseline were included. Incident CVD included nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal/fatal stroke, angiographically confirmed angina, and coronary revascularizations. Modifiable factors were updated every 2 to 4 years. Optimal modifiable factors included body mass index <25.0 kg/m2, favorable Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 score (top 40%), ≥150 minutes moderate-intensity or ≥75 minutes vigorous-intensity physical activity/week, noncurrent smoking, and moderate alcohol intake (5.0-14.9 g/day). Multivariable-adjusted Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs with CVD. During a median 27.9 years of follow-up, 188 incident CVD events occurred. Compared with women with zero optimal factors, HR for CVD among women with one, two, three, or four optimal factors was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.22-1.42), 0.40 (95% CI, 0.16-1.02), 0.32 (95% CI, 0.12-0.84), and 0.14 (95% CI, 0.05-0.46), respectively (P-trend<0.0001).

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (PCSK9i), including monoclonal antibodies and small interfering RNA-based therapies, have shown promise as adjuncts to statins, although their efficacy for coronary plaque regression, as assessed by intravascular imaging, remains uncertain.MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis to compare the treatment efficacy of statins combined with PCSK9i (PCSK9i group) versus statins alone or statins combined with placebo (control group) in adults with coronary atherosclerosis (INPLASY registration number: INPLASY202550027). Plaque lesions were assessed using intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, coronary computed tomography angiography, and near-infrared spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a serious complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. While risk factors are known, predicting CIN remains difficult. New biomarkers like the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are gaining attention as potential predictors due to their links with inflammation and coagulation. This meta-analysis examines whether NLR and PLR can predict CIN risk in PCI patients with ACS, aiming to clarify their diagnostic value. We analyzed data from 25 studies with 25,505 patients, looking at the link between preprocedural NLR and PLR and CIN risk. We calculated odds ratios (OR), sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values to assess diagnostic accuracy. A total of 25,505 patients from 25 studies were included. Elevated preprocedural NLR and PLR were significantly associated with increased CIN risk. In the ACS population, 15 studies demonstrated that NLR was significantly associated with increased odds of CIN, with a pooled OR of 1.21 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 1.30, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed moderate sensitivity (72%), specificity (60%), and an AUC of 71%. Similar trends were observed in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The non-STEMI (NSTEMI) subgroup showed a stronger association, with a pooled OR of 2.03 (95% CI: 1.13 to 3.65, p = 0.02), moderate to good diagnostic accuracy (AUC 79%), and higher sensitivity (77%) and specificity (73%). For PLR, significant associations with CIN were found in the ACS population (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.30, p = 0.007), with moderate diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.73). In the STEMI population, PLR was also significantly associated with CIN (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.57, p < 0.001), but diagnostic accuracy was lower (AUC: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.74). Limited data from the NSTEMI population showed a moderate association (AUC: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.72), indicating fair diagnostic accuracy. Preprocedural NLR and PLR are simple, cost-effective biomarkers for predicting CIN risk in ACS, especially among NSTEMI patients undergoing PCI. These markers can facilitate earlier identification of high-risk patients and enable targeted preventive strategies. However, their moderate diagnostic performance highlights the need for the development of more specific and sensitive biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Imatinib, the first Abl-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), improved leukemia outcomes without cardiovascular side effects. Newer agents, including ponatinib, addressed imatinib resistance, improving cancer remission, but substantially increased arterial thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The mechanism behind ponatinib-induced thrombosis and the cardiovascular effect of asciminib, a newly approved Abl-TKI, remain unknown. The effect of clinically relevant plasma concentrations of imatinib, ponatinib, and asciminib were compared with vehicle in vivo using SR-BI-mut/LDLR-knockout (KO) mice to assess spontaneous MI and stroke risk. The mechanism was interrogated in C57BL/6J mice, assessing leukocyte trafficking and thromboinflammation by intravital microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, and in ApoE-KO mice, assessing plaque phenotype by flow cytometry and histology. In vitro effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) and human coronary artery ECs was determined by flow cytometry, PCR, and immunoblotting. The role of TNF (tumor necrosis factor) signaling was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA knockdown. In SR-BI-mut/LDLR-KO mice, ponatinib significantly accelerated death from MI and stroke compared with vehicle, imatinib, and asciminib. In human ECs, only ponatinib increased expression of TNF receptors (TNFRs) and adhesion molecules (P-selectin, ICAM1 [intercellular adhesion molecule 1], and VCAM1 [vascular cell adhesion molecule 1]). Ponatinib rapidly induced TNFR2 membrane trafficking and TNF signaling in human umbilical vein ECs. TNFR inhibition or TNFR2 knockdown prevented ponatinib induction of EC adhesion molecules. In vivo, ponatinib increased mesenteric vessel adhesion molecules, leukocyte rolling and adhesion to vessels, leukocyte and platelet activation, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates. In ApoE-KO mice, ponatinib increased plaque necrotic core and inflammation, consistent with a rupture-prone phenotype. Asciminib-treated mice developed none of these in vitro or in vivo toxicities. In C57BL/6J mice, TNFR inhibition blocked ponatinib-induced mesenteric adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte trafficking, but not platelet-leukocyte aggregation. TNFR blockade prevented ponatinib-induced plaque inflammation in ApoE-KO mice and MI and stroke in SR-BI-mut/LDLR-KO mice. Ponatinib, a potent anticancer therapy, activates ECs, platelets, and leukocytes, driving plaque inflammation and death from MI and stroke in mice, mirroring clinical cardiotoxicities in patients with cancer. Asciminib did not induce these effects, suggesting it might be a safer option for imatinib-resistant patients with cancer. Inhibition of TNFR-mediated endothelial activation is sufficient to prevent ponatinib-induced major adverse cardiovascular events.",

    "title": "Association Between Depression and Medication Adherence Among Post-myocardial Infarction Patients in a South Asian Clinical Setting.",
    "abstract": " Medication adherence is vital for successful recovery after a myocardial infarction (MI). Unfortunately, many patients experience depression following an MI, which can negatively affect their ability to stick to prescribed medication plans. It is important to explore how depression influences medication adherence, especially in South Asian clinical environments where cultural factors can significantly impact health outcomes. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 385 post-MI patients who attended outpatient clinics in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depression, and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) was used to quantify medication adherence. Statistical tests involved descriptive statistics, normality tests using Shapiro-Wilk, Spearman correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and linear regression. Data were collected between January and May 2025. There was also a weak, statistically significant positive relation between the PHQ-9 and the MMAS-8 scores (r = 0.124, p < 0.05). In a linear regression model, PHQ-9 scores were significantly predictive of MMAS-8 scores (B = 0.064, p = 0.002), which means that the higher the depressive symptoms, the more likely medication adherence was. Depression scores worsened over time since MI and heavier medication burden, whereas adherence was highest among patients taking moderate numbers of medications (three to five/day). The rates of adherence and psychological distress also differed significantly depending on the treatment type, with the best rates being in angioplasty patients. This study, unlike the majority of the previous findings, reported a minor positive correlation between self-reported medication adherence and depressive symptoms in post-MI patients. The findings indicate that, in particular, in the cultural backdrop, depressive symptoms can be present alongside more health conscientiousness or planned-out care use.

    "abstract": "Time in range (TIR), a glycemic control metric, is increasingly linked to diabetes outcomes. A target of 140-180 mg/dL is recommended for critically ill hyperglycemic patients. This cohort study analyzed 6,047 critically ill diabetic patients (median age 68, 62.3 % male) from the MIMIC-IV database. TIR (140-180 mg/dL) was defined as the percentage of time within the target glucose range over 24 h. Patients were stratified by TIR quartiles. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 28-day mortality. Cox models assessed TIR-outcomes relationships. Higher TIR correlated with lower mortality. Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.00 (Q1), 0.63 (Q2), 0.56 (Q3), and 0.65 (Q4) (p for trend < 0.001). Similar trends were observed for in-hospital mortality (Q4 vs. Q1: HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.97). Each 10 % TIR increase reduced all-cause mortality by 8 % (HR 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.88-0.95). Nonlinear dose-response relationships were significant (p < 0.001), with stronger effects in patients < 60, males, and those with myocardial infarction or cancer history (p for interaction < 0.05). Higher TIR (140-180 mg/dL) is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill diabetic patients, suggesting that TIR is a valuable metric for glycemic management in the ICU.",

    "abstract": "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the gold standard for myocardial reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Numerous studies have shown that thrombus aspiration can prevent distal embolization and reducing the risk of microvascular obstruction (MVO). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is considered the gold standard for the evaluation of MVO. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thrombus aspiration in STEMI patients as an adjunctive technique to primary PCI in reducing both incidence and extent of MVO evaluated by CMR. Ninety-three patients with heavy thrombus burden were enrolled in this study; sixty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. After failed trial of restore the artery patency, aspiration thrombectomy was done followed by PCI for thirty-one patients (aspiration group), while conventional PCI without aspiration thrombectomy was performed for 34 patients (conventional group). The primary end points were both occurrence and extent of microvascular obstruction (MVO) evaluated mainly by CMR, in addition to angiographic data (MBG and TIMI flow grade). The incidence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) was significantly higher in conventional group (18 patients, 52.9 %) when compared with aspiration group (7 patients, 22.6 %; p-value = 0.012). Moreover, significant differences existed between the studied groups regarding MVO extent. For instance, MVO extended to >4 segments in only 3 patients (9.7 %) in aspiration group, but in 13 patients in conventional group (38.2 %; p-value = 0.007). Aspiration thrombectomy substantially reduces both the incidence and extent of microvascular obstruction as an adjunctive technique to PPCI in STEMI patients with heavy thrombus burden.",

    "abstract": "The Nuss procedure is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for treating pectus excavatum. Recently, its application has been extended to flail chest. A 72-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with ventricular fibrillation caused by acute myocardial infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and coronary artery stenting following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient was referred to Fukaya Red Cross Hospital owing to dyspnea caused by a flail chest following CPR. Being an elderly woman, the supporting tissues of the thorax had weakened, and she had a pronounced flail chest, a labored breathing pattern, and severe respiratory distress. Although there is the disadvantage that cardiac massage would become difficult, the cardiologist determined that cardiac function had stabilized after stent placement and that the likelihood of cardiac massage being necessary was extremely low, and therefore it was determined that repair using the Nuss method would be preferable. Two Nuss bars were inserted. Following the procedure, her respiratory condition improved, and she was discharged. Eight months later, the collapse of the anterior chest wall had resolved, and the Nuss bars were removed. However, the patient developed bilateral pneumothoraces post-removal. Thoracic drainage was performed, leading to improvement, and she was subsequently discharged. This is a rare case of using the Nuss procedure to treat flail chest following CPR. Despite the occurrence of bilateral pneumothorax after Nuss bar removal, the patient's respiratory condition significantly improved, and she had a favorable prognosis.",

To assess the efficacy and safety of Cangrelor in AMI-CS with and without CA, focusing on early stent thrombosis rates, bleeding events, and cardiovascular mortality. A total of 168 patients treated with Cangrelor for AMI-CS (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI)-SHOCK stage C or higher) with and without CA were retrospectively included. Cangrelor administration protocol included a bolus of 30 μg/kg followed by an infusion of 4 μg/kg/min for 2-4 h. The mean age was 66.3 ± 11.4 years and 75.6% (127/168) were male. CA occurred in 60.7% (102/168) of patients, with a mean time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of 21.9 ± 24.3 min. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 33.2 ± 13.1%. No cases of acute stent thrombosis or reinfarction (< 48 h) were observed. In-hospital mortality during index hospitalization occurred in 29.7% (49/168) of cases. Patients who presented with CA had a significantly higher mortality (36.3% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.002). Significant bleeding complications (BARC 3-5) were observed in 25.6% (43/168) of patients. The use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly associated with more BARC 3-5 bleeding (univariate OR 5.00; 95% CI 2.15 to 13.42; p < 0.001; multivariate p = 0.014). The mean cangrelor infusion dose was not linked to an increased bleeding risk (OR 1.00; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.00; p = 0.229). Preprocedural and discharge use of prasugrel, ticagrelor, or clopidogrel also showed no significant impact on BARC 3-5 bleeding (preprocedural p = 0.115, 0.223 and 0.831; discharge p = 0.455, 0.148 and 0.473, respectively). Following multivariate adjustment, the use of MCS, intensive care unit (ICU) duration, and reduced LVEF were the only predictors of bleeding risk (p = 0.014, 0.010, and 0.042, respectively). Cangrelor effectively prevents acute stent thrombosis and reinfarction within 48 h. Patients with MCS, longer ICU duration and reduced LVEF are at increased risk of bleeding complications. Cangrelor infusion duration per se was not associated with an increased risk of significant bleeding.",

    "title": "Cardiac Repair and Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Exploring New Frontiers in Regenerative Medicine.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, especially myocardial infarction, remain the prominent causes of death globally, necessitating the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies. Medical and surgical available treatments mainly manage disease symptoms and prevent deterioration, but do not focus on the repair of lost cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising tool for heart repair and regeneration after injury, as they possess unique properties, such as the potential for differentiation into cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells, immunomodulation, the release of mediators, and paracrine effects. This review focuses on the latest understanding of MSC therapies for cardiac repair, specifically addressing their properties, mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical studies, problems and prospects, and future strategies. MSCs can be isolated from various tissues, including bone marrow and adipose tissue, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in cardiac repair. Many preclinical studies conducted concluded that MSCs could differentiate into cardiomyocytes. MSCs involve multiple factors that enhance angiogenesis, promote the survival of existing myocardium and cardiomyocytes, reduce fibrosis, modulate the immune response, activate existing cardiac stem cells, and facilitate tissue remodeling; all of these processes are crucial in myocardial repair after MI. Although preclinical studies have promising outcomes, the application of MSC therapy in clinical trials has faced many challenges. Clinical trials conducted so far have yielded variable outcomes, with some showing marked improvements and others producing no promising results, indicating less improvement in cardiac function and mortality. This variability may be due to multiple sources, including MSCs, delivery methods, culture conditions, the timing of administration after MI, and patient-dependent factors, such as disease severity, overall patient well-being, and other comorbid conditions. The review concluded that although MSCs have a significant role in cardiac repair, further research is essential for overcoming current challenges to unlocking the maximum regenerative potential of these cells.",

    "title": "Expanding Domain-Specific Datasets with Stable Diffusion Generative Models for Simulating Myocardial Infarction.",
    "abstract": "Areas, such as the identification of human activity, have accelerated thanks to the immense development of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the lack of data is a major obstacle to even faster progress. This is particularly true in computer vision, where training a model typically requires at least tens of thousands of images. Moreover, when the activity a researcher is interested in is far from the usual, such as falls, it is difficult to have a sufficiently large dataset. An example of this could be the identification of people suffering from a heart attack. In this sense, this work proposes a novel approach that relies on generative models to extend image datasets, adapting them to generate more domain-relevant images. To this end, a refinement to stable diffusion models was performed using low-rank adaptation. A dataset of 100 images of individuals simulating infarct situations and neutral poses was created, annotated, and used. The images generated with the adapted models were evaluated using learned perceptual image patch similarity to test their closeness to the target scenario. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of synthetic datasets, and in particular the strategy proposed here, to overcome data sparsity in AI-based applications. This approach can not only be more cost-effective than building a dataset in the traditional way, but also reduces the ethical concerns of its applicability in smart environments, health monitoring, and anomaly detection. In fact, all data are owned by the researcher and can be added and modified at any time without requiring additional permissions, streamlining their research.",

This study explored SM-related genes (SMRGs) in AMI to support clinical diagnosis. We analyzed datasets GSE48060 and GSE123342 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key module genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and machine learning were used to screen potential biomarkers, which were validated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and expression assessment. Further analyses included artificial neural networks (ANN), enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, drug prediction, and molecular docking. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified key cell types and their functions. Biomarkers were validated via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Intersection of 95 DEGs and 2,196 module genes yielded 20 genes, with ANXA3 and SOCS3 identified as biomarkers. The ANN model showed superior diagnostic performance compared to individual markers. Biomarkers were enriched in the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Immune infiltration analysis revealed differences in five immune cell types between AMI and control groups. ANXA3 correlated positively with neutrophils and negatively with resting memory CD4 T cells. Drugs targeting ANXA3 included ethanolamine, difluocortolone, and fluocinolone acetonide, with strong binding affinity. scRNA-seq identified B cells and monocytes as key cells; ANXA3 and SOCS3 expression increased during monocyte differentiation before decreasing, while B cells showed no significant changes. ANXA3 and SOCS3 were identified as SM-related biomarkers in AMI, providing insights for clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to analyze and organize clinical data and mortality risk for patients with depression who were admitted with hyponatremia, using data from the Cerner Health Facts Database, to provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights for this patient population. This study employed a secondary analysis method to retrospectively analyze and statistically assess cases of hyponatremia upon admission in patients with depression from the Cerner Health Facts Database, which includes over a million hospitalized patients. We statistically analyzed data for 1,048,575 patients, among whom 81,544 (7.78%) had depression. Among these patients, 26,678 cases (32.71%) had hyponatremia ([Na] < 135 mEq/L) upon admission. Significant statistical differences were found between hyponatremic and nonhyponatremic depressed patients in terms of age, race, and Deyo-CCI grouping (all P < .001), although no difference was found in gender (P > .05). Comparisons of comorbidities showed significant differences across 14 indices, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease (all P < .05). The mortality rate was 2.65% for depressed patients with hyponatremia and 1.24% for those without, showing a significant difference (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, Deyo-CCI score, and comorbidities, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, cerebrovascular disease, hemiplegia/paraplegia, malignancy, lung cancer, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection, and hyponatremia were independent factors influencing mortality risk in depressed patients (all P < .05). The model (Model 1, 16 items) constructed with these factors had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.816 (z = 57.523, P < .001), with a sensitivity of 80.63%, specificity of 67.54%, and a Youden index of 0.482. To facilitate clinical application, we developed Model 2 (6 items), which indicated a moderate diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.773. The mortality risk for patients with depression and hyponatremia upon admission is twice as high as that for nonhyponatremic patients. This outcome is influenced by factors such as age, gender, Deyo-CCI score, and various comorbidities. It is essential to analyze the causes of hyponatremia upon admission in depressed patients and take appropriate therapeutic measures accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are a common infectious disease group, particularly with a high incidence in the elderly population. With the aging of society, the management of elderly CAP patients faces greater challenges. Elderly CAP patients are often accompanied by cardiovascular diseases, and the incidence of secondary cardiovascular events is high, severely affecting their clinical prognosis. Therefore, identifying risk factors for secondary cardiovascular events and exploring their impact on patient prognosis is of great significance for improving treatment outcomes. This study retrospectively analyzed 110 elderly CAP patients admitted from January 2023 to January 2024, divided into an event group (n = 45) and a non-event group (n = 65) based on the occurrence of secondary cardiovascular events. Basic clinical data were collected, and the relationship between advanced age, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) and secondary cardiovascular events was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of various factors on cardiovascular events, and a 12-month follow-up was conducted to evaluate their effect on clinical prognosis. The event group had significantly higher average age, smoking history, and incidence of hypertension and diabetes than the non-event group. The incidence of secondary cardiovascular events was 40.9%, with heart failure accounting for 42.2%, acute myocardial infarction for 26.7%, and arrhythmia for 31.1%. Advanced age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.88), hypertension (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.21-2.57), and diabetes (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.14-2.48) were independent risk factors for secondary cardiovascular events. The levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in the event group compared to the non-event group (P < .05). The all-cause mortality rate for the secondary cardiovascular event group was 24.4%, and the readmission rate was 37.8%, significantly higher than that of the non-event group (P < .05). The area under the curve of the multivariate regression model was 0.82, indicating good predictive ability. Advanced age, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory responses are independent risk factors for secondary cardiovascular events in elderly CAP patients, and secondary cardiovascular events significantly impact clinical prognosis. Clinical efforts should focus on identifying and intervening in high-risk factors to reduce the occurrence of secondary cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a surrogate marker for insulin resistance, has been shown to be closely associated with cardiovascular risk. However, it remains unclear whether diabetes status affects the association between the TyG index and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the relationship between the TyG index and MACEs among CHD patients with different diabetes statuses. We systematically searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to March 13, 2025, for cohort studies examining the association between TyG and MACEs in patients with CHD with different diabetes statuses. The outcomes included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and revascularization. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were extracted for the TyG index as both categorical and continuous variables. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata (version 17.0) and R (version 4.4.1). Depending on heterogeneity, either a fixed-effect or random-effects model was used to pool the data. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression are used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD: 420251018545). A total of 36 longitudinal cohort studies comprising 173,851 participants (119,232 with diabetes and 54,619 without diabetes) were included, with 9159 MACEs reported during the follow-up period. In diabetic patients, a higher TyG index significantly increased the risk of MACEs (categorical HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.61-2.43; continuous HR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.38-1.78), all-cause mortality (HR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.45-2.08), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.52-2.77), nonfatal stroke (HR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.12-2.66), and revascularization (HR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.26-5.04). In nondiabetic patients, a higher TyG index also significantly increased the risk of MACEs (categorical HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.33-2.05; continuous HR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.46-2.06), all-cause mortality (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.18-1.90), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.11-5.47), and revascularization (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.57-2.76). However, no association was observed between the TyG index and nonfatal stroke (HR = 1.66, 95% CI 0.88-3.12) in nondiabetic patients. Higher TyG index values appear to be associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with CHD. However, no significant association was found between the TyG index and the risk of nonfatal stroke in nondiabetic patients. These findings suggest that the TyG index may offer potential prognostic value in CHD, but further high-quality prospective studies are warranted to confirm these associations and clarify their clinical implications.",

Primary outcome was the time from hospital admission to ICA and PCI in patients admitted to PCI and non-PCI centres. Secondary analyses included the time from ICA to PCI and variation among individual PCI centres. A total of 36,573 NSTEMI patients (median age 68 years, 30% female) were included in the analysis. 24,857 patients (68%) were admitted to a hospital with PCI facilities (n = 30) and 11,716 patients (32%) to a hospital without PCI on site (n = 42).

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate these rates. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science (inception to March 2025) for studies reporting MI incidence or mortality after HNC treatment. A random-effects meta-analysis yielded pooled proportions. Subgroup analyses examined variations by treatment modality, time period (pre-/post-2010), and geography. Of 680 studies, 53 were included, encompassing 85,948 patients with HNC. The global pooled MI incidence was 1.7% (95% CI 1.2-2.3%), decreasing from 2.6% (pre-2010) to 1.5% (post-2010). Incidence was lowest with upfront surgery alone (1.2%) and higher with surgery plus adjuvant therapy (2.7%), primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (2.3%), radiotherapy (RT) alone (2.4%), or chemotherapy (CT) alone (2.1%). Global pooled MI mortality was 42.1% (95% CI 15.3-74.6%), declining from 49.8% (pre-2010) to 36.0% (post-2010). Male sex (p = 0.01) and longer follow-up in the RT group (p = 0.01) were associated with higher MI incidence via meta-regression; longer follow-up was also linked to higher mortality (p = 0.028). This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD420251040579) estimated the global MI incidence post-HNC treatment to be 1.7%, with the lowest after surgery alone and no significant geographic variation. MI mortality is high (42.1%) but has decreased over time. These findings demonstrate significant cardiovascular burden associated with HNC treatment, particularly non-surgical modalities, highlighting the need for targeted cardiovascular surveillance strategies.",

Elderly patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HF were enrolled in the present study. We detected the concentration of serum SFRP2 in these patients. The primary endpoint of this study was defined as all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and readmission due to HF, acute myocardial infarction, and malignant arrhythmia during a median follow-up period of 450 (interquartile range 224-942) days. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of SFRP2. Of 161 patients at baseline, we observed 72 events (25 deaths and 47 readmissions). Serum SFRP2 levels were significantly elevated in elderly HF patients with events relative to those without and control subjects (all P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular readmissions stratified by the optimal cut-off value of serum SFRP2 level (log-rank P < 0.005). An elevated SFRP2 level and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was independently and significantly associated with the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.334, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.059-5.147;P = 0.036 and HR 2.326, 95% CI 1.426-3.794;P = 0.001, respectively) in multivariable Cox regression analysis. A higher level of serum SFRP2 can be considered as an independent predictor of poorer clinical outcomes for elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, indicating that evaluation of SFRP2 could provide more useful information for the long-term prognosis in these patients beyond NT-proBNP.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-documented risk factor for major adverse cardiac events and bleeding events. The optimal antiplatelet strategy for patients with CKD remains unclear, especially patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min. We aim to compare clinical outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and CKD treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel vs. clopidogrel. Patients were collected from the acute coronary syndrome Israeli survey (ACSIS). Patients were divided into 2 groups: ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI. Each group was further divided based on the GFR value (<30 ml/min or ≥ 30 ml/min). Mortality, bleeding, repeat revascularization, and re-hospitalization at 30-day and 1-year were evaluated. A total of 5,442 patients were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences regarding baseline characteristics between both groups of ACS patients. In patients with STEMI and GFR < 30 ml/min, re-hospitalization (32% vs. 29 % p = 1.0), bleeding (2.7% vs 2.3% p = 0.9), and death rates (8.1 % vs 2.3% p = 0.5) did not differ between the two different treatment strategies at 30-day follow-up. The mortality rate in 1-year was lower among STEMI patients treated with the ticagrelor or prasugrel as compared with clopidogrel (33% vs 11% p = 0.04). In patients with ACS and CKD, rehospitalization, bleeding and mortality rates were similar in30 days in patients treated with ticagrelor/prasugrel versus clopidogrel. Nevertheless, in patients presenting with STEMI and GFR < 30 ml/min, treatment with ticagrelor/prasugrel was correlated with a lower 1-year mortality rate as compared with clopidogrel treatment with no increase in bleeding rates. 1. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC: •Potent antiplatelet therapy is the current standard of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), however the optimal antiplatelet strategy for patients with chronic kidney diseaseany difference in the sub analysis for either remains unclear, especially patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min. 2. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADDS: In patients with advanced CKD and STEMI treatment with potent antiplatelet regimen was associated with a lower 1 year mortality rate.Our finding, including mortality, ischemic and bleeding event,adds additional information about the optimal antiplatelet therapy in patients with advanced CKD diagnosed with ACS.",

    "abstract": "Elevation in serum troponin following elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is indicative of post-PCI troponin increase (pTI) and is associated with higher mortality rates. In this analysis, we sought to identify clinical and angiographic risk factors for pTI. Consecutive patients undergoing elective PCI with drug-eluting stent implantation at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA, between 2012 and 2022 were retrospectively analysed. Patients with elevated baseline troponin (>1× upper reference limit (URL)) and missing baseline or post-PCI troponin values were excluded. pTI was defined according to the cut-offs established by the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI, ≥5× URL) and the Academic Research Consortium 2 (ARC-2) definition (≥35× URL). Predictors of pTI were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression with stepwise selection of candidate covariates. Of the 10 592 included patients, 16.3% had pTI by UDMI criteria and 4.4% by ARC-2 criteria. Predictors of pTI for both definitions included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lesion length and maximum stent diameter, while higher left ventricular ejection fraction, prior PCI and intravascular imaging use had a protective effect. Female sex, anaemia and P2Y12 inhibitor loading (as opposed to chronic therapy) predicted UDMI-defined pTI but not ARC-2-defined pTI, whereas chronic kidney disease predicted only ARC-2-defined pTI. In conclusion, there are patient-specific angiographic and clinical risk factors that can predict pTI. These risk factors should be considered in formulating more individualised risk assessment for those undergoing elective PCI.",

    "abstract": "The impact of milk consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk or mortality is unclear, and specific comparisons between types of milk are scarce. We aimed to investigate the associations between milk consumption, measured in a large Norwegian cohort in 3 counties during 1974-1988, and CVD-related mortality and all-cause mortality and to compare the associations between whole (full-fat) and low-fat milk. This population-based, prospective cohort study included adults invited to repeated health screenings in the Norwegian Counties Study (>80% attendance). Dietary intake was assessed from food frequency questionnaires at each screening in 1974-1988. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for the associations between milk intake (assessed as cumulative mean intake from repeated questionnaires) and risk of death from all CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and all causes. Among 73,860 participants included in this study (mean age: 41.2 years at baseline; 49% females), 26,393 deaths occurred (8590 from CVD, 4372 from IHD, and 3047 from AMI) during a median follow-up of 33 y. Comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of overall milk intake, the HR was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.21) for CVD-related mortality and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.28) for all-cause mortality. For whole milk, high compared with no intake was positively associated with CVD (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.16), IHD (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.27), and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.21). Compared with whole milk, low-fat milk intake was associated with lower CVD-related, IHD-related, AMI-related, and all-cause mortality. The associations were attenuated in analyses considering only baseline intakes. In this cohort with high milk consumption, whole milk is associated with higher CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas low-fat milk is not. Low-fat milk may be associated with lower risks than whole milk.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is frequent in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and debulking-techniques including rotational atherectomy (RA) are frequently used for enhanced lesion preparation prior to stent implantation. To date, long-term clinical outcomes of patients with CAC undergoing RA are scant. This study evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of RA for lesion preparation of calcified coronary lesions at 3 years. Consecutive patients undergoing RA at the German heart center Munich were included in this registry. Clinical endpoints were the incidence of death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization (TLR) and probable or definite stent thrombosis (ST) at 30 days, 1 year and 3 years. 632 patients with 964 lesions undergoing RA were included in this analysis. The mean age was 74.8 ± 8.6 years and 36.2 % were diabetic. 98.9 % of lesions had severe or moderate calcification and 16.5 % were chronic total occlusion lesions. The cumulative incidence of clinical endpoints at 30 days was: 3.6 % death, 1.3 % MI, 0.8 % TLR and 2.2 % definite or probable ST. The incidence for mid- to long-term outcomes at 1 and 3 years were: 10.2 % and 21.7 % death, 1.4 % and 1.6 % MI, 10.8 % and 13.0 % TLR; 2.5 % and 2.7 % definite or probable ST. In this large retrospective analysis of patients undergoing RA for lesion preparation in calcified lesions rates of thrombotic events are high, mostly occur within the first 30 days. Long-term mortality and revascularization rates remain considerable, likely reflecting the high-risk lesion and patient characteristics of this cohort.",

In this retrospective cohort study utilizing the TriNetX network, we analyzed data from hospitalized STEMI patients who underwent PCI between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023, stratifying them based on the use of adjunctive thrombectomy. Out of 50,104 patients, 1,967 (3.9%) underwent thrombectomy. After 1:1 propensity score matching to adjust for baseline differences, we found no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.212; 95% CI: 1.044 to 1.406) or stroke risk (HR: 0.865; 95% CI: 0.400 to 1.870) between the thrombectomy and nonthrombectomy groups. However, patients in the thrombectomy group experienced higher rates of heart failure (HF) readmissions and blood transfusion requirements at 1 year. These findings suggest that while adjunctive thrombectomy does not appear to increase the risk of mortality or stroke, its association with adverse clinical outcomes such as HF and transfusion needs indicates that its use should be reserved for carefully selected patients, particularly those with a high thrombus burden. Further prospective studies are necessary to clarify its role and determine the patient populations most likely to benefit.",

Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for incident MACE and other CVD events in those with compared to those without PVFx. Adjusted for age and sex, those with PVFx had HR for incident MACE of 1.34 (95 % C·I. 1.19, 1.51), hospitalization for myocardial infarction (HR 1.35, 95 % C.I. 1.02, 1.79), all-cause mortality (HR 1.36, 95 % C.I, 1.19, 1.56), and other CVD events (HR 1.40, 95 % C.I. 1.21, 1.61).

    "abstract": "Aim Reduced kidney function is a known risk amplifier for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and adverse kidney events. Accurate assessment of kidney function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is therefore essential for evaluating ASCVD risk and kidney prognosis. We aimed to compare the revised 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) [2021-eGFRcr(AS)] and European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFCcr) with the 2009 CKD-EPI [2009-eGFRcr(ASR)] equations in predicting the risk of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort. Methods This was a multi-centre, retrospective cohort study of adults who attended the ambulatory clinics in the Singapore General Hospital and SingHealth Polyclinics. Individuals were included if they had at least one serum creatinine and albuminuria result in 2014 and at least one follow-up visit between 2015 and 2018. Demographic data, comorbidities, biochemistry and hospitalizations were retrieved from electronic medical records. eGFR was calculated using the 2009-eGFRcr(ASR) and 2021-eGFRcr(AS), and EKFCcr equations. Multivariable logistic regression models for the associations between eGFR categories and hospitalizations for AMI, AKD and CKD were evaluated for their goodness-of-fit and discrimination. Results Among 10,137 individuals in the study, the mean age was 65.5 (10.8) years. The mean eGFRs were 85.6 (20.4), 89.3 (20.0) and 79.6 (19.5) ml/min/1.73 m2 according to the 2009-eGFRcr(ASR), 2021-eGFRcr(AS) and EKFCcr equations, respectively. Compared to the 2009-eGFRcr(ASR) equation, 28.8-33.3%of individuals were reclassified to a less severe eGFR category by the 2021-eGFRcr(AS) equation, while 1.6%-36.6% were reclassified to a more severe eGFR category by the EKFCcr equation. Over a mean follow up of 44.9 (12.6) months, hospitalisations for AMI, AKD and CKD occurred in 42 (0.4%), 228 (2.4%) and 189 (2.0%) of patients respectively. More severe eGFR categories were independently associated with all the outcomes. For hospitalisation for CKD, the model with the 2021-eGFRcr(AS) equation had significantly better discrimination (AUC difference +0.010 (p = 0.016) and better fit (Vuong Z statistic =-2.175, p = 0.015) compared to the model with the 2009-eGFR(ASR). However, the discrimination and fit of models for predicting AMI and AKI hospitalisations were similar between 2021-eGFRcr(AS) and 2009-eGFR(ASR) equations were similar. The EKFCcr-based models did demonstrate improved discrimination or fit for hospitalisation for AMI, AKD and CKD, compared to 2009-eGFRcr(ASR) model. Conclusion Lower eGFR ascertained by the 2009-eGFRcr(ASR), 2021-eGFRcr(AS) and EKFCcr equations were independently associated with greater risks of hospitalization for cardiovascular and kidney disease in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort. Adoption of the race-free 2021-eGFRcr(AS) equation improved prediction of hospitalization for CKD compared to the 2009-eGFRcr(ASR, and was non-inferior in predicting hospitalisation for AMI and AKD. These findings, support the use of the 2021-eGFRcr(AS) equation in clinical practice, to predict health service utilisation for hospitalizations for cardiovascular and kidney disease, aligning with global initiatives for race-neutral kidney function evaluation.",

This study aims to evaluate whether statins decrease major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among CAD phenotypes according to severity, vulnerability and extent categorized by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The authors analyzed consecutive patients who were referred for coronary CTA at a tertiary center for the assessment of chronic coronary syndrome. The primary endpoint was MACE defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, or revascularization for unstable angina. Statin use was defined as annualized days on statin therapy (days on statin based on redeemed prescriptions, divided by follow-up time), and analyzed for each 10% increase in statin use over the follow-up period. Interaction analysis, adjusting for risk factors was applied to define treatment benefit across CAD phenotypes. Overall, 11,026 individuals (mean age: 58.6 ± 11.9 years, 54.7% male) were analyzed who underwent coronary CTA between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. A 10% increase in statin use was associated with lower risk for MACE the stratified Cox-regression model in patients with CAD (adjusted HR [aHR]: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.99]; P = 0.006), but not in patients without CAD (aHR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.84-1.07]; P = 0.370). In the total population using interaction analysis including CAD phenotypes, a 10% increase in statin use decreased the risk for MACE in the presence of obstructive CAD (aHR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.85-0.97]; P = 0.006), high-risk plaque (aHR: 0.82 [95% CI: 0.68-0.98]; P = 0.026), calcium score of ≥400 (aHR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.87-0.99]; P = 0.024), and segment involvement score of >4 (aHR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.84-0.95]; P < 0.001), but not for any CAD (aHR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.85-1.07]; P = 0.411). Statin efficacy to decrease MACE depends on CAD phenotypes and increases with the extent and severity of disease and in the presence of high-risk plaques. Patients without CAD have no benefit from statin therapy regarding MACE. Coronary CTA may play a pivotal role in optimizing statin allocation for personalized treatment decisions to prevent MACE.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of underweight and dementia on in-hospital mortality in AMI patients using a nationwide administrative database. This nationwide retrospective cohort study was performed using the Japanese nationwide administrative data (JROAD-DPC) of 474,979 AMI patients between April 2012 and March 2021. Of these patients, 424,500 with AMI were divided into four groups according to body mass index (<18.5 kg/m² or ≥18.5 kg/m²) and dementia status (presence or absence). We investigated the association of underweight and dementia with in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality was highest in the underweight/dementia group (17.5%), followed by the non-underweight/dementia group (13.2%), the underweight/non-dementia group (11.6%), and lowest in the non-underweight/non-dementia group (5.0%). Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis with multiple imputation and complete cases showed underweight and dementia to be associated alone and in combination with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. In the subgroup analysis of age categories (<75 vs ≥75 years), the synergistic effects of underweight and dementia on in-hospital mortality for AMI were greater for those <75 years of age. This nationwide study suggested that the coexistence of underweight and dementia significantly increases the risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients and especially younger patients. Early detection and management of both conditions may be crucial for improving survival in this population.",

In this study, we developed explainable machine learning models to predict the overall survival (OS) of STEMI patients to help improve prognosis and increase survival. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected 893 patients who underwent emergency coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI at the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. The best predictor variables were screened by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. These variables were used to construct Cox proportional hazards regression (coxph) and random survival forest (rfsrc) models. Three criteria (C-index, Brier score, and C/D AUC) were utilised to compare the performance of the two models. Then, by applying the time-dependent variable importance and the partial dependence survival profile, a global explanation of the entire cohort was conducted. Finally, local explanations for individual patients were performed with the SurvSHAP(t) and SurvLIME plots and the ceteris paribus survival profile. Combining the results of the comparison of the three criteria, the performance of the rfsrc model was shown to be superior to that of the coxph model. LASSO regression was used to screen 11 predictor variables, such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Killip class, hyperlipidaemia, global registry of acute coronary events (GRACE) Score, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB, myoglobin, white blood cells, monocytes, thrombin time, globulin (GLB), and conjugated bilirubin. The global explanation of the whole cohort revealed that DBP, GRACE Score, myoglobin, and monocytes had a significant effect on the OS of STEMI patients in the coxph model and that DBP, GRACE Score, and GLB were the variables that significantly affected the OS of STEMI patients in the rfsrc model. Incorporating a single patient into the model can yield a local explanation of each patient, thus guiding clinicians in developing precision treatments. The rfsrc model outperformed the coxph model in terms of predictive performance. Clinicians can use these predictive models to understand the major risk factors for each STEMI patient and thus develop more individualised and precise treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In structurally normal hearts, premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are primarily driven by enhanced automaticity or afterdepolarization-dependent triggered activity. Traditionally, re-entrant excitation has only been associated with cardiac conditions involving scar formation, such as post-myocardial infarction or cardiac sarcoidosis. We present a case of an asymptomatic 28-year-old patient with a high burden of monomorphic PVCs originating near the posteromedial papillary muscle. Left ventricular (LV) dilatation with reduced systolic function (ejection fraction 45%) was diagnosed as PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, given the absence of fibrosis and coronary artery disease. During an electrophysiological study, a 2-cm2 region was identified where abnormal Purkinje potentials (P1), exhibiting markedly reduced conduction velocity (0.88 mm/ms), consistently followed the rapid conduction via the left posterior fascicle (LPF). Local activation time velocity vectors of P1 pinpointed the earliest abnormal Purkinje activation at the proximal LPF. The impulse excited the distal one-third of the interventricular septum before conducting retrogradely to the LPF. Radiofrequency ablation targeted at the Purkinje-myocardial pivot point successfully eliminated the PVCs, restoring LV systolic function at follow-up. Even in the absence of structural heart disease, delayed anterograde Purkinje conduction can facilitate monomorphic PVCs via re-excitation. This highlights the potential for targeted ablation at the distal Purkinje network as an effective treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 82 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who underwent coronary angiography in the Department of Cardiology at Shigatse People's Hospital between December 2020 and December 2021. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of coronary angiography: the myocardial infarction associated with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD group, n = 67) and the MINOCA group (n = 15). Etiology, medical history, laboratory findings, and in-hospital adverse events were analyzed for the MINOCA group. Among the 15 MINOCA patients, the primary etiologies included: coronary plaque rupture in 2 cases (13.33%), coronary artery spasm in 2 cases (13.33%), coronary thrombosis or embolism in 1 case (6.67%), type 2 AMI in 1 case (6.67%), unrecognized myocarditis in 3 cases (20%), and other unknown causes in 6 cases. Compared with the MI-CAD group, MINOCA patients had a significantly lower BMI (p < 0.05). Laboratory findings revealed that LDL-C, apolipoprotein A, hs-cTnI, and CK-MB levels were significantly lower in the MINOCA group compared to the MI-CAD group (p < 0.01). Electrocardiogram results showed lower proportions of T-wave changes and ST-segment elevation in the MINOCA group than in the MI-CAD group (p < 0.05). Echocardiography findings indicated that MI-CAD patients were more prone to wall motion abnormalities (p < 0.001) and had significantly thicker interventricular septa compared to the MINOCA group (p < 0.05). Due to factors such as hypoxic environments and different lifestyles, MINOCA in the plateau region exhibits characteristics distinct from those observed in low-altitude regions. Enhanced follow-up of these patients is recommended. Further exploration of the mechanisms underlying MINOCA in high-altitude environments is warranted to provide a basis for disease prevention and the development of individualized treatment strategies.",

After myocardial infarction, several waves of inflammatory cells play a crucial role in infarct size and cardiac remodeling. In the short and long term, subtypes of inflammatory cells and cytokines released orchestrate the healing and stability of coronary disease. In recent years, some anti-inflammatory therapies have been shown to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, some medications for treating risk factors and adoption of healthy lifestyle have decreased inflammatory markers and cardiovascular outcomes. In this complex network of possibilities, multiple interventions and not just on specific cell type or cytokine may provide better results. Finally, mild or moderate inflammatory activity appears necessary for better recovery and survival after acute myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Side branch occlusion (SBO) remains a prevalent and clinically significant complication during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for bifurcation lesions, particularly those involving the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. This retrospective study aimed to assess the incidence, identify independent predictors, and evaluate the clinical consequences of SBO in the context of LAD bifurcation PCI. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 553 patients who underwent PCI targeting LAD bifurcation lesions between 2018 and 2023. Comprehensive data encompassing clinical characteristics, angiographic findings, and procedural details were collected. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SBO, defined as a reduction in side branch TIMI flow following stent implantation. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine independent risk factors. SBO occurred in 41 cases (7.4%). Multivariate analysis identified true bifurcation lesions (OR 1.221, P < 0.001), an increased main vessel to side branch (MV/SB) diameter ratio (OR 1.431, P < 0.001), and higher Visual estimation-based Risk prEdiction of Side branch OccLusion in coronary bifurcation interVEntion (V-RESOLVE) scores (OR 3.736, P = 0.001) as significant independent predictors. Patients with SBO showed reduced procedural success rates (82.9% vs. 94.7%, P = 0.007), a higher incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction (14.6% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.003), and increased rates of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (17.1% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.007). SBO is a clinically impactful yet partially preventable event in LAD bifurcation PCI. Key contributors include anatomical complexity, suboptimal protection strategies, and underutilization of intracoronary imaging. The V-RESOLVE score proved to be a robust predictor and may serve as a valuable tool for pre-procedural risk stratification, facilitating more tailored and effective intervention strategies.",

    "title": "Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 promotes serine synthesis pathway and cardiac repair after myocardial infarction.",
    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: The permanent loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) following myocardial infarction (MI), coupled with the heart's limited regenerative capacity, often leads to heart failure. Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) is a protein highly expressed in the embryonic mouse heart but markedly downregulated after birth. Despite its presence in early cardiac development, PSAT1's role in CM proliferation, cardiac physiology, and repair remains unexplored. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of PSAT1-modified mRNA (modRNA) for promoting cardiac repair and improving outcomes post-MI. Methods: Synthetic PSAT1-modRNA was delivered to the hearts of mice post-MI. The study evaluated its effects on CM proliferation and death, scar formation, angiogenesis, and cardiac function. Molecular mechanisms underlying PSAT1's actions were explored, including its regulation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP), oxidative stress, nucleotide synthesis, and interactions with the YAP1-β-catenin molecular axis. Additionally, SSP inhibition studies were conducted to determine its contribution to CM cell cycle activity and apoptosis. Results: PSAT1 is downregulated during mouse heart development. Cardiac delivery of PSAT1-modRNA induced significant CM proliferation, reduced scar size, and enhanced angiogenesis. Functional analyses revealed improved cardiac performance and survival in PSAT1 injected mice post-MI. Mechanistically, PSAT1 induces the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) in CMs, resulting in increased nucleotide synthesis and reduced oxidative stress, thereby supporting CM proliferation and survival. Conversely, SSP inhibition suppressed CM cell cycle activity and triggered apoptosis post-MI. Furthermore, PSAT1 modRNA inhibited CM apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage. At the molecular level, YAP1 transactivated PSAT1, and PSAT1 induced β-catenin nuclear translocation, and is indispensable for YAP1-induced CM proliferation. Conclusions: PSAT1 emerges as a pleiotropic gene critical for favorable cardiac remodeling post-MI through multiple mechanisms, including CM proliferation, SSP activation, inhibition of oxidative stress and cell death, and YAP1-β-catenin pathway modulation. These findings highlight PSAT1's potential as a novel therapeutic target for mRNA-based treatments in ischemic heart diseases, offering a promising avenue for clinical application in cardiac repair.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies was to evaluate the relationship between FXI and the risk of cardiovascular events. FXI levels in the general population and the risk of different cardiovascular events were the primary exposure and outcome, respectively. Two independent reviewers (Li and Ma) screened all available literature to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. A random or fixed-effects model was used, and heterogeneity was quantitatively tested by the I 2 statistic. A total of 16 original studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results of both case-control and cohort studies showed a positive correlation between FXI levels and the risk of cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.17-2.68; hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.64).

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of autologous stem cells in the treatment of post-infarction myocardial changes. Statistical, bibliographic, and bibliosemantic research methods and scientific literature for the last 6 years were used to achieve the purpose. Cardiovascular diseases hold the highest prevalence and mortality rates, second only to the number of accidents. Today, there are many methods in the fight against coronary heart disease. However, drug therapy is the least effective, and instrumental methods are too invasive and entail several complications and side effects. Therefore, conducting detailed research on the impact of stem cells on the myocardium affected by infarction presents a challenge. Stem cell transplantation, which includes autologous bone marrow stem cells, typically leads to noticeable and significant changes in cardiac hemodynamic parameters and rheological properties. The development of autologous bone marrow stem cells during the angiogenesis process substantiates such metamorphoses. In addition, factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and the whole list of coagulogram indicators may influence these changes. The practical significance of the raised subject is using stem cell therapy as an alternative, less invasive method in the fight against postinfarction myocardial changes.",

Hence, we aimed to determine the incidence, type of surgery, timing and perioperative outcomes of individuals undergoing elective NCS after TAVI. Hospitalizations for TAVI were identified from the US National Readmission Database between 2012 and 2021, and patients who received NCS within six months were included for analysis. Incidence, type, and timing of planned readmissions for NCS were evaluated according to the surgical risk as low, intermediate, and high. The primary outcome was the occurrence of an in-hospital major adverse events (MAE) defined as the composite of death, cardiac complications, and stroke/transient ischemic attack. Multivariable regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with MAE. Out of 502,775 TAVI procedures, 2,390 (0.48%) patients were electively readmitted within 6 months after TAVI for NCS. Surgeries were classified as low- (n=321, 13.4%), intermediate- (n=1522, 63.7%), and high-risk (n=547, 22.9%). The median age of the study population was 78 years (IQR 73-84) with 59% of participants being male. Overall surgeries occurred at a median of 83 days (IQR 48-120) after the index TAVI procedure, a time-period which was significantly shorter for those who underwent high-risk surgeries (median 67, IQR 41-109 days, P<0.001). The overall rate of post-operative MAE was 7.6% (n=181), and these rates did not differ between surgical-risk groups (P=0.46). The primary outcome was driven primarily by cardiac complications (3.6%), while rates of death were low and almost identical between surgical-risk groups (P=0.99). Factors independently associated with the primary outcome were congestive heart failure (aOR: 1.62, CI: 1.23-2.12, P<0.001), liver disease (aOR: 2.17, CI:1.37-3.45, P=0.001), diabetes mellitus (aOR: 1.44, CI: 1.13-1.82, P=0.003), cancer (aOR: 1.18, CI: 0.92-1.50, P<0.001), and time to readmission (aOR: 1.00, CI:0.99-1.00, P=0.004). Elective NCS occurred infrequently post TAVI and was associated with low rates of mortality. While diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, liver disease, cancer, anemia, and time to readmission were associated with postprocedural adverse events, the surgical risk was not. The risk of NCS after TAVI should be balanced against the risk of delaying an operation.",

DNMT3A and TET2 are the 2 most prevalent clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential-associated driver genes. This study aims to evaluate their effects on plaque characteristics and prognosis in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Consecutive patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (May 2017-May 2019) undergoing routine optical coherence tomography were enrolled. Targeted deep exome sequencing of peripheral blood (custom panel targeting DNMT3A and TET2) identified mutations (with a threshold variant allele frequency ≥2%). The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as a composite end point that includes all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and revascularization due to clinical ischemic events. Among 628 patients, 12.3% were identified as carriers of DNMT3A or TET2 gene mutations. Patients with DNMT3A/TET2 mutations were older (62.5 versus 55.6 years; P<0.001), while the 2 groups showed comparable prevalence rates of hypertension (48.1% versus 43.2%), diabetes (22.1% versus 22.3%), and dyslipidemia (53.2% versus 61.7%). Carriers demonstrated greater plaque vulnerability characteristics on optical coherence tomography, including a higher macrophage proportion, smaller minimal lumen area, thinner fibrous cap, and higher lipid index. During a median follow-up of 2.4 years (IQR, 2.0-3.0), major adverse cardiovascular events rates were significantly higher in the mutation group (39.5% versus 19.9%; P<0.001).

Clinical studies comparing MSC therapy with control treatments for AMI were identified from databases including Cochrane, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang, covering publications up to August 2024. Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software. MSC treatment significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared to controls at follow-up intervals <6 months (MD = 3.42; P < 0.0001), 6 months (MD = 4.15; P = 0.006), and 12 months (MD = 2.77; P = 0.006). However, no significant effect on LVEF was observed after 12 months (MD = 3.50; P = 0.17). MSC therapy did not significantly affect left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) at any interval. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) significantly decreased only within the first 6 months (MD = -11.35; P = 0.11) but not at subsequent follow-ups. Wall motion score index (WMSI) significantly improved at <6 months (MD = -0.06; P < 0.0001), 6 months (MD = -0.04; P = 0.006), and >12 months (MD = -0.03; P = 0.02). However, the improvement at 12 months was borderline significant (MD = -0.06; P = 0.06). MSC therapy showed no significant reduction in MACE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61; P = 0.10). Subgroup analyses indicated intracoronary MSC administration notably improved LVEF (MD = 4.27; P < 0.0001), while intravenous MSC administration showed no significant effect. Neither administration route significantly affected MACE outcomes. No publication bias was detected. In conclusion, MSC therapy significantly enhances LVEF and WMSI within the first 12 months post-AMI, with intracoronary administration showing greater efficacy than intravenous delivery. However, MSC treatment did not significantly reduce MACE incidence. Further rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "title": "[Risk assessment of perioperative adverse events and management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with bladder cancer and coronary atherosclerotic heart disease undergoing transurethral resection of bladder cancer].",
    "abstract": "To explore the risk factors of adverse events during the perioperative period of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in bladder cancer patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD). We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of bladder cancer patients who underwent TURBT in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from June 2022 to September 2024. All patients with bladder cancer and CAD underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for diagnosis and assessment of CAD before surgery. Based on the CCTA results, the patients with bladder cancer and CAD were divided into two groups: those with mild to moderate coronary stenosis and those with severe coronary stenosis. The severe coronary stenosis group was further divided into two subgroups based on whether they received low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy or continued their antiplatelet treatment before surgery. Perioperative anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies were adjusted according to the opinions of the specialists. The incidence of adverse events within 30 days postoperatively was followed up and analyzed. A total of 80 bladder cancer patients with CAD who underwent TURBT were included in the study. Among the 80 patients with CAD, 55 (68.8%) had mild to moderate coronary stenosis, and 25 (31.2%) had severe coronary stenosis. Compared with those had mild to moderate coronary stenosis, the patients who had severe coronary stenosis had a higher incidence of postoperative bleeding and pulmonary embolism, although the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). However, the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction was significantly higher in the patients who had severe coronary stenosis (P=0.034). Among the patients with severe coronary stenosis, 8 (32.0%) received LMWH bridging therapy before TURBT, and 17 (68.0%) continued their previous antiplatelet treatment. Compared with those who continued antiplatelet treatment, the patients who received LMWH bridging therapy had a higher incidence of postoperative bleeding and pulmonary embo-lism, although the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). However, the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction was significantly higher in the LMWH bridging group (P=0.032). Patients with mild-to-moderate coronary stenosis demonstrate relatively low perioperative risk during TURBT procedures and may safely undergo TURBT following antiplatelet therapy discontinuation. Conversely, those with severe coronary stenosis exhibit significantly higher perioperative risk and require intensive monitoring. In bladder cancer patients with concomitant severe coronary stenosis, perioperative LMWH bridging therapy is associated with increased myocardial infarction risk, whereas continued antiplatelet therapy does not elevate postoperative bleeding risk. Current evidence therefore supports maintaining antiplatelet therapy in these patients, with appropriate bleeding risk assessment. 探讨合并冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病(coronary atherosclerotic heart disease，CAD)的膀胱癌患者行经尿道膀胱肿瘤切除术(transurethral resection of bladder tumor，TURBT)围手术期的不良事件风险因素。 选择北京安贞医院2022年6月至2024年9月行TURBT手术治疗的膀胱癌患者的病例资料进行回顾性分析，所有合并CAD的患者术前均行冠状动脉计算机断层扫描(coronary computed tomography angiography, CCTA)，根据CCTA诊断和评估结果，将合并CAD的膀胱癌患者分为冠状动脉轻中度狭窄组和冠状动脉重度狭窄组。根据术前维持抗血小板治疗或进行低分子肝素(low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH)桥接治疗，再将冠状动脉重度狭窄组分为两个亚组。术前根据心内科医生意见，调整围手术期抗凝和抗血小板药物的管理策略，随访术后30 d内患者不良事件发生率并分析其发生原因。 研究共纳入80例符合标准的膀胱癌合并CAD进行TURBT的患者，冠状动脉轻中度狭窄组患者55例(68.8%)，冠状动脉重度狭窄组患者25例(31.2%)。与冠状动脉轻中度狭窄组相比，冠状动脉重度狭窄组患者出现了术后出血以及肺栓塞，但组间差异无统计学意义(P>0.05)，而冠状动脉重度狭窄组患者术后心肌梗死发生率显著增多(P=0.034)。在冠状动脉重度狭窄组患者中，有8例(32.0%)患者进行了TURBT术前LMWH桥接治疗，17例(68.0%)患者维持抗血小板治疗。与维持抗血小板治疗亚组相比，术前LMWH桥接治疗亚组出现了术后出血及肺栓塞，但两亚组间差异无统计学意义(P>0.05), 而术后发生心肌梗死的患者显著增多(P=0.032)。 冠状动脉轻中度狭窄患者进行TURBT的围手术期不良事件风险较低，可在停用抗血小板药物治疗后安全地进行TURBT治疗；而冠状动脉重度狭窄的患者围手术期发生不良事件的风险较高，需要严密监测。对于合并冠状动脉重度狭窄的膀胱癌患者，在TURBT术前LMWH桥接治疗发生心肌梗死的风险较高，且维持抗血小板治疗不会增加术后出血风险，建议在平衡出血风险的前提下，维持抗血小板药物的治疗。",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) during the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, a complex cellular transdifferentiation process closely associated with increased oxidative stress under adverse conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). Decursin, a major constituent of Angelica gigas Nakai, displays diverse pharmacological properties. This study aimed to examine the antioxidant impact of decursin on EndMT regulation in both in vitro and in vivo models as a potential therapeutic strategy for MI. In vitro the inhibitory effects of decursin treatment were analyzed by measuring the expression of EndMT-associated genes, assessing endothelial function, intracellular ROS levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, the study elucidated antioxidation-related signaling mechanisms within EndMT-induced ECs. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of decursin was investigated using a mouse model of MI. Decursin administration attenuated the EndMT process by upregulating CD31 and VE-Cadherin while decreasing fibronectin and α-SMA expression in EndMT-induced ECs. It also lowered ROS levels, preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, and modulated functional properties, resulting in enhanced LDL uptake and diminished endothelial permeability. Endothelial integrity was sustained via regulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and Smad-dependent signaling pathways, both responsive to oxidative stress during EndMT. In the MI mouse model, decursin reversed EndMT, lessened myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis, and promoted recovery of infarcted regions. The treated hearts demonstrated improved cardiovascular performance. Decursin represents a novel therapeutic strategy targeting intracellular oxidative stress induced by EndMT. By exerting antioxidant activity through the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and Smaddependent pathways, decursin maintains endothelial function, suppresses myocardial fibrosis, and supports cardiac recovery following MI therapy.",

    "abstract": "The association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cerebrovascular events and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is less explored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PFO closure versus non-closure on the risk of MACE and cerebrovascular events in patients with or without a CVA history. This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with PFO who were younger than 60 years old and referred to the Professor Kojuri Cardiovascular Clinic between 2010 and 2023. Patients were interviewed for the occurrence of MACEs post-diagnosis or closure. The MACE components consisted of myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA/TIA), decompensated heart failure (DHF), and cardiac death. Among 122 participants with prior CVA, MACE incidence was seen at 13 (10.6%), including eight new CVAs (6.6%), three new MI events (2.5%), and two new cases of acute DHF (1.6%). No significant differences in MACE incidence rates were found between PFO closure and non-closure groups (p = 0.430), nor in new CVA occurrences (p = 0.479). Among 58 patients without prior CVA, MACE incidence was five (8.6%), including two new MIs (3.4%), two new cases of acute DHF (3.4%), and one new CVA (1.7%). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in MACE rates (p = 0.192) or new CVA occurrences (p = 0.328) between closed and non-closed groups. Our findings over a period of 13 years suggest that PFO closure may not provide a clear protective benefit against MACEs in this population, regardless of prior CVA history, highlighting the need for further research to identify specific patient subgroups that might benefit from this intervention.",

However, elucidating the mechanism of action of SNT remains challenging due to its complex multiple components. This study utilized a synergistic approach combining two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) with label-free quantitative proteomics techniques to identify the direct and indirect protein targets of SNT in myocardial infarction. The analysis identified 590 proteins, with 30 proteins showing significant upregulation and 51 proteins showing downregulation when comparing the SNT group with the model group. Through the integration of 2D-DIGE DARTS with proteomics data and pharmacological assessments, the findings indicate that protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3) may serve as a potential protein target through which SNT provides protective effects on myocardial cells during myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, need the exploration of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase（RTK）, activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), plays multifaceted roles in cellular proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. While extensively studied in oncology, emerging evidence highlights its dual regulatory functions in CVDs pathogenesis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on c-Met signaling in cardiovascular health and disease, emphasizing its context-dependent roles. In atherosclerosis, c-Met exhibits paradoxical effects-promoting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and inflammation while exerting anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic actions. Preclinical studies reveal its cardioprotective potential in myocardial infarction by enhancing cardiomyocyte survival, angiogenesis, and cardiac repair, yet aberrant c-Met activation may exacerbate pulmonary arterial hypertension via smooth muscle hyperplasia. Furthermore, c-Met influences inflammatory cell dynamics in myocarditis and modulates heart failure progression through interactions with neurohormonal pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting c-Met, including CAR-M cell therapy, small-molecule inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, show promise in preclinical models but require rigorous clinical validation. Key challenges include reconciling its dual roles across disease stages and optimizing therapeutic specificity. Future research must elucidate spatiotemporal c-Met signaling mechanisms to harness its reparative potential while mitigating pathological effects, ultimately advancing precision therapies for CVDs.",

CHF in elderly and senile patients, complicated by postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm (LVA), is a serious problem in clinical practice. Postinfarction aneurysm of the left ventricle, which occurs after a myocardial infarction, significantly worsens the prognosis, leading to a violation of heart function and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The article presents an overview of publications on the epidemiology of chronic heart failure in patients with LVA, including age and gender aspects. Based on the analysis of available publications, modern views on the problem of the emergence of LVA are highlighted. The data testifying to the prognostic significance of LVA as a factor associated with the aggravation of the course and the development of cardiovascular complications in patients with CHF are presented.

    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a leading cause of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) operations in Germany. Complications that arise during HEMS operations are challenging due to limited resources. However, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) score and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) provide potential for risk stratification. Nevertheless, there is an absence of data concerning the incidence and risk of medical events (e.g. malignant arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock) in ACS patients during HEMS operations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of medical events and to assess risk stratification using scoring systems. This retrospective observational cohort study analyzed prehospital records from 38,473 HEMS operations with \"ACS\" coding conducted between 2012 and 2024 in Germany. Routine data were systematically recorded using a standardized digital form that captured patient demographics, clinical presentation, and medical interventions. Major medical events (MME) were defined using surrogate markers, including defibrillation, resuscitation, airway management, ventilation, and new ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) findings. Scores (NACA, NEWS, and a combined MME-score) were calculated, with the MME-score integrating NACA and NEWS. Ethical approval was obtained from the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg Ethics Committee (No: 24-1082-S1, 25 April 2024). MME occurred in 8.8% of the 38,473 HEMS operations. They occurred more frequently during secondary missions (interfacility transports) (11.8%) than primary missions (6.7%), and at night (15.3%) than during the day (8.2%) (both p < 0.001). The NACA, NEWS, and MME-scores were significantly higher in cases with medical events (p < 0.001). The risk stratification exhibited areas under the curve in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, with values of 0.831 for NACA, 0.866 for NEWS, and 0.895 for the MME-score. The incidence of MMEs is subject to variation depending on the operational context. Established scoring systems such as the NACA and NEWS are available for the purpose of risk stratification of medical events in patients with ACS during air rescue operations. The combination of these scores may indicate potential for improved risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience disproportionately high mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Contemporary national trends-and their variation across demographic and geographic strata remain poorly defined. Using the CDC WONDER Multiple Cause-of-Death files, we identified U.S. decedents ≥ 65 years in whom ICD-10 codes for AMI and renal failure appeared anywhere on the death certificate between 1999 and 2023. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRS) per 100,000 population were standardized to the 2000 U.S. census. Joinpoint regression quantified annual per cent change (APC) and inflexion points overall and by sex, race/ethnicity, census region, state, and urban-rural status. Among 288,801 AMI-related renal-failure deaths, the AAMR fell from 42.1 in 1999 to 18.5 in 2023. Mortality declined steadily from 1999-2012 (APC - 3.39%; 95% CI - 4.25 to - 1.16) and more sharply from 2012-2015 (APC - 17.82%; 95% CI - 22.98 to - 6.99), but rose thereafter (2015-2023 APC + 3.01%; 95% CI - 0.21 to 16.30). Men carried persistently higher rates than women (overall AAMR 39.2 vs 21.2). Non-Hispanic Black adults had the greatest burden (AAMR 35.8), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (34.7) and Asian/Pacific Islander patients (34.2); non-Hispanic White adults had the lowest (26.4). From 2020-2023, AAMRs rebounded across most groups and surged 85% among Asian/Pacific Islanders. Regionally, the South recorded the highest AAMR (28.8), and state-level rates ranged three-fold (Utah 14.5 to Rhode Island 43.0). Non-metropolitan counties consistently exceeded metropolitan areas (34.5 vs 28.1). Two decades of improvement in AMI mortality among older adults with renal failure have stalled, with a worrisome upturn since 2015 and widening disparities by sex, race, geography, and rurality. These findings underscore the need for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-focused prevention, equitable access to acute cardiac care, and tailored post-AMI management to avert further excess deaths in this growing high-risk population.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between NV of culprit lesions and plaque rupture in patients with AMI. This study included 384 patients diagnosed with AMI. All patients were divided into Non-NV and NV groups according to whether NV was present in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the preoperative culprit lesions. Patients with NV lesions had thinner minimal fibrous cap thickness, smaller minimal lumen area and symmetry, longer lesion length, and larger plaque volume and plaque burden than patients with AMI without NV lesions (P < 0.05). Patients with both AMI and NV had a higher incidence of thin-cap fibroatheroma, cholesterol crystals, macrophages, thrombus, calcific plaque, lipid-rich plaque, and plaque rupture (P < 0.01). After adjusting for covariates, NV is independently associated with plaque rupture (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.00-5.14; P < 0.001). For the evaluation of the model after adjusting the covariates, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, clinical calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) of the model show good discriminative ability, prediction accuracy, and clinical utility. In patients with AMI, NV of culprit lesions is significantly correlated with plaque growth, formation of unstable plaque phenotypes, and plaque rupture.

    "abstract": "Bone cement leakage is a common complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty and may lead to severe complications such as intracardiac cement embolism. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography serves as a crucial tool in the diagnosis of intracardiac cement embolism. An elderly female developed acute sharp chest pain with ST-segment depression two hours postvertebroplasty and was initially suspected to have acute myocardial infarction according to her symptoms/ECGs. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography excluded the diagnosis of wall motion abnormalities but revealed a linear, highly echogenic structure within the right atrium and ventricle chambers. One end of the structure pierced the anterior wall of the right ventricle, and a small volume of pericardial effusion was detected. By integrating the patient's history of bone cement injection, sonographers quickly changed the diagnosis from infarction to cardiac rupture by cement embolism. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no abnormalities in the pulmonary artery or its distal branches. The clinicians were able to diagnose isolated intracardiac cement embolism in a timely manner. Surgical thoracotomy was performed to remove the cement from the heart and repair the right ventricle rupture. The patient's postoperative recovery went smoothly. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography may aid in the timely diagnosis of intracardiac cement embolism and characterization of its features and assist in the assessment of associated severe complications. This case report can serve as a valuable reference for guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions.",

We discuss the mechanism of action of FAPIs, their radiolabeling techniques, and their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The review then delves into the evidence supporting the use of FAPI-PET and SPECT in specific non-oncological applications, including cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, cardiac amyloidosis, and systemic vasculitis), liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases), renal diseases (chronic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, and IgA nephropathy), bone and joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, periprosthetic joint infection, and other bone and joint pathologies), and other inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease and IgG4-related disease). We analyze the diagnostic performance of FAPI imaging in these conditions, comparing it with conventional imaging techniques and highlighting its advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in the field, including the need for standardization, validation studies, and the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers to improve the clinical utility of FAPI-based imaging in non-oncological applications. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of FAPI imaging in non-oncological diseases, highlighting its potential to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of these conditions.",

    "title": "MicroRNA biosensors for cardiovascular disease detection.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain one of the highest causes of death around the world. Early identification and quick intervention are vital for improving patient outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules, have emerged as significant biomarkers for CVDs due to their involvement in various cellular activities, including cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Electrochemical biosensors offer a rapid, highly target-specific, cost-effective solution for detecting miRNA biomarkers in biological fluids. By utilizing nanomaterials and biorecognition elements, these sensors enable real-time observation of CVD progression and the patient's response to treatment. This review investigates the potential applications of miRNA-based electrochemical biosensors for the prompt detection of CVDs. It magnifies the significance of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. Moreover, we emphasize the latest innovations in electrochemical biosensors to identify miRNA biomarkers in blood, serum, and various biological samples. Drawing upon recent developments and our experience in molecular diagnostics and biosensor applications, this review highlights the integration of nanomaterial-based electrochemical biosensors for detecting microRNAs associated with cardiovascular conditions. The literature reviewed in this article was gathered from databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using keywords such as \"microRNA,\" \"cardiovascular disease,\" and \"electrochemical biosensors.\"",

    "title": "Stimuli-Responsive Luminophore Drives Mechanism Switch for Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence Immunosensing.",
    "abstract": "Although widely used in clinical diagnostics, the sensitivity of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bead-based immunoassays is intrinsically limited by the reaction mechanism driving the emission of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ on the bead surface. Depending mostly on the coreactant oxidation, the 'remote' pathway is hindered by the slow coreactant oxidation rate and the short half-lives of electrogenerated radicals. In this work, we synthesized a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative featuring a stimuli-responsive disulfide bond in its linker to the bead. Electrogenerated tri-n-propylamine (TPrA) neutral radicals reduce disulfide moieties, electrochemically inducing the release of Ru(II) labels in solution and thereby leading to an unprecedented mechanism shift toward the more efficient \"homogeneous\" ECL pathway. Leveraging ICP-MS, ECL microscopy, and finite element simulations, we demonstrate rapid bond cleavage and an impressive signal enhancement of up to 613%. Using an experimental configuration designed to emulate commercial clinical analysis, we developed an ECL-based immunoassay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in whole virus samples from swab formulations. The immunosensor incorporating the cleavable luminophore demonstrated a 40% lower detection limit and a 2-fold increase in sensitivity, while reducing TPrA consumption by 72%. These findings establish stimuli-responsive luminophores as a groundbreaking class of ECL labels, promising substantial improvements in the sensitivity of commercial biosensors.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in a Turkish population. Adult patients attending hospital consultation and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled in this study. Demographic variables, smoking status, COVID-19 symptoms, SpO2 levels, and markers of inflammation (D-Dimer, lymphocytes and white blood cells count, CRP) were recorded. Patients suspected of periodontal disease were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires (OHIP-14, modified CDC/AAP questionnaire). Periodontal screening score (PESS) was calculated from the questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between COVID-19-associated parameters and periodontitis. The study included 134 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Nearly half of the participants were female (n = 68, 50.7%), and the mean age of the patients was 48.7 ± 18.2 years. A statistically significant majority of individuals (69.2%) were asymptomatic, while 22.3% experienced mild symptoms, and 8.5% reported moderate or severe symptoms. Oxygen saturation was found to be higher in asymptomatic patients (96.4 ± 2.8) compared to mild (90.4 ± 5.1) and moderate/severe patients (86.6 ± 8.9) (P 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference concerning OHIP-14 score (P = 0.316), periodontitis (PESS ≥ 5) (P = 0.130), brushing habits (P = 0.901), and frequency of dental visits (P = 0.975) when considering SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was concluded that male gender (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.04-8.04, P = 0.040), age 55 and above (OR = 5.94, 95% CI: 1.22-28.76, P = 0.026), and smoking (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.75, P = 0.022) were statistically significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. Even the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and periodontitis, evaluated through self-reported outcome measures, were weak: male gender, age, and smoking were independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in this patient cohort. Further research is warranted to explore these associations comprehensively.",

Despite the growing HIV burden in Türkiye, data on the impact of these coinfections remain limited. To determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and syphilis coinfections in adults with HIV-1 and to examine their associations with demographics and HIV-1 viral load. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Single center, tertiary care hospital in Türkiye. Adults diagnosed with HIV-1 between March 2019 and June 2024 at Ankara Bilkent City Hospital were included. Demographic information, HIV viral load measurements, and serological and molecular test results for HBV, HCV, and syphilis were retrieved from the institutional laboratory database. Coinfection status was assessed relative to age, gender, and HIV viral load. Prevalence and distribution of HBV, HCV, and syphilis coinfections and their associations with demographic variables and HIV viral load. 724 patients. The study population was predominantly male (86%), with a median age of 40 years. Syphilis was the most common coinfection (25.6%), followed by HBV at 4.1% and HCV at 1.8%. Syphilis was significantly more prevalent among men (P=.001), and HBV coinfection was associated with older age (P=.005). No significant associations were observed between HIV viral load and any co-infection. Notably, a substantial proportion of patients, especially those newly diagnosed after 2019, had high HIV RNA levels, suggesting delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation. Triple coinfections were rare but remain clinically relevant. The high prevalence of syphilis and delayed HIV diagnoses highlight the urgent need for improved screening protocols, timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and broader implementation of HBV vaccination programs. An integrated multisectoral approach is critical to address the overlapping clinical and public health burdens posed by these co-infections. Healthcare strategies must consider the impact of COVID-19-related service disruptions, which likely contributed to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

    "abstract": "In a previous cohort of patients with new-onset of Graves' Disease (GD) during 2021, a \"postvaccine early-onset (PoVEO)\" after anti-COVID-19 vaccination emerged as a new and frequent nosological entity occurring in approximately one third of patients. Similar cohorts have also been reported with GD after anti-COVID vaccines, but to date there are no available data on long-term clinical outcomes. This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating the 24-month clinical course of patients with early-onset (<4 weeks) GD after anti-COVID vaccination (PoVEO) compared to non-PoVEO patients. Biochemical tests, therapies used and follow-up visits were scheduled according to current guidelines, clinicians' experience and patients' needs. As previously described, 64 patients were observed in 2021 and 20 (31.2%) had PoVEO. Individuals with PoVEO were characterized by distinctive features such as older age, a higher prevalence of male sex, and a better initial biochemical response. Eleven individuals were followed at other Centers (2 with PoVEO and 9 without) and were lost to follow-up. During the two-year follow-up, of the 53 individuals, 7 (13%) underwent definitive surgical or radioactive-iodine therapy (3 PoVEO and 4 non-PoVEO p = 0.67), and 30 (57%) presented disease remission with medical therapy alone. Excluding those who underwent definitive treatments, remission with medical therapy alone was observed in 13/15 (87%) individuals with PoVEO form and 17/31 (55%) non-PoVEO (p = 0.048). In this retrospective study of a cohort of individuals with the PoVEO form of GD, we found a more favourable clinical course, likely linked to transience of the triggering events. Despite these findings, individuals presenting with GD after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should undergo an active surveillance program with repeat thyroid function testing.",

    "title": "Assessment of Influenza Testing Distribution in the United States for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 Influenza Seasons: Online Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Effective surveillance of seasonal influenza is crucial to understanding disease burden and impact. Traditional surveillance accounts for those who interact with the health care system, including those who are testing for diseases like influenza. However, care seeking and testing are not as common with influenza and can lead to bias. Better understanding who is being captured by current surveillance methods can help further knowledge around influenza and identify areas of improvement in surveillance, disease mitigation, and intervention efforts. This study aimed to examine who is testing for influenza amongst a United States representative survey population, across three seasons influenza seasons spanning 2021 to 2024. Outbreaks near me (ONM) is a participatory surveillance system that, in partnership with SurveyMonkey, conducted a web-based, weekly cross-sectional survey. ONM Survey data from three influenza seasons was used in this study: 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024. Tested for influenza was defined as a \"yes\" response to \"In the past 30 days, have you been tested for influenza (flu)?\" Descriptive proportions applying survey weights reflecting US census targets were produced to understand which demographic groups were testing for influenza. A weighted multivariate logistic regression was conducted for influenza testing by income, adjusting for other demographics and COVID-19 testing. Descriptive proportions and multivariate regressions were conducted by influenza season. In total, 940,172 responses were collected, with similar amounts in 2021-2022 (n=335,964) and 2022-2023 (n=334,584), and slightly less in 2023-2024 (n=269,624). Generally, low levels of influenza testing were reported in each season at 4.2%, 9.1%, and 8.9%, respectively. Weighted proportions of those who tested for influenza only and no other diseases (like COVID-19) were even lower (0.4%, 971/335,964; 1.5%, 4,382/334,584; and 2.0%, 4579/269,624; respectively). Broadly, those who had lower income tested for influenza at progressively higher proportions. A similar trend was observed season to season with education level as well. Across the 3 observed influenza seasons, lower household annual income (under US $15,000) was associated with higher odds of testing for influenza (2021-2022: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.34-1.48; 2022-2023: AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35-1.49; 2023-2024: AOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.34), while those with higher incomes (over US $150,000) were less likely to have been tested for influenza (2021-2022: AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55-0.86; 2022-2023: AOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.91; 2023-2024: AOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.76). Within this study population, individuals who fall within lower-income brackets tested for influenza more than their higher-income counterparts. In all 3 seasons spanning 2021-2024, lower income was associated with higher proportions of influenza testing and an increased likelihood of having tested for influenza in the past 30 days. These trends suggest that populations that may experience more barriers to care are not only accessing influenza testing but doing so differently than groups that historically access care.",

Recent evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the risk of acquisition.AimThis retrospective cohort study explored risk factors, including patient COVID-19 admission status, associated with incidence rates of BSI in Scottish ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a pre-pandemic period.MethodsThree national databases were linked to create a dataset of 38,081 ICU admissions across 41 ICUs during a comparator period of March 2018 to December 2019, and pandemic period of March 2020 to December 2021. Population demographics and clinical risk factors were described according to period of admission and COVID-19 admission status. Cox regression models investigated the influence of risk factors on time to BSI, using a competing risk approach to account for death as a competing event.FindingsIn non-COVID-19 patients, the first two waves of the pandemic significantly increased hazards of BSI (Wave 1 cause-specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-1.59, wave 2a HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14-1.70), but not mortality. COVID-19 status on admission did not significantly increase hazard of BSI in the pandemic, however there was a significant interaction between COVID-19 and the use of intubation in increasing hazard of BSI (HR 4.64, 95% CI 2.07-10.4) and COVID-19 was significant in increasing the hazard of mortality (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.77-2.88).ConclusionWhile rates of ICU-acquired BSI were higher during the pandemic period, and in COVID-19 admissions, the reasons for this are multifactorial. Interpretation must consider the competing risk of mortality and how this is influenced by differences in patient population, along with changes that occurred during the pandemic in relation to infection prevention and control procedures, ICU pressures, and COVID-19 treatment and vaccination.",

Content analysis was performed by two coders using MAXQDA software (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.75). Results demonstrate that school nurses feel misunderstood in their role; they additionally experience frequent worry, low availability of substitutes, high student caseloads, stress over managing multiple buildings, and challenges navigating administrative and parental relationships; these factors were identified as sources of burnout. Nurses view peer mentorship positively, valuing the opportunity to share ideas and experiences and benefiting from a supportive organizational culture.

    "abstract": "The detection of viral gene fragments is essential for diagnosing and screening viral infections, managing virus transmission, and controlling epidemics. In this study, we developed an isothermal amplification-bridged DNA switch designed for the sensitive detection of viral gene fragments. Specifically, the binding of the target viral gene fragment to the recognition sequences triggers isothermal amplification, resulting in the production of multiple DNA products. Consequently, a single target gene fragment is transformed into approximately 1250 DNA products, which can subsequently activate the DNA switches. This activation leads to the opening of the DNA switch and the occurrence of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), generating a ratiometric fluorescent signal. The effective conversion of the target facilitated by isothermal amplification enables the generation of amplified ratiometric fluorescent signals, thereby achieving sensitive detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gene fragment with a limit of detection of 0.04 fM. An extensive linear range spanning approximately eight orders of magnitude, characterized by two distinct linear relationships, is obtained, making it particularly effective for detecting viral gene fragments in various biological samples with significantly varying concentrations of target gene fragments. The analysis of actual samples from patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms underscores the method's potential for clinical diagnostic applications. Additionally, by modifying the recognition strands, the method allows for the sensitive and selective detection of the Rabies virus (RABV) gene fragment, highlighting its versatility and adaptability. Therefore, this research presents a novel and sensitive approach for detecting viral gene fragments, offering considerable promise for the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

Proteomic screening technology and gene expression analysis were used here to define the immune response in infants, with their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. Urine and peripheral blood samples were obtained at enrollment and at follow-up, after 6 months. Pair-wise proteomic analysis of urine samples detected a broad local cytokine response in urine; 20 of the 24 proteins were strongly activated during acute infection compared with follow-up. Functional profiling identified the response as a cytokine storm, and major innate immune response regulators and effector molecules were activated, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-33, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In addition, the adaptive immune response was activated, including CD40L, IL-2, Granzyme B, IL-10, IL-15 and PD-L1. Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood RNA detected a systemic cytokine storm profile, which was more pronounced in infants with renal involvement, defined by positive acute dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, than in infants with febrile urinary tract infection without renal involvement. Local and systemic hyperactivation of innate immunity characterizes acute pyelonephritis, a common and severe bacterial infection in childhood and a significant cause of urosepsis and mortality in adults. The results define a transient cytokine storm response, resembling that induced during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as characteristic of acute pyelonephritis, rather than individual protein biomarkers.",

In an era marked by rapid industry change, escalating costs, staff shortages, and technology transformation, along with the need for consistent, high-quality care models across diverse sites, OSF recognized that its operating model would not be sustainable for its future in healthcare. Without a consistent operating model, members of the same organization would operate in leadership silos, have inconsistent strategies, and struggle to achieve operating efficiency, all of which could create internal competition. With a renewed vision of One OSF, the organization embarked on a journey to systemness by prioritizing integration, cultural alignment, and innovation. Leadership restructured core functions, such as analytics, human resources, IT, legal, marketing, and communications, while establishing centralized roles and enterprise-wide analytics to drive performance. Through the creation of the Integration Management Office, OSF brought structure and consistency to growth efforts, ensuring that new acquisitions shared the same values and standards without losing their local relevance. Systemness proved especially vital during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling OSF to dynamically reallocate resources and staff across its care sites. Today, with a focus on delivery system redesign, virtual care models, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools, OSF is building a sustainable, scalable healthcare model tailored to the unique needs of the communities it serves, including those in rural settings.

Vaccine hesitancy, an important correlate of vaccine uptake, has been studied extensively in parents with respect to parental attitudes and decision-making toward vaccinating their children. Less work has examined parent attitudes and behaviors regarding personal vaccine uptake and how COVID-19-related vaccine attitudes and behaviors may differ from other types of vaccine attitudes and behaviors (e.g., influenza vaccination). We surveyed a probability-based sample of 585 United States adults in November 2021. Parents (i.e., primary caregiver of at least one child aged 18 years or younger, living in the home) compared to other adults, demographics (age, sex, income, education, ethnicity, urbanicity), and political affiliation were examined as correlates of COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake. Multivariate linear regression analyses examined attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to other adults, parents of children aged 18 years or younger reported more negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariate logistic models examined the odds of COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine uptake. Compared to other adults, parents of children aged 18 years or younger had a significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine uptake; differences in influenza vaccine uptake were not statistically significant. Results suggest vaccination attitudes and behaviors may be pathogen specific. Tailored public health messaging that address the concerns of caregivers may help improve vaccine uptake.",

We utilized population-level data to understand the coalition's reach to counties experiencing health inequities. Community-based organizations (N = 29) involved in this coalition all served rural counties and counties with greater burden from COVID-19 hospitalizations, heart disease mortality, and cancer mortality. Food quality and access, economic stability, and education were identified by coalition members as the primary determinants of health impacting their communities. Coalition members completed a baseline survey, participated in coalition activities focused on addressing these primary determinants of health, and then completed a follow-up survey 3-months later. Coalition members reported significant increases in several domains of their community-based organizations' capacity to address select determinants of health across assessments. Specifically, there were significant increases in the average number of partnerships facilitated and the average number of educational sessions offered by the community-based organization that addressed economic stability, education, and food access and quality. The Arkansas Social Justice Coalition effectively created a network of 29 community-based organizations dedicated to addressing determinants of health to reduce the disproportionate burden of COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, and cancer affecting their communities.

    "abstract": "To assess the prevalence of undernutrition, overnutrition, and simultaneous malnutrition in a hospital setting, as well as undernutrition risk and dietetic intervention rates. A point prevalence survey was conducted annually from 2016 to 2024 (excluding 2020-2021 due to Coronavirus Disease 2019) across three metropolitan health service hospital sites. Eligible multiday inpatients underwent bedside assessments and medical record reviews to determine Body Mass Index, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool scores, and undernutrition status based on either the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, or the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition. Data were analysed descriptively. Of 5186 patients surveyed, 21.2% were undernourished, 39.5% were overnourished, and 4.8% were simultaneously under- and overnourished. Just over one-third (37.4%) of all participants were at risk of undernutrition. Dietitian intervention rates were highest among the simultaneously malnourished (70.6%) and undernourished (69.6%), and low among the overnourished (3.6%). The findings underscore the need for improved detection of simultaneous malnutrition and increased rates (towards 100%) of dietary intervention among patients with either under- or simultaneous malnutrition during a patient's hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health issue in Bengaluru, India. This study analyzes TB trends, treatment outcomes, and the impact of COVID-19 on TB incidence from 2017 to 2023. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing TB treatment outcomes. An Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis using an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on TB incidence. Among 71,883 TB cases, age ≥65 years had increased the risk of unsuccessful outcomes for pulmonary TB (PTB) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.24-2.89) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) (aOR 3.72; CI, 3.06-4.52). Females had lower odds than males in PTB (aOR 0.72; CI, 0.67-0.78) and EPTB (aOR 0.77; CI, 0.68-0.86). Diabetics had lowered risk for PTB (aOR 0.62; CI, 0.57-0.68) but increased risk for EPTB (aOR 1.44; CI, 1.24-1.67). HIV cases had increased risk in PTB (aOR 1.96; CI, 1.67-2.31) and EPTB (aOR 2.88; CI, 2.32-3.57). Interaction analysis in PTB showed diabetics with ages 35-44 and 45-54 was associated with lower risk (aOR 0.66; CI, 0.44-0.99; aOR 0.67; CI, 0.46-0.99). ITS analysis showed a 24.3% average decline in TB notifications in 2020, reaching a maximum decline of 40.5% in April. This study highlights factors affecting TB treatment outcomes and the significant impact of COVID-19 on TB trends in Bengaluru, providing insights to improve TB control and mitigate future pandemic impacts.",

An analytical study is performed, where the existence of solutions of traveling waves in a bounded domain is demonstrated. We use the upper and lower coupled solutions method to achieve this aim. The existence and local asymptotic stability of the endemic ( E e  ) and disease-free ( E 0  ) equilibrium states are also determined. The constructed model includes a discrete-time delay that is related to the incubation stage of a virus. We find the crucial basic reproduction number  ℛ 0    , which determines the local stability of the steady states. We perform numerical simulations of the model in order to provide additional support to the theoretical results and observe the traveling waves. The model can be used to study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses where the disease evolution has a similar behavior.",

    "abstract": "Access to sexual and reproductive health care has been a critical issue affecting public health outcomes, particularly for the youth population. This project identified common barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health care for youth in rural areas and applied multiple educational and clinical interventions that helped enhance access to care. We designed a three-year-long program at Finger Lakes Community Health (FLCH) in rural upstate New York that involved youth, their parents or caregivers, educators, and medical professionals to improve youth access to care. Using results from a survey with 1155 youth participants to determine the barriers to care, we designed the program to overcome the fear of seeking help, basic facts ignorance, transportation issues, parental opposition, and financial issues. We implemented multiple interventions, including providing adequate education and school services, ensuring privacy and confidentiality, changing work hours, establishing phone and online services, facilitating transportation, and reducing cost barriers. The results were dramatic. Sexual and reproductive health visits to FLCH from youth in the region increased significantly from 280 in 2017 to 1100 in 2019. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the number of visits slightly decreased, visits were still better than before 2018. In 2023, the number of reproductive health visits was 990, which is 3.5 times the visits in 2017. This study emphasizes the substantial role that tailored interventions can play in enhancing reproductive health access for youth in rural areas, significantly promoting healthcare equity and service utilization. These interventions reduce healthcare use inequities and foster potential improved public health outcomes. While our study did not directly measure clinical outcomes, the substantial increase in utilization represents an important step toward achieving them and underscores the need for further research to evaluate resulting health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence links low physical activity (PA) and dysregulated lipid metabolism to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. This study aimed to determine which gestational stage is more vulnerable to low PA and whether changes in blood lipids mediate this risk. A retrospective analysis was conducted among 3997 pregnant women (614 with GDM) during the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, a unique natural experiment provided by the uniform imposition of PA restrictions. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between low PA at different gestational stages and GDM risk, while mediation analyses explored the role of blood lipids. Women with GDM were older and had higher rates of overweight/obesity compared with non-GDM participants. Notably, the GDM group exhibited a higher prevalence of low PA during early pregnancy and elevated lipid levels. Logistic regression demonstrated that low PA during early pregnancy was significantly associated with increased GDM risk (OR = 2.041, 95% CI: 1.577-2.644). Moreover, low PA was significantly linked to dysregulated lipid profiles in both early and mid-pregnancy. Mediation analysis further indicated that elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels partially mediated this relationship. In contrast, low PA in mid-pregnancy was not directly linked to GDM (OR = 1.244, 95% CI: 0.966-1.6), although increased triglyceride (TG) levels during this stage mediated an effect on GDM risk. Early pregnancy is a critical window for GDM prevention. Additionally, these findings advocate for stage-specific exercise and lipid management strategies to reduce GDM risk and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and the relaxation of social restrictions, it seems intuitive to expect significant reductions in learning difficulties and psychological distress among adolescents. However, their psychological recovery could be hindered by the increased stress arising from rapidly changing environments, particularly for those from less developed regions. A three-wave study focusing on Chinese adolescents (N = 962) from economically disadvantaged regions was conducted to examine their psychological distress and academic inefficacy changes before and after the relaxation of the Zero-COVID policy established in December 2022 as well as to identify predictors and mediators of the change trajectories across T1 (three months before the policy), T2 (three months after the policy), and T3 (six months after T2). Counterintuitively, latent growth modeling (LGM) indicated deteriorating trends in students' psychological distress and academic inefficacy. From a change management perspective, structural equation modeling (SEM) further showed that at the individual level, perceived legitimacy of change (T2) was found to positively predict the slopes of psychological distress and academic inefficacy from T1 to T3 through the mediation of self-determination need fulfillment (T2), whereas perceived change unplannedness (T2) negatively predicted the changes, mediated by perceived relative deprivation (T2). These findings shed light on the risk and resilience factors of disadvantaged adolescents' post-pandemic psychological recovery, providing important implications for policymakers and the community.",

It is characterised by acute and chronic complications that often require immediate and easy access to appropriate healthcare services, including emergency, in-patient, and non-preventive care. Poor access to healthcare services and healthcare-seeking behaviour are responsible for most SCD-preventable deaths. The determinants of healthcare service use among people living with SCD should be identified and addressed. Thus, the study investigated the accessibility and utilisation of healthcare services and its determinants among people living with SCD in the Upper West Region. This cross-sectional study involved 248 people with SCD in the Upper West Region accessing healthcare at the Wa Municipal Hospital's Sickle Cell Unit, selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Data collected were collected using a pretested questionnaire and analysed using SPSS v22.0. The analysis included descriptive statistics, a chi-square test, and a logistic regression test at a 95% confidence interval with significance set at p < 0.05. 58% had poor access to healthcare facilities providing SCD care, and 92% had used healthcare services regularly within the last 12 months. Health problems responsible for most hospital visits were painful crises (96.5%), fever (96.0%), acute respiratory problems (85.1%), pneumonia and influenza (74.2%), and acute otitis media (32.6%) in the last 12 months.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the uptake of childhood vaccinations before the age of five has declined globally. In England, the decline in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage is concerning and has subsequently been followed by an increase in measles outbreaks. This study analysed the sustained and additional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on area-level inequalities in childhood vaccination uptake across regions in England. Spline regressions with three-way interaction terms were used to assess the impact of COVID-19, from the first lockdown, on local authorities across regions and deprivation quartiles. Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly data was used for the uptake statistics, and the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019 for the deprivation quartiles. The lowest coverage vaccines were analysed: the pre-school booster (one dose) and MMR (two doses, cumulative) from July - September 2014 to October - December 2022. The findings suggest the odds of childhood vaccination uptake were declining in England prior to the first lockdown, but there was an additional decrease associated with this event by 12% (OR:0.88, CI:0.79-0.99, p < .05) for the pre-school booster and 13% (OR:0.87, CI:0.77-0.99, p < .05) for the MMR vaccine. For local authorities classified as the most deprived 25% (Quartile 1), there was a 15% (OR: 0.85, CI: (0.72-0.99, p < .05) post-lockdown-associated decline in the odds of MMR uptake, but not the pre-school booster. Post-lockdown and region interaction effects for the pre-school booster were as follows: Yorkshire and the Humber, 39% decreased odds (OR:0.61, CI:0.54-0.68, p < .001); East Midlands, 22% decreased odds (OR:0.77 OR, CI:0.62-0.95, p < .05); and West Midlands, 19% increased odds (OR:1.19, CI:1.00-1.40, p < .05). For the MMR vaccine, these were: Yorkshire and the Humber, 41% decreased odds (OR:0.59, CI:0.52-0.67, p < .001); North West, 30% increased odds (OR:1.3, CI:1.04-1.64, p < .05); West Midlands, 21% increased odds (OR:1.21, CI:1-1.46, p < .05); and South East, 19% decreased odds (OR:0.67, CI:0.98, p < .05). Evidence of three-way post-lockdown interaction effects for deprivation quartile and region was also identified for both vaccines. The results highlight the need for national vaccination uptake analyses to consider regional variation, as similarly deprived local authorities do not necessarily exhibit the same COVID-19-associated effects.",

Despite its significant public health impact, molecular epidemiological data on EBV in Saudi Arabia, especially its southwestern region, are scarce. This study aims to characterize EBV epidemiology and clinical correlations using reference laboratory data from Southwestern Saudi Arabia collected between 2020 and 2023, while identifying associated demographic and clinical factors. This retrospective study was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed EBV cases, and Ethical Approval was obtained. Descriptive statistics, χ [2] tests, and multivariate regression were employed to analyze demographic and clinical data from 133 EBV-positive patients. These analyses aimed to identify associations with age, gender, nationality, year of diagnosis, and clinical presentation, considering results statistically significant at p < 0.05. The overall EBV prevalence was 17.5% (133/760). Temporal analysis indicated an increase in cases from 2020 to 2022, followed by a remarkable decrease in 2023 (13.5%, p = 0.01), likely attributable to post-COVID-19 shifts in healthcare practices. Furthermore, seasonal patterns displayed a bimodal distribution, peaking in the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quarters. Saudi nationals comprised n = 103 (77.4%) of positive cases with the highest burden among children, with n = 101 (76%) of cases occurring in children under 12 years (toddlers 1-5 years: n = 57, 42.9%; children 6-12 years: n = 44, 33.1%). Infectious diseases (n = 38, 28.6%) and hematological disorders (n = 27, 20.3%) were the most common clinical associations. A correlation was found between clinical diagnosis and both gender (p = 0.04) and age group (p = 0.001). Finally, age (β = -0.411, p = 0.029) and test date (β = -0.187, p = 0.03) were significant negative predictors of EBV infection. This study establishes the first molecular-based epidemiological analysis of EBV infection in Southwestern Saudi Arabia, revealing distinct demographic and clinical patterns, with predominant pediatric involvement and strong age-related associations. The observed temporal fluctuations, including pandemic-related changes, emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance. These findings indicate the importance of pediatric-focused monitoring, region-specific diagnostic protocols, and further research into ethnic disparities, coinfections, and long-term clinical outcomes. The key limitations of this study include its retrospective design, the absence of systematic evaluation of coinfections (including COVID-19), and the use of data from a single region. To understand the burden of this virus at the national level, further national studies are required.",

A key challenge remains identifying optimal moments for public health interventions to inform evidence-based decisions. Real-time PCR was employed to quantify IAV concentrations in wastewater samples from 38 treatment plants in Shenzhen, China (n = 2,764), collected weekly from March 2023 to March 2024. The random forest model was used to estimate IAV infections based on viral concentrations and physico-chemical parameters. Baseline IAV concentrations were established using mean, geometric, and median values, revealing a seasonal IAV pattern with peaks in winter 2023 and spring 2024. The optimized random forest model (mean absolute error = 2,307, R2 = 0.988) integrated IAV concentration, flow rate, wastewater temperature, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and phosphorus. The established baseline values of IAV concentration provides crucial evidence for optimal timing (early March and mid-November) of seasonal vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions. The baseline defined as the median provided 2 to 4 weeks early warning before influenza season onset (≥ 100 cases/100,000). The median baseline also allows early detection of abnormal increases in respiratory syncytial virus, supporting timely public health interventions. Wastewater surveillance of IAV, which encompasses the entire population, closely aligns with clinical monitoring trends, underscoring its vital role as a complementary tool in public health. The estimated number of infections and the baseline defined by median offer valuable insights to guide vaccination timing and non-pharmaceutical interventions, ultimately improving community health and disease control efforts.Highlightsλ By integrating clinical surveillance and wastewater monitoring data, dynamic baselines were established to detect real-time IAV concentration changes, enabling the early identification of epidemic risks.λ IAV baselines in wastewater guide optimal timing for vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions, especially in developing counties.λ The Random Forest model accurately predicts IAV cases using key physico-chemical parameters like IAV concentration, flow rate, wastewater temperature, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and phosphorus.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected daily life and posed significant challenges for politics, the economy, and the education system. To better prepare for such situations and implement effective measures, it is crucial to accurately assess, monitor, and forecast the progression of a pandemic. This study examines the potential of integrating wastewater surveillance data to enhance an autoregressive COVID-19 forecasting model for Germany and its federal states. First, we explore the cross-correlations between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load measured in wastewater and COVID-19 hospitalization considering different time-lags. Further, the study compares the performance of different models, including Random Forest regressors, XGBoost regressors, ARIMA models, linear regression, and ridge regression models, both with and without the use of wastewater data as predictors. For decision tree-based models, we also analyze the performance of fully cross-modal models that rely solely on viral load measurements to predict COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Our retrospective analysis suggest that wastewater data can potentially serve as an early warning indicator of impending trends in hospitalization at a national level, as it shows a strong correlation with hospitalization figures of up to 86% and tends to lead them by up to 8 days. Despite this, including wastewater data in the prediction models did not statistical significantly enhance the accuracy of COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts. The ARIMA model without the inclusion of wastewater viral load data emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 4.76% forecasting hospitalization 7 days ahead. However, wastewater viral load proved to be a valuable standalone predictor, offering an objective alternative to classical surveillance methods for monitoring pandemic trends. This study reinforces the potential of wastewater surveillance as an early warning tool for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Germany. While strong correlations were observed, the integration of wastewater data into predictive models did not improve their performance. Nevertheless, wastewater viral load serves as a valuable indicator for monitoring pandemic trends, suggesting its utility in public health surveillance and resource allocation. Further research may help to clarify the real-time applicability of wastewater data and expand its use to other pathogens and data sources.",

    "abstract": "Viral respiratory infections (VRTIs) caused by influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 pose significant global health challenges. Clinical outcomes are further exacerbated by infections with hospital acquired drug resistant pathogens (DRPs). A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data of 1,051 hospitalized patients with VRTIs from 2018 to 2024 at Beijing Ditan Hospital. Firstly, 280 drug-resistant strains were isolated from 185 patients with hospital-acquired DRPs infections for extended antibiogram analysis. Secondly, Interpretable machine learning (ML) was employed to predict the risk factors for hospital acquired DRPs infections in patients with VRTIs. Using the optimal feature subset, seven ML prediction models were developed. Parameter tuning was performed via 10-fold cross-validation and grid search. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to interpret the optimal model. Pathogen distribution in 280 clinical samples revealed sputum (65.36%) as themainsource, followed byblood (15.36%), urine (11.43%), and lavage fluid (5.00%). In all clinical specimens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii predominated in sputum, blood, urine, and lavage fluid, respectively. In terms of overall detection counts, the most frequently isolated strains were P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and A. baumannii. The drug resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to third-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) exceeds 89%, but it has relatively higher sensitivity to ceftazidime (71.7%) and cefepime (69.6%). Its drug resistance rates to imipenem and meropenem reach 45.7%. Although amikacin shows 100% sensitivity, combination with β-lactam antibiotics is recommended to reduce mortality. K. pneumoniae shows resistance rates of 53.3% to imipenem and 46.7% to meropenem, with over 50% resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Effective agents include sulfamethoxazole (68.9% susceptible), tigecycline (64.4%), chloramphenicol (62.2%), and amikacin (62.2%). Tigecycline combined with aminoglycosides has synergistic effects and inhibits resistant strains. A. baumannii was highly resistant to nearly all tested antibiotics, showing only partial susceptibility to minocycline (59.5%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (38.1%). Among the seven ML models, the neural network (NN) achieved the best predictive performance. The SHAP method revealed the top 15 predictive variables by importance ranking, including length of stay (LOS), cholinesterase (CHE), age, albumin (ALB), etc.",

We conducted a retrospective time-series study of 53,088 pediatric patients tested for RV and AdV from April 2020 to August 2024. Age-stratified positivity rates were analyzed alongside temporal trends. Daily meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) and air pollutants were incorporated into a generalized additive model (GAM) framework with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) to assess delayed and nonlinear associations between weather exposures and virus positivity. RV was the most frequently detected virus (7.74%), peaking in preschool-aged children (3-6 years), while AdV showed broader age distribution with highest positivity in toddlers (1-3 years). Coinfections were most common in children under 2 years. Significant seasonal and interannual fluctuations were observed, particularly a post-pandemic RV surge in 2024. Spearman analysis revealed inverse correlations between RV/AdV positivity and temperature. DLNMs showed that RV risk increased significantly under low wind (RR = 1.79, lag 0), cold (RR = 1.47, lag 21), and dry conditions (RR = 1.23, lag 15). AdV exhibited a U-shaped humidity-risk curve and increased risk with cold and moderately humid conditions. Coinfection risk was primarily driven by cold temperatures. Significant interactions were found between temperature and wind (RV) and between temperature and humidity (AdV). Season-stratified analysis indicated atypical spring and summer RV peaks. This study is the first in China to apply DLNMs in a large pediatric cohort to evaluate climate-driven risk of RV and AdV infections. Findings reveal pathogen-specific, delayed meteorological sensitivities and post-COVID shifts in transmission patterns, providing a foundation for climate-informed surveillance and targeted interventions in pediatric gastroenteritis control.",

These findings demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of engineered viral RBD as immediate-acting and long-lasting single-dose antiviral drugs through rapid receptor blocking and ensuing adaptive immunity induction.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 hospital caseload indicates the quality of hospital care, as resources were redirected to address the surge in COVID-19 cases. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 hospital caseload on hospital tuberculosis (TB) case fatality rate (CFR) mediated by the TB caseload and severity of patients. A retrospective analysis of TB patients' hospital admission data in Thailand extracted from the Thai Health Information Portal database between January 2017 and September 2022. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to determine the severity of hospitalised TB patients. An interrupted time series analysis, lag time analysis and serial mediation analysis were done. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was a 12.9% decrease in monthly hospital TB caseload, and a 14.1% increase in monthly TB hospital CFR compared to the counterfactual scenario had there been no COVID-19. COVID-19 hospital caseload had a strong negative correlation with TB hospital caseload (r = - 0.60, p-value = < 0.001), but a strong positive correlation with TB hospital CFR (r = 0.74, p-value = < 0.001) during the same month. An increase in average CCI score of 0.1 was associated with an increase of 2.3 deaths per 100 TB admissions. After adjusting the TB caseload and CCI of TB patients admitted to the hospital, no association was found between COVID-19 hospital caseload and the hospital CFR of TB patients. The increase in TB hospital CFR during COVID-19 pandemic was likely driven by a higher proportion of severe cases being admitted, rather than a decline in hospitals' quality of care.",

    "abstract": "Individuals aged 80 and older face a notably increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical guidelines recommend routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, yet its application in oldest-old patients remains insufficiently studied. To assess the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 80 years and older. We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolling in-hospital COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 80 years from six tertiary hospitals in China between December 2022 and January 2023. The clinical outcomes were VTE, all-cause mortality and bleeding events. Patients were followed up for 3 months after discharge. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors and evaluate the impact of LMWH prophylaxis on clinical outcomes. Among 1526 patients aged ≥ 80 years, 41.6% received LMWH prophylaxis. LMWH prophylaxis significantly reduced VTE risk by 50% (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.75) and mortality risk by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.99), without increasing bleeding risk (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.34). Male, history of stroke, critical illness on admission and hemoglobin < 90 g/L were identified as risk factors of bleeding. LMWH prophylaxis remained effective in preventing VTE and demonstrated favorable safety particularly in male patients and patients with hemoglobin < 90 g/L. LMWH may be safe and effective for thromboprophylaxis in the oldest-old COVID-19 patients, even in patients with high bleeding risk. Further studies are needed to verify our findings.",

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is a chronic, debilitating infection that predominantly affects patients with a low body mass index (BMI) and leads to progressive destruction of lung parenchyma. Although pneumonia is a common cause of death among patients with NTM-PD, information on its prognosis is scarce. We evaluated the association between BMI and outcomes in patients with NTM-PD who were hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we identified patients with NTM-PD hospitalized for CAP between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2020, prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Japan. We evaluated in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome, and length of hospital stay and readmission due to CAP within 1 year as secondary outcomes. Restricted cubic spline regression models were used to evaluate the impact of BMI as a continuous variable on the study outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders. We included 13,302 patients (median age: 79 years [interquartile range {IQR} 72-85]; women: 63.7%; median BMI: 17.6 kg/m2 [IQR 15.6-19.9]). The median hospital stay was 14 d (IQR 9-25), and in-hospital mortality was 10.9%. In the restricted cubic spline model, being underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2) was associated with a sharp increase in both in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay. In the overweight group (25-30 kg/m2), high BMI was not associated with adverse outcomes. Being underweight was also associated with a modest increase in readmission because of CAP within 1 year. These findings indicate that assessing BMI may play a critical role in stratifying risk and optimizing management of CAP in patients with NTM-PD.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing emergence of Omicron subvariants, which exhibit significant resistance to existing therapeutic antibodies, underscores the urgent need to develop new reagents capable of broadly and effectively neutralizing current subvariants. Antigen-specific memory B cells were sorted by flow cytometry. The heavy and light variable region genes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were amplified and cloned into expression vectors. Following protein expression, the binding and neutralizing activities of the mAbs were assessed using ELISA, biolayer interferometry (BLI), and neutralization assays. Additionally, the neutralizing mechanism of mAb C12 was analyzed through protein modeling. We identified two receptor-binding domain (RBD)-targeting cross-neutralizing antibodies (cross-NAbs), B5 and C12. C12 demonstrated potent neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and BF.7, with IC50 values below 0.0300 µg/mL, and against XBB and EG.5, with IC50 values of 0.2340 µg/mL and 0.2762 µg/mL, respectively. B5 exhibited strong neutralizing activity against WT, BA.1, and BA.2, with IC50 values below 0.0900 µg/mL, and moderate neutralizing ability against BA.4/5, XBB, and EG.5. BLI experiments revealed that both B5 and C12 bind strongly to the RBD of WT and BA.1, with KD values below 1.0 × 10-12 M. Structural modeling of the C12-RBD complex suggested that the full contact of the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) loop with the RBD, together with region between the light chain complementarity-determining region 3 (LCDR3) and the RBD, may contribute to the cross-neutralizing activity of C12. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of B5 and C12 against evolving Omicron subvariants and provide insights for antibody engineering and vaccine design.",

This retrospective comparative study analyzed 173 patients with leg trauma-related orthopedic infections from June 2018 to May 2025, divided into two periods based on China's pandemic control policy changes in December 2022: pre-policy adjustment (n = 86) and post-policy adjustment (n = 87). Our study revealed four major pandemic-driven changes: First, patients were significantly younger (50.6 ± 15.0 vs 52.6 ± 16.1 years, p < 0.001) with dramatically reduced hospital stays (16.9 ± 11.3 vs 28.0 ± 26.2 days, p < 0.001). Second, bacterial ecology shifted markedly, with S. aureus prevalence declining from 53.5% to 41.4% while E. faecium emerged exclusively in the post-policy period (4.6%). Third, antibiotic resistance patterns showed divergent trends: β-lactam resistance improved (40.1% to 30.2%), whereas resistance to fluoroquinolones (24.9% to 36.3%), macrolides (40.0% to 59.2%), and lincosamides (40.8% to 52.5%) increased significantly. Fourth, MRSA prevalence among S. aureus isolates rose from approximately 40% to 45%, although glycopeptides and lipopeptides maintained excellent efficacy (≤ 1.1% resistance). These findings highlight pandemic-driven changes in orthopedic infections, necessitating updated antibiotic protocols and strengthened antimicrobial stewardship.",

This study introduces iron/zinc oxide-reinforced carbon nanofibers (Fe/Zn-CNFs) synthesized via a scalable electrospinning process as a novel solution for treating pharmaceutical waste streams. The synthesized nanofibers showed a crystalline structure (confirmed by XRD and Raman analyses), an optimized bandgap energy of 2.899 eV (determined by DRS), and an impressive specific surface area of 554 m²/g (measured by BET analysis). Their synergistic photocatalytic activity arises from the effective integration of iron/zinc oxide nanoparticles into the carbon nanofiber matrix. Key parameters influencing azithromycin degradation including pH, reaction time, catalyst concentration, and pollutant concentration were systematically optimized. Under optimal conditions (pH 4, 27.1 mg/L catalyst dose, 15.8 mg/L azithromycin concentration), the nanofibers achieved a remarkable 97.5% degradation of azithromycin within 103 min under UV irradiation. The study further proved the photocatalyst's versatility, achieving degradation efficiencies of 98% under UV light and up to 85% under visible light, highlighting its ability to utilize diverse light sources. The reusability testing over five consecutive cycles revealed that the Fe/Zn-CNFs maintained over 80% degradation efficiency in the final cycle, underscoring their excellent stability and practical applicability. Beyond photocatalytic efficiency, the nanofibers exhibited notable antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which can be attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results underscore the potential of iron/zinc oxide-reinforced carbon as a sustainable and effective photocatalyst for treating antibiotic-contaminated wastewater, offering a viable approach to modifying environmental antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Here we report a novel platform for the detection of nucleocapsid (N) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 viruses using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. We demonstrate that the functionalization of SPR sensors with molecular 2D materials - 1 nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) significantly enhances sensitivity. CNMs terminated with azide linker (N3-CNM) enable covalent bonding of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for specific immobilization of the N- and S-proteins to the sensor surface. The successful and stable hierarchical functionalization is confirmed by multiparametric SPR measurements complemented with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. The obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for the N-protein and the S-protein in the physiological buffer are 570 ± 50 pM and 22 ± 2 pM and the low detection limits (LODs) are ~ 190 pM and ~ 10 pM, respectively. The high specificity of the developed sensors is shown via their negligible cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV proteins. Finally, detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in nasopharyngeal swab samples with the LOD of ~ 40 pM is demonstrated. The proposed methodology enables the development of biosensors that cover clinically relevant range for the direct and immediate detection of SARS-CoV-2 without any amplification or labeling.",

    "abstract": "The escalating rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) casts a grave shadow over global public health, making once manageable infections increasingly difficult to treat. Despite advancements in combination chemotherapy for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), this pathogen remains a formidable foe. TB is now the second leading cause of death worldwide from infectious diseases, only surpassed by COVID-19. It is the primary driver of AMR-related deaths, particularly among HIV co-infected individuals. A significant challenge lies in TB's resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, the most widely used class, comprising about 65% of global antibiotic consumption. This resistance is driven by the bacterium's β-lactamase enzyme (BlaC) production, which neutralizes the antibiotic by hydrolyzing the β-lactam ring. Although BlaC remains susceptible to β-lactamase inhibitors (MBIs) like sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanate, resistance mutations in secondary catalytic sites pose an emerging threat, potentially undermining these inhibitors. To combat this evolving challenge, a comprehensive study explored BlaC's role in AMR. The research spanned six phases, from gene and protein sequence analysis to dynamic protein modelling and mutational landscape exploration. Homology modelling was employed to generate structures for all 40 BlaC variants, with stability assessed through Ramachandran plots. Drug-protein interactions with six β-lactam agents and MBIs were investigated via automated docking and simulation studies. These insights provide a deeper understanding of BlaC-mediated resistance in TB and offer a promising foundation for future drug development to address this global health crisis.",

This study aimed to explore the sex-based differences in psychological symptoms among Chinese ICU healthcare workers and compare psychological symptoms between those who directly participated in COVID-19 anti-epidemic work and those who did not. This cross-sectional study evaluated the psychological symptoms of ICU healthcare workers using the Chinese version of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), with higher scores indicating more severe psychological symptoms. Generalised linear models were applied to explore sex-based differences and compare those who directly participated in COVID-19 anti-epidemic work and those who were not psychologically symptomatic after controlling for sociodemographic variables. A total of 3871 ICU healthcare workers, consisting of 2186 women and 1685 men, were included. There were significant differences between male and female scores of somatisation (adjusted unstandardised regression coefficients (B)=-0.611; 95% CI=-1.190 to -0.032; p=0.039), depression (adjusted B=-0.765; 95% CI=-1.484 to -0.046; p=0.037) and paranoid ideation (adjusted B=0.318; 95% CI=0.023 to 0.613; p=0.035), adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Participants who had directly engaged in COVID-19 anti-epidemic work had significantly lower scores on the 10 SCL-90 subscales and total scores than did those who had not (all p<0.05). Female ICU healthcare workers presented more severe somatisation and depression, whereas men presented more severe paranoid ideation. Healthcare workers directly involved in COVID-19 anti-epidemic work had better mental health status than those who were not. Scheduling rest time reasonably helps alleviate somatisation and depression. More optimistic attitudes and better communication skills are beneficial for reducing paranoid ideation.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of post-COVID-19 depression among Iranian nurses, identify at-risk groups and provide practical recommendations for intervention. In adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, encompassing studies published from 2019 to 2024. Comprehensive searches were performed across international and Iranian databases. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scientific Information Database. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) conducted on the population of Iranian nurses, (2) keywords explicitly included in the title or abstract, (3) studies published between 2019 and 2024, (4) published in Persian or English and (5) reported the prevalence of depression either in the entire population or differentiated by gender. Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers, and quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Statistical analyses were executed using random effects models to estimate pooled prevalence rates, with subgroup analyses and sensitivity tests conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity and confirm result robustness. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria, capturing data from various provinces across Iran. The pooled prevalence of depression among Iranian nurses post-COVID-19 was estimated at 23% (95% CI 19% to 30%), indicating a substantial mental health burden within this population. Subgroup analyses revealed notable disparities in depression rates across demographic and professional characteristics. Nurses holding advanced degrees exhibited a higher mean depression score (13.33, 95% CI 9.48 to 16.74) compared with those with bachelor's degrees. Male nurses also reported slightly higher depression scores (12.04, 95% CI 7.58 to 16.50) than their female counterparts. Furthermore, moderate depression emerged as the most common severity level, affecting 24% of nurses. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that no single study disproportionately influenced the pooled estimates, reinforcing the reliability of the findings. This review and meta-analysis illuminate the mental health challenges faced by Iranian nurses in the wake of COVID-19. With a significant proportion of nurses experiencing depression, addressing their psychological needs is imperative. Tailored interventions, such as stress management workshops, access to professional counselling and workplace policies that prioritise mental health, are essential to enhance resilience and sustain healthcare quality during future public health crises. Efforts must also focus on structural changes to create a supportive environment that fosters well-being and professional satisfaction among nurses, ultimately improving patient outcomes and overall healthcare system performance.",

    "abstract": "We sought to evaluate the relationship between neighborhood-level deprivation and perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth, as well as COVID-19 outcomes among pregnant patients during the early pandemic. We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective longitudinal cohort study that investigated the impact of prenatal COVID-19 exposure on perinatal outcomes. Pregnant patients were recruited 12/23/20-7/18/22 and serially assessed for COVID-19 exposure during pregnancy, with serum antibody testing, electronic medical record review, and patient report. For this secondary analysis, address at the time of delivery was used to categorize patients into low ADI (≤50th percentile Area Deprivation Index, indicating low level of deprivation) and highest ADI (≥75th percentile, indicating highest level of deprivation) groups. The primary outcome was preterm birth, at <37 weeks, <34 weeks, and <28 weeks; secondary outcomes included other perinatal complications as well as COVID-19 outcomes. To further evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy outcomes, we completed a subgroup analysis evaluating perinatal outcomes among patients who were SARS-CoV-2-positive at any point in pregnancy. Finally, we stratified patients by race to determine whether racism further impacted outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, preterm birth, and gestational age at delivery. 306 patients were included: 124 in the low ADI group and 182 in the highest ADI group. Baseline characteristics differed between groups, including notably lower rates of COVID-19 vaccination in the highest ADI group (24.2% vs 54.0%, p < 0.01). Overall, preterm birth rates did not differ between highest and low ADI groups (23.1% vs 17.7%, respectively, p = 0.26); however, highest ADI was significantly associated with higher rates of preterm birth before 28 weeks (12.1% vs 4.0%, p = 0.01) and before 34 weeks (12.6% vs 5.7%, p = 0.04) even after adjusting for obesity and tobacco use (<28 weeks aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.73; <34 weeks aOR 0.35 95% CI 95% 0.14-0.87). The highest ADI group was more likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection (59.3% vs 41.9% p < 0.01), and more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 (3.9% vs 0.0%, p = 0.04). In a subgroup analysis of patients who were SARS-CoV-2-positive during pregnancy, there were no differences found between ADI groups. After stratification by race, there were no statistically significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, average gestational age at delivery, or preterm delivery rates between highest and low ADI groups for any race. Patients in the highest ADI group, therefore living in the most deprived neighborhoods, were more likely to experience extremely preterm birth, contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and become hospitalized due to COVID-19. The interplay of social determinants of health and perinatal outcomes must be better studied to target interventions to modifiable risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Persistent pulmonary dysfunction is common after COVID-19, yet traditional assessments using carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) alone may miss alveolar-capillary impairment. To determine whether combining nitric oxide (DLNO5s) and carbon monoxide (DLCO5s) diffusing capacities enhances detection of post-COVID-19 lung impairment and whether summed z-scores outperform individual measures in classifying affected individuals. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis using hierarchical mixed-effects modelling. The dataset included 572 COVID-19 survivors and 72 matched controls from six European centres. Lung function metrics-including spirometry, total lung capacity, DLNO5s and DLCO5s-were standardised into z-scores. Logistic models were compared using Bayesian Information Criterion and Leave-One-Out Information Criterion. Classification accuracy was assessed with Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Principal Component Analysis examined score structures, and dyspnoea severity was correlated with z-scores. Assessments were conducted 32-575 days post-infection (median=130 days). The number of days between SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and testing did not affect any of the measured z-scores. Summed DLNO5s + DLCO5s z-scores consistently outperformed individual metrics. The combined model improved MCC by 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.11) and NRI by 37% (95% CI 13 to 62%) over DLCO5s alone. The top model summed DLNO5s + DLCO5s model explained 10% of fixed and 59% of random variance. DLCO5s alone failed to identify reduced membrane diffusion in approximately 16% of cases. Dyspnoea severity was significantly associated with all diffusion indices (p<0.001), though combined scores showed no stronger correlation than single predictors. Summed DLNO5s + DLCO5s z-scores enhance classification of post-COVID-19 pulmonary impairment beyond DLCO5s alone. The NO-CO double diffusion approach offers improved diagnostic discrimination between previously infected individuals and controls and aligns with symptom severity. These findings support broader clinical integration of combined diffusion metrics in post-COVID assessment.",

    "abstract": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the risk of the outbreak of new emerging infectious diseases remained constantly present. As such an outbreak can have devastating consequences to the society and economy, development of warning strategies before it takes place is a critical and urgent research task. However, there are currently no validated methods that are both effective and practically feasible for giving pre-outbreak alerts. As such, timely identification and rapid response after an outbreak takes place is still a feasible and effective method for responding to new emerging infectious diseases. The speed and efficiency of the response are largely contingent upon preparedness during the inter-epidemic periods. This paper aims to outline our thinking about the framework for infectious disease early warning and propose some recommendations. Implementation of such a strategy in practice necessitates the establishment of pilot initiatives to test the early warning system according to our proposed principles. These pilots may use severe influenza or hypothetical outbreak scenarios as examples, define warning signals, develop the mechanisms for epidemiological investigation, reporting and response so as to conduct feasibility assessments. 虽然新型冠状病毒感染大流行已经结束，但新发烈性传染病暴发流行的风险持续存在，且一旦发生将会造成巨大的社会经济影响。因此，新发传染病预警是一项十分重要且紧迫的研究任务。在新发传染病暴发前作出预警，对社会的冲击最小。因此，任何暴发前预警的尝试都值得探索。然而，目前尚没有证实有效、切实可行的暴发前预警方法，暴发后的快速确认和应对，仍是目前应对新发传染病的关键，行动的速度和有效性则取决于平时的准备。本文旨在围绕传染病预警的总体方向和路线，提出并论证暴发后快速应对的策略。如何在实践中实现这个机制，还需要依据有关原理，建立预警机制的试验基地，以严重型流感等疾病或假设案例作为预警对象，明确预警信号，构建初步的流行病学调查、上报和应对机制，展开深入的可行性研究。.",

    "abstract": "Despite the decreasing cases, SARS-CoV-2, with its endemic status, still threatens public health, and developing a variant-proof vaccine could be a promising strategy to prevent future infection. In this study, utilizing immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology, we aimed to develop a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine with high population coverage, targeting multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2. To design a multivariant vaccine, 20,567 sequences consisting of all SARS-CoV-2's variants of concern whole genome were retrieved. Utilizing an immunoinformatics approach, the selected antigens spike and nucleocapsid proteins were analyzed to predict linear B lymphocyte (LBL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. These epitopes were evaluated based on antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, conservancy, and coverage at both global and Indonesian levels. The identified epitopes were further subjected to molecular docking analysis with MHC molecules and combined into the design of a multi-epitope vaccine. The validated 3D structure of the vaccine construct (VC) was used in molecular docking with TLR4 and BCR. The vaccine construct's potential in eliciting immune responses was also assessed. The predicted epitopes demonstrated extensive population coverage, encompassing 99.99% of the global population and 99.39% of the Indonesian population, respectively. The selected epitopes consisted of four LBL, five HTL, and three CTL epitopes were combined using linkers to make a multi-epitope construct, which was antigenic, non-allergenic, 257 amino acids long, and most of the structure was coil (61.87%). Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed potent interactions between the validated 3D structure and the TLR4 and BCR receptors, while molecular dynamic simulations confirmed the stability of the VC-TLR4 and VC-BCR complexes. Additionally, mRNA codon optimization was performed to enhance vaccine expression efficiency, and secondary structure analysis indicated that the designed mRNA vaccine possessed a stable conformation. As a result, an mRNA vaccine candidate was obtained with high population coverage and could induce a robust and protective immune response against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, further studies are required to validate the safety and efficacy of the proposed vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In silico experiments also demonstrated possible SARS-CoV-2 binding to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) during cell entry. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is involved in the SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion process. To study expression and activity profiles of implicated enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 infection in various age groups of both genders and discuss the possible impact of this on COVID-19 outcome. Saliva from different age groups was used to profile MMP-2 and gelatinase enzymes by zymography. Enzyme activities resulting from the cleavage of the H-Arg-Pro-pNA substrate were measured using a microplate reader. ACE2 transcription and translation were quantified using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Statistical analysis was used to identify the presence of significant differences. Zymography demonstrated different gelatinase activities in a range of ∼180-30 kDa and showed distinct bands at ∼96, 72, 66, 60, and 40 kDa. Comparing MMP-2, DPP-4, DPP-4/ACE2 activities, ACE2 protein, and mRNA levels between genders showed p-values of 0.0142, 0.1056, 0.1859, 0.6411, and 0.4797, whereas correlations with age showed correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.1377, 0.4185, 0.0597, -0.0993, and -0.0073, respectively. The r values between ACE2 protein and ACE2 mRNA with DPP-4 activity were -0.0668 and 0.1935, respectively. The values between both DPP-4 activity and ACE2 protein with MMP-2 activity were -0.0506 and 0.0898, respectively. Results reflected (1) MMP-2 activity is higher among males. (2) DPP-4 activity positively correlates with age. (3) Gender differences in DPP-4 activity, ACE2 protein, and mRNA levels were not statistically significant. (4) Age differences in MMP-2 activity, ACE2 expression were not significant. (5) Inter-enzyme correlations were not observed. The differential activity of both MMP-2 and DPP-4 highlights their potential as risk factors for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in males and older groups.",

    "abstract": "The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 d postinfection (dpi), and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and periairway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.",

Mothers (n = 304) reporting their ACEs, depressive symptoms in pregnancy and 6-months postpartum, and their children's socioemotional problems at 15-, 24-, and 35- months postpartum. Latent growth curve parallel and serial mediation analyses indicated that higher maternal ACEs were significantly associated with greater perinatal depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy, but not 6-months postpartum, were associated with higher average socioemotional problems at each time point. Maternal ACEs were indirectly associated with average socioemotional problems through prenatal, but not postpartum, depressive symptoms. Indirect effects from maternal ACEs to socioemotional problem trajectories were not significant. Findings suggest that prenatal depressive symptoms should be further explored as a mechanism through which maternal ACEs impact early socioemotional problems.",

Qualitative investigation of a multimethod pragmatic clinical trial designed to develop and test a novel cohorting intervention to mitigate infection transmission in SNFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a purposive sample of staff and residents in 2 New York City nonprofit SNFs participating in the intervention trial. We developed a novel cohorting strategy to minimize infection transmission by using infection risk (vaccination or prior infection history) to assign staff to specific residents. We employed a qualitative descriptive approach using content thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with staff and residents to identify themes of acceptability, challenges, and potential impact. Seventy-one staff and 16 residents completed semistructured interviews. Staff and residents supported the intervention. However, both identified challenges, including concerns that switching assignments could lead to staffing issues and care discontinuity. Staff identified communication about the intervention as both a challenge and potential solution, citing a desire for clear and consistent communication across all employees. Staff felt the intervention had potential impact in reducing infection risk fear, promoting effective protective equipment usage, and encouraging more interaction and less isolation than standard prevention practices. We developed a novel and acceptable preventive strategy that may increase residents' flexibility and reduce their isolation as well as staff stress. Clear, consistent, and proactive communication may improve intervention acceptability and perceptions about impact. Similar infection-control protocols might be adapted for different long-term care infection risks. Communication at all staffing levels and with residents is essential to ensure the intervention is acceptable to both. Future trials could include social isolation and staff burnout as potential outcomes.",

Accurate diagnosis of these viruses using cost-effective methods is important, especially for asymptomatic cases. Diagnostic differentiation between naturally occurring antibodies and other antibodies is an area that requires investigation.

A total of 120 sera were collected at two stages (62 samples for the pilot experiment during coronavirus pandemic, and 58 samples were collected recently). An ELISA test was developed using cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 150 (pp150) and herpes simplex virus 2 glycoprotein D (HSV-2 gD) to test the specificity of the test. The cutoff value was 0.218, which indicates low background noise. There was competitive binding of the CMVpp150 as competitor compared to HSV-2 gD. The test can be reliably used to specifically determine anti-viral immunodominant proteins. Future studies should explore the binding of antibodies to other specific viral antigens to further expand the scale of testing. Furthermore, studies should be performed to reproduce these results with comparability using commercial kits.",

    "abstract": "In Manitoba, Canada, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery included, but was not limited to, disruption of many routine health care services, and the rapid introduction of both social distancing and virtual care. Little was known about how COVID-19-related changes to cancer care delivery would impact patient satisfaction with care and care coordination. This report aims to present and interpret findings of an online survey of people with oncology-related conditions in Manitoba, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring patient satisfaction and care coordination. A link to an online survey was made available to patients receiving cancer treatment in Manitoba, Canada, between July 31, 2020, and February 28, 2022. The survey included validated patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) for patient satisfaction and care coordination. Analysis included the generation of descriptive statistics and logistic regression, including univariate and multivariate analysis using stepwise model building. The survey results were interpreted using fit theory as a theoretical lens. A total of 203 responses were collected, of which 154 had completed responses for all PREM measures and were included in the analysis. Response rate is estimated at 3.3%-2.0%. The average age was 65 (SD 11.7) years. Most respondents were male (n=79, 52.7%). Most respondents were being treated with curative intent (n=81, 53.6%). The most common type of cancer was breast (n=41, 26.6%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that ages 60-69 years were associated with above average patient satisfaction (OR 2.205, 95% CI 1.045-4.624; P=.04). Age <60 years (OR 0.437, 95% CI 0.204-0.934; P=.03) and European Cooperative Group functional status (ECOG) ≥2 (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.137-0.782; P=.01) were associated with below average patient satisfaction. Age <60 years, ECOG ≥2, and hematological cancer were selected through stepwise multivariate model building, resulting in an explanatory model (R2=0.129) of patient satisfaction. ECOG ≥2 was associated with below-average care coordination (OR 0.357, 95% CI 0.145-0.880; P=.03), and was the only identified predictor of care coordination, with no explanatory multivariate model generated. Fit theory supports that the level of patient satisfaction and care coordination in each population subset inversely reflects a relative level of unmet supportive care need. Survey respondents with poor functional status, those outside the 60-69 years age range, and those with nonhematological malignancies likely experience increased unmet supportive care needs compared with their counterparts. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings reflect transient phenomena related to the COVID-19 pandemic, selection biases associated with the survey method used, or underlying health care delivery inequities.",

    "abstract": "Digital health interventions (DHIs) refer to the use of information and communication technologies to support or facilitate the achievement of health objectives. The Government of India has launched various DHIs at the primary health care level to improve health services and health-seeking behaviors. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of implementing these interventions and the user response from target end-users within the government health system setting. This study aimed to assess the implementation status of DHIs and the user response of target end users, that is, the general population and health care workers (HCWs), in health and wellness centers (HWCs) in Chandigarh, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the implementation status of 9 DHIs: the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), Reproductive and Child Health (RCH), Health Management Information System (HMIS), HWC portal, Comprehensive Primary Health Care-Noncommunicable Disease (CPHC-NCD), Family Planning-Logistics Management Information System (FP-LMIS), eSanjeevani, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program-Integrated Health Information Program (IDSP-IHIP) portal, Aarogya Setu, and the COVID-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) app. Data were collected from 4 purposively selected HWCs using a pretested data extraction form and observation checklist from June to September 2022. The implementation status of these DHIs was evaluated by categorizing indicators into input, process, and output components and estimating cumulative percentage scores using a score-based logic model framework. Pretested interview schedules were used to assess awareness and user response of DHIs among 120 target end users (clients visiting HWCs) and 120 HCWs (auxiliary nurse midwives, data entry operators, and medical officers). The prevalence of user response was then estimated. The implementation status scores of the eVIN and RCH portals ranged from 70% to 90%. The HMIS portal, HWC portal, CPHC-NCD portal, and FP-LMIS scored between 25% and 50%, while eSanjeevani and the IDSP-IHIP portal scored between 51% and 70%. Community awareness of DHIs was poor, ranging from 1% to 18.3%, except for Aarogya Setu (94/120, 78.3%) and the CoWIN app (43/120, 35.8%), despite 86.7% (104/120) of participants having access to a mobile phone. Low awareness of DHIs was significantly associated with lower socioeconomic status (P=.02) and lower education levels (P=.04). In total, 66% (80/120) of HCWs reported that working with DHIs was easy; however, 89.2% (107/120) stated that dual data entry increased their workload. Frequent technical glitches were most commonly reported for the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife OnLine app (78/80, 97%) by HCWs. Help desk or feedback options in DHIs were rarely used by auxiliary nurse midwives/multipurpose workers (0%-3.8%). The RCH and eVIN portals were effectively implemented, eSanjeevani was moderately implemented, while the HMIS, HWC portal, CPHC, and FP-LMIS were poorly implemented. Community awareness of DHIs was low, except for the Aarogya Setu and CoWIN apps. Although HCWs found DHIs easy to use, increased workload due to dual data entry and frequent technical issues was a key concern.",

To evaluate the efficacy of intradermal INCO on skin quality in women with maskne. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 36 women with maskne received intradermal INCO (20 U) or placebo (2:1) in the mid and lower face. Skin roughness (SEr), sebum level, pore size, and erythema index were measured over 112 days using biophysical tools. Patient and expert assessments were recorded via Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS). Thirty-three participants completed the study. The INCO group showed significantly greater SEr improvement than placebo on days 28, 56, 84, and 112. Sebum level decreased significantly by day 28 (-19.27 μg/cm2 vs. +1.27 μg/cm2 in placebo; p < 0.001). Pore size differed significantly at days 28 and 56. Erythema decreased in both groups, with greater reduction in the INCO group (-43.81 vs. -3.27; p = 0.041). Both patients and investigators reported improved skin quality in the treatment group. Intradermal injection of INCO represents a promising approach for managing mask-associated skin conditions (\"maskne\"). While further investigations are necessary to fully establish its benefits, the present study offers encouraging evidence supporting its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Prone positioning is a cornerstone in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including COVID-19-related ARDS. However, alternative positioning strategies such as reverse Trendelenburg position (RTP) have received limited attention. The objective is to evaluate the physiological effects of RTP on lung aeration using lung ultrasound (LUS) in a patient with severe COVID-19 ARDS. We performed serial LUS assessments across 12 lung regions in a mechanically ventilated ARDS patient undergoing three different positional changes: Trendelenburg, flat supine/prone, and reverse Trendelenburg. LUS scores were used to quantify regional aeration and global lung aeration. Oxygenation parameters were monitored in parallel. RTP was associated with a reduction in global LUS score (from 21 to 17), indicating improved lung aeration, particularly in the superior and posterior regions. Oxygenation improved concurrently, with increases in peripheral and central venous oxygen saturations. No significant change in lung compliance was observed. This case demonstrates that RTP may facilitate redistribution of extravascular lung water and improve aeration in select lung regions. LUS offers a dynamic, noninvasive method to assess and guide individualized positioning strategies in ARDS. These findings support further exploration of vertical positioning as an adjunct in ARDS management when prone positioning is not feasible.",

The monomeric S protein exposed less accessible regions within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) \"inner face\" and \"NTD face\" and subdomains 1, eliciting a diverse array of bnAbs against various Omicron subvariants. Notably, antibodies targeting the conserved RBD inner face, such as 4A5, showed potent neutralization across all tested variants. Structural analyses provide insights into the broad protectiveness of these vaccine-elicited nAbs. This study underscores the potential of bivalent vaccines with monomeric spike proteins to confer broad-spectrum immunity, offering a promising direction for future SARS-CoV-2 universal vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) and COVID-19 are prominent respiratory pathogens with overlapping clinical presentations, including fever, cough, and sore throat, posing significant diagnostic challenges without viral testing. Tongue image diagnosis, a noninvasive method used in traditional Chinese medicine, has shown correlations with specific respiratory infections, but its application remains underexplored in differentiating HAdVs from COVID-19. Advances in artificial intelligence offer opportunities to enhance tongue image analysis for more objective and accurate diagnostics. This study aims to develop and validate artificial intelligence-based predictive models using tongue image features to differentiate COVID-19 from adenoviral respiratory infections, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and integrating traditional diagnostic methods with modern medical technologies. A total of 280 tongue images were collected from 58 patients with COVID-19, 84 patients with HAdVs, and 30 healthy controls. Deep learning methods were applied to extract tongue features, including color, coating, fissures, papillae, tooth marks, and granules. Four machine learning classifiers, logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting model, and extreme gradient boosting, were developed to differentiate COVID-19 and HAdV infections. The key features identified by the machine learning algorithms were further visualized in a 2D space. Nine tongue features showed significant differences among groups (all P<.05), including coating color (red, green, and blue), presence of tooth marks, coating crack ratio, moisture level, texture directionality, roughness, and contrast. The extreme gradient boosting model achieved the highest diagnostic performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) and an area under the precision-recall curve above 0.70. Shapley additive explanations analysis indicated tongue color, moisture, and texture as key contributors. Our findings demonstrate the potential of tongue diagnosis in identifying pathogens responsible for acute respiratory tract infections at the time of admission. This approach holds significant clinical implications, offering the potential to reduce clinician workloads while improving diagnostic accuracy and the overall quality of medical care.",

However, only one third of reproductive-age individuals are up to date on recommended vaccinations. Pregnant individuals often receive recommended vaccines during prenatal care, but limited research has investigated if prenatal care can also provide opportunities to increase vaccination rates among non-birthing partners/co-parents. We administered an anonymous survey to outpatient prenatal care providers, including Obstetricians, Family Medicine physicians, Certified Nurse Midwives, and Nurse Practitioners, to assess practice patterns and opinions regarding vaccine counseling and in-office vaccination for the non-birthing partners of pregnant patients. Of the 200 obstetric providers surveyed, 112 responded (56%). Of these, 42% (n=77) reported counseling non-birthing partners on vaccine recommendations less than half the time. Only 4% (n=4) of respondents report vaccinating non-birthing partners who are not already patients in their practice. Nearly half of providers who do not offer non-birthing partner vaccination had never considered the practice (46%, n=44). The majority of respondents desired more education on non-birthing partner vaccination (58%, n=55). Respondents identified multiple implementation barriers to vaccinating non-birthing partners, including difficulties with registration, staffing, and time constraints. If barriers were addressed, 68% (n=65) of providers expressed willingness to incorporate non-birthing partner vaccination into their practice. This study demonstrates willingness of key stakeholders to incorporate non-birthing partner vaccination into prenatal care, a unique mechanism to increase parental vaccination rates and protect neonates from vaccine-preventable illness.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers had imperfect information and faced resource constraints (i.e., vaccine availability). Public health decisions at the time may not have been optimal for minimizing disease burden. Here, we perform counterfactual evaluations of the impact of various vaccination strategies in Québec (Canada) on the COVID-19 burden from March 2020 to November 2021. In particular, we evaluate the effect of alternative age-specific prioritization sequences of vaccine dose roll-out and assess the impacts of vaccine hesitancy. To achieve this, we develop and calibrate a deterministic, compartmental dynamic transmission model, stratified according to age, susceptibility to infection, viral variant, and issue-specific immunity. The initial conditions and parameters of the model are obtained through a combination of population-based surveillance data and Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) parameter estimation methods. We find that, using our calibrated model, the vaccination prioritization policies implemented at the start of the pandemic, where age groups at highest risk were sequentially prioritized, was only outperformed by prioritizing the vaccination of younger, more socially connected groups together with higher-risk individuals aged 50+ (3% fewer hospitalizations compared to the baseline strategy). These results hold when we account for vaccine hesitancy. Specifically, we generally observe the fewest hospitalizations for the optimal strategies at the highest uptake rates (i.e. with the least vaccine refusal). However, certain sub-optimal strategies show higher hospitalization rates for higher vaccine uptake as a result of reduced vaccine dose redistribution to more interconnected age groups. Overall, our findings illustrate how the impact of vaccination strategies depends on population factors (e.g. contact patterns, vaccine uptake, and degree of immunity), age-specific risk of severe disease and transmission dynamics. Understanding these dependencies are important for guiding future decision-making related to priority vaccine administration in the face of known and emerging pathogens and potential shortage of doses.",

COVID-19 infection may lead to increased cancer risk, as seen with other viruses, or to decreased risk due to the activation of the immune response during acute infection. This study aimed to determine the association between cancer incidence in US Veterans and COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US Veterans comparing those who tested positive for COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19 between March 15, 2020, and Nov 30, 2020, to those who tested negative. We used data from the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource and Cox proportional hazard regression models to determine the hazard ratio of a new cancer diagnosis within a three-year follow-up period for the COVID-19 positive patients compared to those who were negative. Covariates included age, race, ethnicity, sex, BMI, smoking, being an active patient in the VHA system within a year of the COVID-19 test, and other factors. 499,396 patients were included in this study, with 88590 (17.2%) COVID-19 positive, 427566 (82.8%) COVID-19 negative. The ages of the COVID-19 positive and negative patients were 57.9 ± 16.4 and 59.5 ± 15.8, respectively.

The reduction of the hazard was similar across sexes and races, except in Asians. Above 45 years of age, the hazard of cancer incidence further decreased with advancing age. Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic had a decreased risk of cancer incidence in a 3-year follow-up across gender and race.

Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-tomography can produce 3D data of larger volumes with isotropic, albeit typically lower resolution.

However, compared to the previously mentioned techniques, these techniques come at the cost of much lower resolution along the Z-axis of the sample. A technique that provides 3D information of samples up to 1 µm thickness with isotropic resolution of a few nanometers is scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography. Here, we present a protocol for the preparation of high-pressure frozen, freeze-substituted, and resin-embedded virological specimens and their analysis using STEM tomography. This protocol benefits from the advantages of room temperature imaging while preserving the biological ultrastructure in a near-native state. We show two representative examples for questions that can be answered using STEM tomography. First, we apply the protocol for studying virion morphogenesis of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The STEM tomograms offer information on recombinant VSV budding that is otherwise not accessible by 2D imaging. Second, we show correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) using Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and STEM tomography (FRET-3D-CLEM) of EF-C peptide nanofibrils. This recently published combination gives new insights into the uptake and disassembly of infection-enhancing peptide nanofibrils, especially profiting from the large volume that is accessible by STEM tomography.",

    "title": "Community volunteer participation and its determinants during respiratory infectious disease outbreaks in China: A cross-sectional study across multiple provinces.",
    "abstract": "Community volunteering plays a crucial role in strengthening public health emergency response, particularly during respiratory infectious disease outbreaks. However, limited research has examined the extent of resident participation and the factors influencing engagement in such efforts. This study investigated the prevalence and determinants of community volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infectious disease outbreaks in China. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey and included data from 1,023 residents residing in five provinces in China (Beijing, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Hubei, and Yunnan) between early 2020 and March 2023. Participants reported their sociodemographic factors, volunteer activities, related motivations and barriers during the pandemic. We used logistic regression models to identify factors associated with volunteering. Of the respondents, 65.9% participated in community volunteering during the pandemic, with the most common roles related to nucleic acid testing. The primary motivation for volunteering was value expression. Main barriers to participation included a lack of time, limited professional skills, and concerns about the risk of infection. Higher odds of participation were observed among respondents who held at least a bachelor's degree (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.21-5.48), worked in community (AOR = 4.32, 95% CI: 2.56-7.28) or health‑care roles (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.31-4.67), were Communist Party members (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.07-2.64), or had volunteered regularly before 2020 (AOR = 3.02, 95% CI: 2.51-3.64), while single/divorced/widowed individuals had lower odds of participation (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94) (all p < 0.05). Community volunteering could constitute a substantial auxiliary workforce during respiratory epidemics in China. Integrating volunteers into emergency preparedness may require institutionalized training programs, transparent management structures, as well as legal and policy safeguards that recognize volunteers' contributions and mitigate perceived risks. Such measures are likely to strengthen community resilience in future public‑health emergencies.",

This bibliometric analysis explored the research landscape of digitally-supported interventions, focusing on models, effectiveness, and future directions. A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection (2019-2024) was conducted, combining bibliometric mapping with thematic analysis. Four thematic clusters emerged: (1) Digital Psychiatry and m-Health Applications, (2) Simulation and VR in Nursing Education, (3) Telemedicine and Mental Health in the COVID-19 Era, and (4) Foundational Concepts of Digital Mental Health. m-Health applications were central themes, while telemedicine's role was crucial during the pandemic. The study highlights the importance of digital technologies, especially m-health, in psychiatric nursing and underscores the need to enhance nurses' digital skills and develop effective nurse-led interventions. The analysis also identifies critical research gaps concerning clinically meaningful outcomes, cost-effectiveness, transferability, and patient/provider experiences.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with increased diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and a rise in psychiatric hospitalizations in children and youth in Canada. The collateral effects of the pandemic on children and youth have been well documented in many domains. However, the impact of pandemic restrictions in child and youth psychiatric inpatient milieux has been largely ignored. This study aimed to understand youth and families' experiences of inpatient psychiatric hospitalization in Canada during the height of the pandemic (2020-2022). We conducted focus groups with youth and family members. Our findings highlight that youth and their kin experienced multiple forms of deprivation, including physical isolation and separation from family. Participants were unanimous in reporting that quality of care was significantly compromised, which they felt led to poorer outcomes. We reflect on the challenges of preserving the relational components of care in a time of crisis, the carcerality of COVID-19 isolation practices, and how the turn toward risk management culture was met with resistance and distrust by youth and their families. We discuss how many findings are reflective of trends in inpatient care overall, not only in times of crisis, and suggest that COVID-19 may have brought into focus fault lines that require a rethinking of child and youth inpatient practices. Nonetheless, the insights from this study can help with guiding policy in future crises, including involving children and families in policy development, reducing potentially traumatizing practices of quarantine and isolation, and maintaining flexibility when applying restrictive regulations to youth mental health patients.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to offer valuable insights into crisis management and risk communication, particularly through retrospective analyses that allow a more comprehensive understanding. Emotional responses played a crucial role in shaping how individuals processed information and built trust in different objects in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate how negative emotions influence online information engagement and trust in 4 distinct entities: government, scientists, health care providers, and other people (relatives, friends, family, and strangers). A nationwide survey was conducted in China from January 31 to February 9, 2020, involving 1568 adult participants. The data collection was particularly valuable due to the limited access to national samples in China during the early stages of the public health crisis. Participants were asked questions related to negative emotions, engagement with online information, and their trust in 4 different entities (government, scientists, other people, and health care providers) during the pandemic. Mediation analyses were performed to test the associations between the examined variables. A 95% bootstrap CI approach was used to estimate the mediation effects. This study reveals that negative emotions not only had a direct effect on trust but also indirectly fostered trust in the government and scientists through increased information engagement. There was a positive association (B=0.219, SE 0.023; P<.001) between negative emotions and information engagement. In addition, individuals experiencing more negative emotions tended to trust more in the government (B=0.191, SE 0.022; P<.001) and scientists (B=0.184, SE 0.017; P<.001). However, this effect did not extend to trust in health care providers or interpersonal trust. The research findings reveal that while negative emotions directly and indirectly enhanced trust in the government and scientists through increased information engagement, they did not significantly impact trust in health care providers or interpersonal relationships in the Chinese context. These findings highlight the different pathways through which emotions and information behaviors affect trust during public health crises, offering critical lessons for future public health emergencies and risk communication.",

Secondary data from government reports, and peer-reviewed articles were also analyzed to contextualize the findings. This study focuses on narrative reporting without formal data analysis.ResultsHealthcare professionals utilized telehealth and/or telerehabilitation services for follow-ups, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, nursing care and other rehabilitation services (home modifications, peer counseling, and yoga). Commonly tools included WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Zoom and other video conferencing softwares. Barriers included poor internet connectivity, lack of standardized teleassessments and tele protocols, reimbursement issues, legal and privacy concerns.ConclusionsTelehealth and/or Telerehabilitation services have demonstrated their critical role in SCI care during COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs, offering ways to connect and maintain continuity of care through commonly used social media tools. To integrate telehealth as a viable and long-term model for future health crises in SCI care, it is essential to develop supportive policies, improve infrastructure, provide professional training, and establish standardized assessment measures and guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic may have had many negative consequences, and yet a lot was left in its wake that could help shape mental health discussions in health care settings in Canada. This paper is shaped by stories told by Filipino nurses working in Northern Ontario. While there is a plethora of studies looking at mental health issues among nurses and other health care professionals in Canadian hospitals, a gap still remains in regard to the experiences of nurses and health care workers in Northern Ontario during COVID-19. This study seeks to look at the differentiated experiences of mental health among health care professionals during and after COVID-19. This qualitative study employs a narrative approach to discuss how neoliberal capitalism, gendered racism, substance use and colonialism shaped mental health outcomes among Filipino health care workers. While many studies have focused on mental health issues among health care providers, there has been minimal focus on race-based trauma and the ways in which substance use is employed to reduce mental health issues to an individual issue, leaving pharmaceutical companies free to boost their profits. This paper employs intersectional analysis to argue for a more comprehensive understanding of mental health issues among health care workers and allow an understanding of a culturally informed perspective to inform health care policies. The result to the study depicts the various forms of race-based trauma faced by Filipino health care workers and the use of over-the-counter medication to navigate themselves through the health care system.

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified disparities, particularly affecting racial/ethnic groups with bleeding disorders. The pilot study aimed to identify key themes related to health equity, diversity, and inclusion as it relates to Black, indigenous people of colour (for example, Native Americans and Asian Pacific Islanders), and Hispanic/Latino people with bleeding disorders (PWBD) by interviewing haemophilia treatment centre (HTC) healthcare providers (HCPs) and a National Bleeding Disorders Foundation (NBDF) chapter executive director. It sought to identify practice gaps, understand the impact of SDOH, and provide an opportunity to propose interventions to address these disparities. NBDF conducted eight interviews with HTC staff members and an NBDF chapter executive director to explore the impact of bleeding disorders on underserved groups. Themes included barriers to care, SDOH influences, and potential interventions. A total of 33 HTC HCPs responded to an anonymous quantitative survey fielded electronically to further validate insights and gather quantitative data. Specialists highlighted pandemic-related challenges, including exacerbated mental health concerns, communication barriers due to language, and transportation issues. These findings underscore the significant impact of SDOH on health care access and outcomes amongst underserved PWBD. The pilot study highlights the need to address access and health care disparities amongst underserved PWBD, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. By addressing SDOH factors, cultural context, and healthcare professionals' bias, HTCs can strive towards equality, equity, and justice, facilitating optimal outcomes for all individuals with bleeding disorders.",

To assess PTG among intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals 4 years after the COVID-19 pandemic and explore its association with resilience, anxiety, and depression. This cross-sectional study invited ICU health care professionals (nursing staff, medical staff [residents, interns, clinical fellows, and senior intensivists], and other professionals providing patient care) in ICUs in general or university-affiliated hospitals in France and Belgium to complete online questionnaires between March 15 and May 15, 2024. PTG, resilience, anxiety, and depression. The primary outcome was PTG, and secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, and resilience. Participants completed validated self-reported questionnaires, including the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10). Visual analog scales (VASs) assessed professional experiences and psychological impact. Multivariate linear regression identified factors associated with PTG. Among 1371 health care professionals in 23 ICUs, 850 (62%) responded (median age, 39 years [IQR, 32-46 years]; 574 [68%] women). The median PTGI score was 50 (IQR, 33-64), with nursing staff reporting higher PTG than medical staff (51 [IQR, 34-65] vs 47 [IQR, 28-61]; P = .02), mainly in personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. Anxiety and depression symptoms were present in 492 respondents (58%) and 219 respondents (26%), respectively. Lower PTG was associated with psychological fatigue (regression coefficient, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.91-1.96; P < .001), ICU conflicts (regression coefficient, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.05-1.19; P = .03), and perceived deterioration in family-centered care (regression coefficient, -7.47; 95% CI, -1.10 to -13.80; P = .02). Higher PTG was correlated with higher resilience (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.17-0.30; P < .001) and was associated with a change in personal life since the pandemic (regression coefficient, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.13-2.47] per VAS point; P < .001). In this cross-sectional study performed 4 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU health care professionals, particularly nursing staff, exhibited significant PTG. Resilience, rather than psychological distress, emerged as a key driver of PTG, and deterioration in family-centered care was a major contributing factor, underscoring the need for targeted well-being and resilience-building strategies to enhance health care professionals' mental health and professional fulfillment while also improving patient and family care.",

This study evaluates the environmental and health risks of healthcare wastewater during the pandemic, focusing on emerging pollutants like microplastics from PPE and pharmaceutical residues. A literature review analyzed the environmental impact, including the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, antimicrobial residues, and microplastics, and explored wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking viral spread and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The review found that traditional wastewater treatments are insufficient for emerging pollutants, while advanced methods like ozonation, nanofiltration, and hybrid approaches offer better removal efficiencies but are hindered by high costs. Cost analysis reveals that some effective methods may not be economically viable in low-resource settings. Future research should enhance treatment efficiency, reduce costs, and explore the long-term impacts of microplastics and pharmaceutical residues. The study highlights the need for robust, cost-effective wastewater management strategies to address the growing environmental and health risks in the post-pandemic era.",

    "abstract": "Research has consistently shown links between parent and child depression. The prevailing assumption is that parent depression precedes the onset, persistence, and even exacerbation of child depression. However, it is plausible, albeit infrequently tested, that child depression triggers subsequent parent depression. Clarifying the direction and developmental timing of these associations is critical for designing and advocating for family-centered approaches to pediatric care. To estimate the longitudinal bidirectional associations between maternal and child depression from middle childhood through emerging adolescence during a period that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess whether these associations are moderated by key sociodemographic factors. This study used data from the All Our Families (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) cohort across multiple waves during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic when children were aged 10.3 (May 20 to July 15, 2020), 10.9 (March 4 to April 30, 2021), 11.6 (November 22, 2021 to January 17, 2022), and 12.8 (January 16 to July 7, 2024) years. Data were analyzed between March 1 and August 31, 2024, using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Maternal and child report of depressive symptoms. The Behavior Assessment System for Children for child depression and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 for maternal depression. The sample included 1801 mother-child dyads (52% boys, 48% girls). Mothers were a mean (SD) 41.6 (4.4) years old at study entry and most had completed postsecondary education (80%), had an annual income more than CAD $100 000 (75%), and were married or in common-law relationships (71.4%). Consistent cross-sectional correlations were observed, reflecting stable between-participant associations for maternal depression and child depression throughout the study period. Within-participant increases in child depression scores at ages 10.3 and 10.9 years were associated with subsequent increases in maternal depression scores at child ages 10.9 (standardized coefficient 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.22) and 11.6 (0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.26) years; however, this was not present for maternal depression. These patterns of associations were moderated by household income (difference test for χ212 = 23.0; P = .03) and within-participant increases in child depression were consistently associated with subsequent increases in maternal depression for the higher income group. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, these findings suggest that children's depression over time may have contributed to worsening maternal depression, rather than the other way around. While these results should be replicated in nonpandemic contexts to confirm their generalizability, they highlight the need for family-centered approaches to mental health care.",

The patient shares her story of resilience up to her AML diagnosis and treatment, through the bone marrow transplant, and then on to the challenges faced as an immunocompromised patient during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The haematologist offers detailed insights into AML and treatment options, including chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. She comments on the challenging journey of her patient, and the complexities of managing immunocompromised patients during the pandemic, who failed to respond sufficiently to vaccination. In addition, she outlines the prophylactic strategy implemented in her centre, and the introduction of alternative immunisation with monoclonal antibodies for this high-risk immunocompromised patient population. This case provides a unique combination of personal patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and medical insights. In this article, a haematologist and her immunocompromised patient discuss the challenges associated with vaccination in highly immunocompromised individuals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following chemotherapy for breast cancer. She describes her AML diagnosis and treatment, and subsequent bone marrow transplant, and how she managed as an immunocompromised person during the pandemic, including the issues associated with COVID-19 vaccination and how these were managed, and her ongoing approaches to protecting herself from infection. The patient’s haematologist outlines the characteristics of AML and the treatment options for the disease, including chemotherapy and allotransplantation, and the immunosuppression that followed the latter. She comments on the experiences of her patient and on the complexities of managing immunocompromised patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly how to manage insufficient response to vaccination. The haematologist describes the COVID-19 vaccination plan implemented by the transplant centre in which she works, and the centre’s introduction of alternative immunisation using a combination of the monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab for high-risk immunocompromised patients. After 5 years of monitoring, the patient is showing signs of recovery from AML. Currently, she does not require immunosuppressant treatment, she is gradually responding to vaccines and her immune function is normalising. This article provides medical insights into the vaccination challenges in highly immunocompromised patients and offers hope for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Background: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, many US youths experience rapid excess weight gain and increase in BMI and obesity prevalence. We leveraged longitudinal electronic health records from three health care organizations in metropolitan Denver, Colorado, to assess COVID-19 pandemic effects on BMI and obesity prevalence. Methods: Using a retrospective cohort of 55,429 children aged 2-19 years, each with ≥3 BMI measurements during 2019-2022, we used mixed-effects regression models to estimate rates of change in BMI and obesity prevalence during prepandemic, early pandemic (March-December 2020), and two later pandemic periods (2021, 2022). Results: The average rate of BMI gain was nearly 70% higher during early pandemic compared to prepandemic [rate ratio (RR): 1.68 (95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.60-1.76)] but attenuated substantially as the pandemic continued [RR: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.34-0.40) for 2021 vs. early pandemic]. This coincided with changes in estimated obesity prevalence from 16% to 17% prepandemic to 21% by December 2020% to 20% by December 2022. School-aged children 6-13 years, those with prepandemic healthy weight, and Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children had the most pronounced BMI increases in early pandemic. Conclusions: Although rates of BMI gain leveled out from early pandemic increases, obesity prevalence in health care-seeking youths in metropolitan Denver remained substantially higher in 2022 than prepandemic, particularly in certain subgroups. Opportunities exist to strengthen institutions and programs that support healthy eating, physical activity, and maintenance of a healthy weight. This work underscores the value of regional surveillance systems to monitor disease trends and inform local efforts to support children's health.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in older adults. During the 2023-2024 respiratory season, Ontario was the first and only province in Canada to launch a publicly funded RSV vaccination program for older adults. A process evaluation of the program was completed to better understand the experiences of the local Public Health Units (PHUs) and long-term care homes (LTCHs) implementing the program. Two process evaluation surveys, one each for PHUs and LTCHs, and a separate immunization coverage survey for LTCHs were distributed. The coverage survey found that 58.5% of residents, among all those living in LTCHs responding to the survey, received the RSV vaccine. Process evaluation surveys found that both PHUs and LTCHs perceived the RSV vaccine to be of lower priority than influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. There was also concordance between PHU and LTCH respondents regarding barriers to program implementation, which included temporary guidance against routine co-administration, a detailed informed consent procedure, and the timing of program roll-out. An additional barrier for LTCH respondents was vaccine hesitancy among staff and residents or their substitute decision makers. Facilitators to program implementation were effective communication with program partners, availability of technical resources, and programmatic supports. These evaluation findings are being shared to assist other jurisdictions in their planning of potential older adult or LTCH vaccination programs, including RSV vaccination. An important consideration for future program implementation is how to improve vaccine confidence in LTCH residents and staff in a rapidly changing vaccine landscape.",

    "title": "False-positive cardiac troponin I values due to macrotroponin in healthy athletes after COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac troponins (cTn) are used to detect and quantify acute cardiomyocyte injury. In patients presenting with symptoms that could indicate myocarditis, elevated cTn concentrations typically mandate cardiac catheterization and heart muscle biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Accordingly, increased cTn levels due to macrotroponin - a complex between patient anti-troponin autoantibodies and cTn - could lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. In athletes, ensuring cardiac health after infection like COVID-19 is critical, but the occurrence of false-positive cTn levels post-COVID-19 remains unknown. This observational study prospectively included 35 healthy athletes (aged 16-75 years; 19 females, 16 males) who underwent post-COVID check-ups during 2022-2023. Athletes' cTn levels were measured using four different hs-cTn routine immunoassays. If discrepancies were noted between assays, further testing for macrotroponin was conducted using protein G column, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and anti-troponin autoantibody immunoassay. Seventeen athletes had normal cTn levels across all assays, while 18 (51 %) had elevated cTn, mostly cTnI. Despite elevated cTn levels, no signs of myocarditis or other cardiac conditions were found on electrocardiography, echocardiography, or CMR. Macrotroponin was confirmed among 16 of these 18 athletes. Further, IgG anti-troponin autoantibodies correlated significantly with the levels of the two most-commonly affected assays: hs-cTnI-Siemens Atellica and hs-cTnI-Abbott Alinity. Post-COVID-19, nearly half of athletes showed elevated cTnI levels due to interference from macrotroponin. Awareness among physicians and laboratorians of this analytical confounder can avoid unnecessary invasive or costly diagnostic tests in athletes with false-positive cTnI levels after COVID-19.",

    "title": "Countdown 2030: Trends in neonatal mortality between 1990 and 2023 with projections towards sustainable development goal target 3.2 at the global, regional, and national levels.",
    "abstract": "In 2015, the UN General Assembly set Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in which SDG 3.2 called for all countries to reach a neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births by 2030. As the SDG era enters its final years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is time to take stock of worldwide trends in terms of neonatal mortality and progress towards SDG target 3.2. We aimed to evaluate the time trends in neonatal mortality from 1990 to 2023 with projections towards SDG target 3.2 at the global, regional, and national levels. Annual neonatal deaths and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) between 1990 and 2023 at the global, regional, and national levels were collected from a dataset complied by the UN Inter-agency group for Child Mortality Estimation. The percentage changes in neonatal deaths and the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) in NMRs at the global, regional, and national levels were calculated. The year in which the location with an NMR above 12 deaths per 1000 live births would achieve the SDG 3.2 NMR target was estimated using time series analyses. Globally, the number of neonatal deaths decreased by 56.42% from 5.241 million in 1990 to 2.28 million in 2023 and the NMR decreased by an average of 2.54% (95% CI: 2.44%, 2.63%) per year from 36.70 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 17.33 deaths per 1000 live births in 2023. The global NMR is expected to achieve SDG target 3.2 by 2036. At the regional level, the NMR decreased significantly in all SDG regions between 1990 and 2023 but remained above SDG target 3.2 in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southern Asia, and Western Asia and Northern Africa, with NMRs of 26.41, 20.74, and 12.80 deaths per 1000 live births in 2023, respectively. Sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia are projected to reach the SDG 3.2 target by 2068 and 2041, respectively. At the national level, the NMR increased significantly in Dominica (EAPC = 3.95; 95% CI: 3.74, 4.17), Botswana (EAPC = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.70), Grenada (EAPC = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.63), and Eswatini (EAPC = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.44) between 1990 and 2023. Among the 200 countries and territories worldwide, 125 have already met SDG target 3.2, and 7 are expected to do so by 2030. Of the remaining 68 countries that would not achieve SDG target 3.2 by 2030, 11 would meet it between 2031 and 2040, 12 would meet it between 2041 and 2050, and 37 would meet it after 2050, if the average rate of decline from 1990 to 2023 continues; however, the NMR would be deteriorating in Dominica, Botswana, Grenada, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Dominican Republic, and Fiji. Despite substantial progress in reducing the NMR worldwide since 1990, more than a quarter of countries and territories would miss SDG target 3.2 by 2030, and nearly half of those countries and territories would meet SDG target 3.2 after 2050. Urgent actions are needed in most regions and countries with high NMRs, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa.",

In this study, participants aged 18-75 years with no prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination history were enrolled to receive the CoronaVac vaccine. The interval between the first and second vaccine doses was 28 days, while the third dose was given 6 months after the second. Between February 1 to 15 February 2022, we recruited 40 eligible participants who had not received any COVID-19 vaccination and had no prior COVID-19 infection. After the third dose, neutralizing antibody levels significantly increased against the ancestral strain and certain Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.4/5, BF.7). Compared to levels observed 28 days post-second dose, neutralizing antibody levels rose further 28 days after the third dose, with the GMFI against the ancestral strain at 1.69 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.20). Among other variants, the GMFI against Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.4/5, BF.7) exceeded that for Beta and Delta, with the highest GMFI recorded for the BA.4/5 variant at 4.97 (95% CI: 3.08, 8.05). The necessity of the third booster dose lies in its ability to enhance the breadth of the immune response.",

    "abstract": "No data exists on responses to mRNA vaccines in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with HIV. We compared these responses in HIV-positive (HIV+KTR+) and negative KTRs (HIV-KTR+), and in people living with HIV (PLWH) without kidney transplantation (HIV+KTR-). In across-sectional study of 33 patients receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we evaluated the humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination using a Luminex platform (IgG and IgM), and cellular response with specific T cell response (S-and N- protein) by ELISpot. We used logistic regression models to assess associated factors. The study comprised 11 HIV-KTR+, 11 HIV+KTR+, and 11 HIV+KTR-. PLWH had suppressed viral load on ART. Seroconversion rates were 72.7% among KTRs, with no significant differences between HIV-KTR+ (81.8%) and HIV+KTR+ (63.6%) (P = 0.338). In HIV+KTR-, seroconversion was 100%, higher than HIV+KTR+ (P = 0.027). Cellular response against protein S occurred in 63.6% of cases, regardless of HIV, transplantation, or dose number. Higher age negatively influenced cellular response in HIV+KTR- (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.60-0.99). Although cellular immune response was similar across all groups, humoral response was reduced in HIV+KTR+. In HIV+KTR-, age reduced cellular response. These findings enhance our understanding of vaccine response in immunosuppressed populations and aid in optimizing vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other lethal coronaviruses has prompted extensive research into targeted antiviral treatments, particularly focusing on the viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) due to its essential role for viral replication. However, the rise of drug resistance mutations poses threats to public health and underscores the need to predict resistance mutations and understand the mechanism of how these mutations confer resistance. The binding of inhibitor to 3CLpro drives it from the monomeric to the active dimeric form, which can counterintuitively lead to enzyme activation rather than inhibition. Furthermore, we find this allosteric coupling between binding and dimerization is sensitive to mutation, leading to a new mechanism for drug resistance. Understanding the relationship between inhibitor binding and dimerization is important for resistant strain surveillance and development of robust antivirals. Herein, we present a systematic study of drug resistance mediated by inhibitor-induced dimerization of 3CLpro.",

    "abstract": "In Rhode Island, drug overdose deaths increased by 28% in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as compared with the previous year (2019), mirroring national trends. We explored how the spatial distribution of overdose deaths overlapped with that of COVID-19 cases to identify levels and increased prevalence of these health issues among census tracts in Rhode Island. We used data from the Rhode Island Department of Health and the US Census Bureau to calculate annualized COVID-19 case rates (from March 20, 2020, through December 31, 2021) and unintentional overdose death rates by census tract (from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021). We used bivariate cluster analyses to group census tracts into clusters of high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high overdose deaths and COVID-19 case rates per 100 000 population. Clusters with high overdose death rates and high COVID-19 case rates were identified in urban census tracts around the capital city of Providence, whereas clusters with low overdose death rates and low COVID-19 case rates were identified in the state's southern census tracts. Structural factors differed among cluster groups: cluster groups with high overdose death rates and high COVID-19 case rates had greater percentages of households with overcrowding (mean [SD] = 1.6% [1.0%]), people living below the federal poverty level (17.5% [7.4%]), and people with a high school degree or less (37.8% [7.8%]) than the other cluster groups. Targeted investments in community-led and place-based public health interventions can be used to address underlying social and structural determinants of health (eg, overcrowding, poverty, low education levels) in communities with high rates of overdose deaths and COVID-19 cases.",

    "abstract": "Sufficient laboratory capacity is vital to containing infectious diseases outbreaks. This study was conducted to document the strategies adopted to scale up laboratory testing capacity during Nigeria's response to COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional descriptive study adopted a mixed method approach including desk reviews and key informant interviews (KIIs). The KIIs were conducted among actors of the COVID-19 response teams in states and federal ministries of health in Nigeria. At the beginning of the pandemic in Nigeria, testing performance was poor, but this improved over time. To manage the demand for testing, Nigeria adopted targeted testing with a focus on symptomatic contacts,alerts, and returning travelers from high-risk countries who were symptomatic during the quarantine period.. Strategies to enhance laboratory capacity and improve the turnaround time for results included leveraging on existing tuberculosis laboratory networks or building new laboratories where none existed; decentralization of sample collection and testing; staff health workers repurposing and hiring of volunteers; training and retraining of laboratory personnel; adoption of rapid diagnostic testing; and strengthening public-private partnerships. From an initial three laboratories with capacity to test for SARSCoV- 2 in February, 2020, the number of laboratories increased to 158 by March, 2022. Although laboratory capacity increased, logistics and supply chain disruption were still a challenge. Investment in local manufacturing capacities of laboratory consumables such as RDTs and reagents would promote self-reliance and sustainability for a country as populous as Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of meteorological factors on the incidence and multi-route transmission dynamics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Jiangsu Province, China, during the pre-COVID-19 era (2005-2018), and to develop predictive models for informing public health interventions. A dual-model study integrating the Multi-Host and Multi-Route Transmission Dynamic Model (MHMRTDM) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was employed to quantify meteorological impacts on multi-route HEV transmission. HEV incidence data (2005-2018) and meteorological variables from provincial and national agencies were analyzed. The MHMRTDM quantified transmission rate coefficients (β, β w and β p'). GAMs linked the transmission coefficients and incidence to meteorological factors, validated using 2017-2018 data. The optimal GAM integrated with the MHMRTDM was established (lowest GCV = 1.705 × 10-21, R 2 = 0.980, lowest RMSE = 3.682 × 10-11, lowest MAE = 2.987 × 10-11). Analysis of four dependent variables (incidence, β, β w and β p') revealed distinct climate-driven patterns: (1) Incidence exhibited dual seasonal peaks linked to atmospheric pressure, sunshine duration, and humidity; (2) Host-to-person transmission (β p') was most sensitive to climatic conditions, peaking at 1013 hPa and declining sharply above 75% humidity, while susceptible person-to-infected person (β) and environment-to-person (β w) transmission were primarily modulated by humidity and wind speed; (3) The GAM validation confirmed robust performance for transmission coefficients (p < 0.001). Predictions for 2019-2021 highlighted persistent seasonal bimodality, reinforcing the model's utility for outbreak forecasting. Meteorological factors drive HEV transmission through distinct pathways, with host-to-person interactions being particularly climate-sensitive. While the GAM provided valuable insights, future research incorporating behavioral and land-use factors, as well as causal inference models, will be critical for improving the understanding and predictive accuracy of HEV transmission dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Strong and effective leadership is essential for the success of public health systems. It serves as the driving force that inspires, guides, and empowers individuals to improve the health of their communities and strengthen their organizations. Leadership is not merely supplementary but a core element in tackling the increasingly complex challenges facing public health today. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in our systems for emergency preparedness and response, highlighting just how critical capable leadership is within governmental public health. These challenges are magnified by persistent workforce issues, including knowledge gaps, limited development opportunities, and concerns around long-term sustainability. Further complicating the landscape are rising levels of political polarization and incidents of harassment directed at public health professionals. In response to these pressures and a growing wave of workforce attrition, there is now a heightened national focus on developing the next generation of public health leaders. This development must be intentional and structured, relying on well-designed, competency-based approaches rather than informal or inconsistent methods. Public health leaders must be equipped with the skills to navigate the evolving demands of modern health systems. In 2022, the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) convened an expert panel to develop a national leadership training agenda tailored to the governmental public health workforce. The panel consisted of 15 academic and practice leaders in the United States. Between 2022 and 2024, the panel met regularly to define the essential attributes of public health leadership and determine effective strategies for cultivating them through education and capacity-building efforts. The result of this collaborative effort is the ASPPH Public Health Leadership Competency Mapping and Training Agenda: a foundational framework designed to strengthen capabilities across current and future governmental public health professionals. This article presents that framework, marking an important step toward building a more resilient, competent, and adaptive public health workforce.",

    "abstract": "Otologic adverse events (AEs) have been occasionally reported as sequalae of COVID-19 vaccination, although their incidence in comparison with that of preexisting vaccines with high uptake remains unclear. This study compared the rates of new-onset otologic AEs among matched adults receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccination versus influenza vaccination. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records (EHR) data from Stanford Health Care to identify adults aged 50-89 years with no history of otologic disorders prior to first Pfizer/Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-January 2022) or any pre-pandemic influenza vaccine (January 2016-December 2019). Patients were categorized by vaccination into FluVax or COVIDVax cohorts. A 90-day history pre-vaccination (baseline period) and ≥6 months follow-up post-vaccination were required. Event rates of new-onset hearing loss (HL), sudden HL, tinnitus, vertigo/dizziness, aural fullness, and otalgia in the 6 months post-vaccination were compared between groups after high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) matching. A sensitivity analysis was conducted among patients with no COVID-19 infection at any time. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression for the hdPS matched cohorts. After hdPS matching, 20,325 patients were included into the FluVax and COVIDVax cohorts, respectively (mean age: 65.5 and 65.2 years; 53.1 and 53.8% females). The rates of otologic AEs in the 6 months post-vaccination were similarly low for the FluVax and COVIDVax cohorts: 1.16% vs. 1.16% for any HL, 0.01% vs. 0.02% for sudden HL, 0.41% vs. 0.47% for tinnitus, 1.96% vs. 1.59% for vertigo, 0.27% vs. 0.25% for otalgia, and 0.09% vs. 0.2% for aural fullness. COVIDVax patients had lower odds of vertigo [OR 95% CI: 0.81 (0.70, 0.94)] and higher odds of aural fullness [2.16 (1.25-3.72)] than the FluVax patients (both p < 0.05). The results of the sensitivity analysis limited to patients with no COVID-19 infection at any time (N = 17,530 each cohort) were consistent with the primary results, but aural fullness was the only AE with statistically higher risk in the COVIDVax vs. FluVax cohort [OR (95% CI): 1.90 (1.09-3.31); p = 0.021]. New-onset otologic AEs were rare among a large cohort of hdPS-matched patients who received mRNA COVID-19 or pre-pandemic flu vaccination at a single institution. Although aural fullness was statistically more common in the COVIDVax vs. FluVax cohort, regardless of COVID-19 infection status, it remained extremely rare (<0.22%) in any cohort. These results indicate a similar otologic safety profile of the two vaccines, although future research is recommended in larger EHR databases to corroborate the findings.",

    "title": "Comparative evaluation of GeneXpert and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: a retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "Background. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted vulnerabilities in healthcare systems and has brought the world to a standstill single-handedly. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical for understanding epidemiology, contact tracing, case management and controlling the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Real-time reverse transcription PCR test, the gold standard test, involves fairly complex steps and takes nearly 24-48 h to generate the results. GeneXpert is a rapid nucleic-acid-detection-based test approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research, which can shorten the turnaround time significantly. Aim. The study aimed to compare the performance of GeneXpert against the gold standard real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods. This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care centre from 25 March 2020 to 8 December 2020. The nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs that were sent to the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory for testing of SARS-CoV-2 by GeneXpert [cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT)] were included for the study. A total of 270 samples (220 samples positive and 50 samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by GeneXpert) were simultaneously tested for real-time reverse transcription PCR. Real-time reverse transcription PCR was considered as gold standard test (reference) for calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the GeneXpert (CBNAAT) test. Results. Out of the total samples tested (n=270) for SARS-CoV-2, 220 were positive, and 50 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by GeneXpert. Among 220 GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, 118 (53.64%) were also positive by real-time reverse transcription PCR, while 102 (46.36%) showed negative results by real-time reverse transcription PCR. However, 50 GeneXpert negative samples showed 100% agreement with real-time reverse transcription PCR, i.e. they were also negative by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The GeneXpert sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 were seen to be 100% (95% CI: 96.92-100%) and 32.89% (95% CI: 25.50-40.97%), respectively, as compared to the gold standard real-time reverse transcription PCR test. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of GeneXpert for COVID-19 were found to be 53.64% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion. This study highlights that the GeneXpert test is highly sensitive and found to be useful in emergency and challenging situations for rapidly ruling out negative cases. However, due to its relatively low specificity, positive results should be confirmed with real-time reverse transcription PCR. Therefore, it can serve as a valuable tool for patients requiring urgent care by facilitating early diagnosis and management of COVID-19, ultimately contributing to preventing morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenems are vital antibiotics used to treat severe infections, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Understanding their utilization, reimbursement, and pricing trends is critical to inform healthcare policies and ensure sustainable access. This study aimed to analyze longitudinal trends in carbapenem use, market dynamics, and economic impact within Medicaid from 1991 to 2023. A retrospective, longitudinal analysis was conducted using publicly available Medicaid State Drug Utilization data. Four carbapenems; imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem were examined. Data on prescriptions, reimbursements, and proxy pricing were extracted, aggregated, and analyzed. Trends and market shares were evaluated annually, with statistical analyses and visualizations performed using Excel and Power BI. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify shifts in the direction of these trends, providing insights into significant changes over time. Carbapenem utilization and reimbursement exhibited significant growth, particularly between 2015 and 2020, driven by increased reliance on these agents for severe infections. Imipenem/cilastatin prescriptions peaked in 2005 at 22,883 prescriptions, with an Annual Percent Change (APC) of 12.28% (95% CI: 11.33 to 14.03%, p < 0.001). Reimbursements for imipenem/cilastatin reached $7.6 million in the same year. Following 2005, a sharp decline in prescriptions occurred, with an APC of -30.36% (95% CI: -33.96% to -25.44%, p < 0.001), and reimbursements dropped to $839,581 by 2023. Meropenem prescriptions exhibited steady growth, peaking at 53,355 in 2016, with an Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) of 17.29% (95% CI: 13.97 to 29.71%, p < 0.001). Reimbursements for meropenem reached $10.9 million in 2016 before stabilizing at $7.2 million in 2023. Ertapenem, introduced in 2002, demonstrated the most substantial growth, peaking in 2021 with 116,988 prescriptions and $30.7 million in reimbursements. Its APC between 2002 and 2015 was 19.05% (95% CI: 13.56 to 109.30%, p = 0.023). Doripenem prescriptions peaked at 2,954 in 2011 but declined sharply at an APC of -39.24% (95% CI: -52.08% to -35.15%, p < 0.001), with reimbursements dropping to negligible levels by 2017. Declines in carbapenem prescriptions and reimbursements after 2021 reflect antimicrobial stewardship efforts and shifts toward targeted therapies. This study underscores dynamic shifts in carbapenem utilization, highlighting the impact of clinical practices, stewardship initiatives, and policy changes on prescribing trends. Continuous monitoring of antibiotic use is essential to balance effective infection management with the containment of antimicrobial resistance and healthcare costs. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of stewardship programs and the introduction of novel therapeutic options on carbapenem utilization.",

    "title": "An In Silico Investigation of Brazilian Green Propolis Extracts as Potential Treatment for COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "The absence of a specific antiviral treatment for the highly virulent and lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remains a significant challenge. The potential of natural agents with immune-promotion capabilities, including apitherapy products, is being investigated as a potential therapeutic modality. Propolis is characterized by a high concentration of bioactive compounds, which exhibit significant antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. This study investigated the potential of ethanolic extracts of Brazilian green propolis for COVID-19 treatment. Propolis extracts were obtained at room (EEPV-F) and under 70 °C-heat (EEPV-Q) temperatures, and the extraction yields were 36.74% and 53.54%, respectively. Total flavonoid contents (10.6 ± 0.9 and 6.6 ± 0.2 mg QE g-1), total phenolic compounds (44 ± 2 and 66 ± 3 mg GAE g-1), and antioxidant capacity by DPPH (IC50 values of 18.0 ± 0.3 and 16.6 ± 0.5 μg mL-1) and ABTS (IC50 values of 16.6 ± 0.02 and 15.3 ± 0.2 μg mL-1) assays were determined. The extracts were not cytotoxic to RAW 264.7 macrophages and exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity, particularly EEPV-Q. All EEPV-Q concentrations significantly reduced nitric oxide production and demonstrated suitability for further investigation. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the compound guibourtinidol-(4alpha→8)-epiafzelechin exhibited stronger binding affinity for PLpro, RdRp, and Spike-analyzed enzymes. Both EEPV-F and EEPV-Q presented hemolytic activity below 5% across all tested concentrations. Given the limited therapeutic options available for COVID-19, the utilization of green propolis as a therapeutic agent has emerged as a promising and relevant approach. This natural product possesses several advantages, including its safety, ease of oral administration, and its availability as both a natural supplement and a functional food.",

    "abstract": "Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147), a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been identified as a potential auxiliary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP), contributing to COVID-19 infection. However, the detailed binding characteristics of this interaction remain unclear. Here, we characterized SP-CD147 binding using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) under varying contact times and temperatures. While SP binds CD147 with lower force than angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at normal body temperatures, its binding strength to CD147 significantly increases under fever-like conditions, contrasting with SP-ACE2 interactions, which weaken at elevated temperatures. We further investigated the role of heparin in modulating this interaction and found that heparin independently binds both CD147 and SP, enhancing the interaction force between CD147 and SP, as confirmed by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and SMFS. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations provided atomic-level insights into the stabilizing role of heparin within the SP/CD147 complex. These findings offer a comprehensive characterization of the CD147-SP interaction, revealing potential therapeutic avenues for COVID-19 intervention.",

Using continuous cross-sectional data from 99,973 U.S. adults who visited the Project Implicit Health website between 2011-2022, we compared trends in anxiety outcomes between emerging adults (age 18-25) and adults age 26+, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to hypotheses, average anxiety severity and strength of implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations did not spike at the start of the pandemic, and rates of change did not significantly differ by age from 2011-2020, except for explicit, non-relative self-as-anxious ratings. Instead, anxiety mostly remained stable, with emerging adults exhibiting consistently higher anxiety symptom severity and stronger implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations than adults age 26+.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions have changed the lives of people around the world. Compliance with the recommendations issued by the WHO and the ministries of health of individual countries was important in order to limit the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus. Over time, public vaccinations against COVID-19 appeared, which gave rise to a wave of anti-vaccine demonstrations. Bearing in mind the hypothesis about the relationship between the characteristics of the Dark Triad and pro-health behaviors, The aim of the study was to analyze the possible correlations between Dark Triad personality traits, the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and vaccination behavior. 419 people participated in the study, including 317 people aged 35.87 ± 13.65 SD years who received the Covid-19 vaccination and 102 people aged 38.18 ± 12.13 SD years who decided not to receive the vaccine. The Dirty Dozen Scale (DDS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) were used in the study. On the Dirty Dozen Scale, the vaccinated group had an average score of 23.29 ± 10.10 SD and the unvaccinated group had an average score of 20.81 ± 8.84 SD. Comparative analysis of the study groups showed statistically significant differences both in the overall DDS score and in its subscales - machiavellianism and narcissism. There were no differences in the psychopathy subscale. When analyzing the relationship between anxiety as a trait and stress assessed with the PSS-10 scale, no statistically significant correlations were found in the overall score on the DDS scale, as well as in the subscales of machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism. In the study, people with features of machiavellianism and narcissism more often decided to vaccinate against COVID-19, such a relationship could not be established for people with features of psychopathy. Aversive personality traits that are part of the Dark Triad (DD) are associated with non-compliance with the imposed norms or sanitary regime related to the pandemic, but they do not exclude concern for the health of the individual. Further research is needed on the Dark Triad in the context of social and cultural differences and in the field of undertaking pro-health behaviors.",

    "title": "Pathological and non-pathological hikikomori: social media use, digital engagement, and therapeutic implications.",
    "abstract": "Hikikomori is traditionally defined as a form of pathological social withdrawal marked by extreme social isolation in one's home, leading to significant functional impairment or distress. However, shifts in working and study habits since COVID-19 have introduced the concept of 'non-pathological hikikomori' to describe individuals who are isolated in their homes but do not experience functional impairment or distress. Hikikomori are frequent users of the internet and social media, which raises interesting questions regarding the relationship between social withdrawal and physical withdrawal. This study examined whether social media use differs by hikikomori status (pathological vs. non-pathological) and phase (early [<3 months], pre- [3-6 months], full [6+ months]). A cross-sectional study recruited 1,420 self-identified frequent internet users (aged 18-25) via Prolific, who completed a questionnaire on their social media activity (time spent; type of communication), hikikomori status (pathological/non-pathological), and phase (early/pre/full). Of these, 1,235 identified as hikikomori (Mage = 21.5, SD = 2.2; females = 661, males = 572, undisclosed = 2). Within this group, 455 were classified as pathological hikikomori (early = 113, pre = 151, full = 191), while 780 were non-pathological (early = 179, pre = 201, full = 400). Pathological hikikomori used significantly more social media platforms than non-pathological hikikomori (4.16 vs 3.84: F(1,1224)=20.05, p<.001, ηp²=.016). In terms of phase, full hikikomori (3.82) used fewer social media platforms than early (4.01) and pre (4.13) hikikomori, (F(2,1224)=7.19, p<.001, ηp²=.012: early and pre hikikomori did not differ from each other). The interaction between pathological status and phase was not significant [F(2,1224)=1.28, p=.278, ηp²=.002]. Social media platforms were not used for more time by pathological compared to non-pathological hikikomori, but there were differences in how the social media platforms were used. Regarding communication style, across all phases, pathological hikikomori consistently engaged with others via TikTok and YouTube significantly more than non-pathological hikikomori. Using TikTok and YouTube, Pathological hikikomori sent more messages [F(1,958)=8.77, p=.003, ηp²=.009; F(1,1161)=21.50, p<.001, ηp²=.018; respectively] and received more messages [F(1,958)=13.15, p<.001, ηp²=.014; F(1,1161)=21.37, p<.001, ηp²=.018; respectively], had more targeted messages [F(1,958)=8.49, p=.004, ηp²=.009; F(1,1161)=20.77, p<.001, ηp²=.018; respectively], had more stylised messages [F(1,958)=13.60, p<.001, ηp²=.014; F(1,1161)=24.13, p<.001, ηp²=.020; respectively] and had more broadcast messages [F(1,958)=7.58, p=.006, ηp²=.008; F(1,1161)=13.22, p<.001, ηp²=.011; respectively] than non-pathological hikikomori. These findings suggest a complex relationship between social media use and social withdrawal. Future research should explore whether communication through YouTube and TikTok is linked to social isolation and whether these platforms could serve as intervention tools to support pathological hikikomori. Importantly, as the sample consisted of self-identified frequent internet users, generalizability to the broader population of hikikomori should be treated with caution.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several studies have investigated the incidence of chronic diseases among Adventists, but less is known about the association between the prevalence of infectious diseases and the Adventist lifestyle. Methods: This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and has been registered on PROSPERO under CRD42024502363. Relevant studies were searched in databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Observational studies reporting on the prevalence or occurrence of infectious diseases within the Adventist community were included if they were published in English language. The included studies were synthesised in the form of a narrative synthesis. Results: The outcomes related to infectious conditions identified were Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, antibodies to Vibrio species and Norwalk virus, upper respiratory infections (URIs), COVID-19 disease, H1N1 influenza, and infectious disease-related mortality. A lower prevalence of some infectious diseases was shown among Adventists. A study noted lower Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in Adventists, and another associated high fruit, vegetable, and water intake with fewer respiratory infections. Conclusions: The Adventist lifestyle may be associated with a lower prevalence of infectious diseases, likely due in part to the Adventist diet. However, further research is needed to clarify the relative contributions of individual lifestyle factors to these protective effects.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the global population, with 1.5 million Americans diagnosed annually. Despite higher mortality rates in this group, trends by year, gender, and region remain insufficiently explored. This study evaluated global trends in schizophrenia (F20) mortality from 1999 to 2020, analyzing variations by year, gender, and region. Additionally, we examined age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) by place of death and year to provide a comprehensive understanding of these trends. The CDC WONDER database was used to analyze schizophrenia-related mortality from 1999 to 2020, calculating mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess national trends. Throughout the study, males had higher AAMRs for schizophrenia (1.3%, 95% CI: 1.3-1.3) than females (0.9%, 95% Cl: 0.9-1.4). In metropolitan areas, the AAMR was 96.6, declining from 1999 to 2015 (APC: -1.07%) before rising (APC: 6.41%). Non-metropolitan areas had an AAMR of 58.9, decreasing from 1999 to 2017 (APC: -0.86%) before increasing by 2020 (APC: 8.95%). Overall, schizophrenia-related AAMRs rose from 1.2 in 1999 to 1.4 in 2020, with fluctuations. Schizophrenia-related mortality declined from 1999 to 2015 but rose afterward. Males consistently had higher AAMRs, while urban areas showed greater mortality, reflecting social and environmental risks. Early declines may be linked to improved psychiatric care, whereas the recent rise correlates with the opioid epidemic and COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for better investment in mental health care, early intervention, access in underserved areas, and better management of comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic could have caused both monetary and non-monetary distributional changes, existing studies have only investigated its immediate monetary impacts. This study examines the pandemic's medium-term impacts on income and well-being inequality using individual longitudinal data from the Japan Household Panel Survey. Gini coefficients and income mobility before and after the pandemic are calculated to analyze income inequality. Various well-being measures such as mental health and life satisfaction are used to analyze well-being inequality. The findings reveal no increase in income inequality. Progressive income growth ensured stable inequality throughout the pandemic. Conversely, on average, well-being worsened, and well-being inequality increased. Furthermore, we find an association between income and well-being inequality. The random-effects and fixed-effects models indicate that the well-being of the high-income group tended to improve, whereas that of the low-income group tended to deteriorate after the outbreak of the pandemic. Additionally, the causal mediation analysis shows that the adoption of remote work served as a factor for the increase in the well-being of people in the high-income group. Remote work became disproportionately prevalent during the pandemic, especially among people in the higher income group. This group experienced various benefits of remote work, which contributed to an improvement in their well-being and an increase in well-being inequality.",

ISBAR strengthens communication skills in clinical teams, increases self-confidence and efficacy among healthcare practitioners, improves interprofessional communication, reduces medical errors, and enhances patient safety. Our systematic review confirms that ISBAR handover improved the quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic and non-COVID clinical practice. The limitation of this study is related to the lack of randomized controlled trials and blinding.

Previously, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody, Nanosota-3A, that neutralizes the infection of live Omicron BA.1 with picomolar potency, is identified. Herein, Nanosota-3A is fused with the crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain of human IgG1 that contains M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) substitutions, named Nanosota-3A-Fc-YTE. Compared to Nanosota-3A-Fc, Nanosota-3A-Fc-YTE exhibits identical binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein yet displays eightfold higher binding affinity for human neonatal Fc receptor (hFcRn) at pH 6.0. In hFcRn transgenic mice, the half-life of Nanosota-3A-Fc and Nanosota-3A-Fc-YTE is 5.1 days and 24.8 days, respectively. The mice are challenged with intranasal exposure of Omicron B.1.1.529 virus 55 days after a single dose of Nanosota-3A fusions (20 mg kg-1) is administered. Compared to the untreated controls, the lung viral titers in mice receiving Nanosota-3A-Fc-YTE are reduced by 104.7-fold (p = 0.007) with 50% of the mice free of detectable virus. By contrast, Nanosota-3A-Fc-treated mice show only 3.5-fold reduction in the viral titers (p = 0.41). The durable protection conferred by a single dose of Nanosota-3A-Fc-YTE administered nearly 2 months prior to the virus exposure demonstrates the promise of long-circulating nanobodies as powerful prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2.",

Informed by Conservation of Resources Theory, the current study assessed the impact of stress-related risk factors, including trauma and COVID-19-related stress, on ABE students' (N = 227) vocational confidence. Understanding these factors can inform ABE program development and retention efforts. Survey methods with convenience sampling were used for data collection. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between trauma exposure and COVID-19-related stress on the outcomes of alcohol use, as a stress response, as well as vocational confidence. On average, past traumatic experiences were more common among ABE students who reported greater social or economic marginalization, especially those identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual or with a history of being unhoused. More past traumatic experiences predicted higher COVID-19-related stress and alcohol use. Higher COVID-19-related stress, in turn, predicted lower vocational confidence. ABE students experiencing marginalization face compounded barriers to achieving their educational and vocational goals when they experience trauma exposure and subsequent stressors. Based on findings, we make practice recommendations for ABE centers, including targeted psychoeducational resources to offset social and systemic stressors that may bolster the vocational confidence of enrolled students.",

To address this, this study employed the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Computing Platform (TCMICS) to collect clinical prescriptions for IBV treatment, based on which two optimized versions of the traditional Chinese medicine Maxing Shigan Decoction (MXSG), namely MXSG-mix1 and MXSG-mix2, were designed. In vitro cell culture and in vivo chicken model experiments were then carried out, including egg testing, clinical symptom observation, immune function analysis, and viral load quantification, to assess the antiviral activity of the optimized formulations. To explore the underlying mechanisms, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was combined with network pharmacology to identify 28 active compounds in MXSG-mix and 47 key genes involved in viral replication, inflammation, and apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking and RT-qPCR were performed, which confirmed that MXSG-mix downregulated BCL2 expression and interacted with AKT1 and CASP3, thus inhibiting IBV-induced cell apoptosis. The results showed that both MXSG-mix1 and MXSG-mix2 exhibited superior anti-IBV activity compared to traditional MXSG, effectively reducing viral load and improving immune responses in vivo. In conclusion, integrating TCMICS, LC-MS, and network pharmacology offers a novel paradigm for developing veterinary TCM formulations. The optimized MXSG-mix shows potential as an effective, multi-target therapeutic against IBV, providing valuable insights for future anti-viral drug development in poultry medicine.",

The use of the Target Trial framework, along with developments in statistical methodology such as doubly robust and G-estimation methods, has improved the ability to draw reliable causal inferences about drug and vaccine safety from observational data. However, such models rarely relate drug safety outcomes to other domains such as economic impacts. As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, this is a significant limitation with potentially serious and long-term consequences. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the availability of simulation tools would enable policy-makers to assess drug safety and effectiveness outcomes associated with alternative policies, as well as examine these effects in the context of other domains, such as economic outcomes. We develop an agent-based simulation model (ABM) of a peer navigator program to support engagement in HIV therapy in Tanzania. Results from the ABM are weighted to reflect the Tanzanian population and fed into the SPECTRUM model. This generates detailed demographic forecasts that are translated into macroeconomic impacts using labor force participation rates from the International Labor Organization, along with an econometric model of gross domestic product. The ABM simulation estimated that the peer navigation program increased ART participation for men and women by about 12%-15% with no strong trend over time. The impact on VLS, however, was cumulative and significant for both men and women. By year 3, VLS was improved by 33.9 percentage points for women and 32.6 percentage points for men. However, the overall impact of these estimates on mortality was modest-ranging from less than 500 lives per year at the start of the forecast period to about 2500 lives per year in 2030. Consequently, the associated macroeconomic impacts were also small. The relatively modest impacts were due to the limited opportunity for HIV control in Tanzania, which had already met its 95/95/95 goals. Although the simulated macroeconomic effects of the peer navigator program in Tanzania were modest, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of linking behavioral ABM simulations of program impacts to subsequent demographic effects and, finally, macroeconomic performance. Moreover, given the clinical response in ART and VLS in the exposed population in Tanzania, it is likely that the same peer navigator intervention conducted in another country with a larger at-risk HIV population would be much larger. Simulating the effects of a peer navigation program on antiretroviral treatment and outcomes in Tanzania Pharmacoepidemiology and drug utilization studies using data from medical claims or electronic medical records are important tools for understanding the performance of drugs and other interventions in real world practice. Typically, however, such studies focus on treated patients and do not address the behavioral aspects of how patients decide upon treatment in the first place. We use an agent-based simulation model to estimate the impact of a peer navigation program in Tanzania on antiretroviral therapy (ART) participation and adherence, as well as viral load suppression (VLS) for HIV patients. We then estimate the impacts of the program on Tanzanian mortality rates by weighting the patient level estimates to reflect population estimates. Finally, we evaluate the impacts of estimated mortality changes on the productive capacity of the labor force and economic growth. The agent-based simulation finds that the peer navigation program had substantial positive impacts on ART participation for men and women, as well as VLS. However, the ultimate impacts of these effects on mortality and associated economic outcomes were relatively small. This appeared to be due to the relatively small size of the at-risk population who could potentially benefit from the intervention. To our knowledge, the current study represents the first successful linkage of a behavioral agent-based simulation model of a behavioral health policy intervention with its demographic implications and subsequent macroeconomic ramifications. Although the simulated effects of our study focused on a peer navigator program, rather than a drug per se, the outcomes measured utilization of ART and VLS. The ability to incorporate behavioral aspects of drug treatment patterns through agent-based simulation offers the potential to better understand drug treatment safety and effectiveness, as well as how such outcomes might be improved with augmentative approaches such as peer navigation programs.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdowns significantly disrupted healthcare systems, including access to pharmacological treatments such as sleep medication. This study investigated the number of first-time dispensed hypnotic drugs during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands, using data from the Dutch Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics (SFK), which covers approximately 96% of all pharmacy dispensations (5.46 million patients). First-time dispensing was defined as no use of hypnotics in the previous year and included benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-related drugs, and melatonin receptor agonists. Data from 2020 were analysed across three periods: pre-lockdown (Weeks 1-11), lockdown (Weeks 12-19) and post-lockdown (Weeks 20-26), and were compared to the same periods in 2019. Analyses were stratified by age group (children: 0-9, adolescents: 10-19, adults: 20-64, elderly: 65+) and sex. The data revealed a significant reduction in first-time hypnotic dispensations in 2020 (155,961) compared to 2019 (168,814, p < 0.001), with declines across all three time periods (p < 0.001). During the lockdown, significant reductions were found among children, adolescents, and adults (p < 0.001), but not among the elderly. Female adults and the elderly received significantly more hypnotics than their male counterparts (p < 0.001), consistent with higher reported rates of sleep disturbances. In conclusion, the overall number of first-time dispensed hypnotics was significantly lower during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands, except among the elderly. It remains unclear to what extent individuals self-medicated with over-the-counter sleep medication, or experienced untreated sleep complaints during the first lockdown in the Netherlands.",

    "title": "Deep Phenotyping at Scale: Study Protocol for the Korean Mood Disorder Genetic Study-Depression (KOMOGEN-D).",
    "abstract": "A core challenge in the genetic analysis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is how to recruit large numbers of stringently diagnosed cases with sufficient information to explore the interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors and evaluate genetic influences on putative MD subtypes and key clinical features. Currently, most genome-wide association studies of MDD rely on self-administered questionnaires or electronic health records, both of which are limited in diagnostic accuracy and introduce systematic, heritable biases that confound the interpretation of genetic analyses. Here, we describe how to address this problem through a combination of targeted ascertainment and in-depth phenotyping by clinical interview. We increase the homogeneity of the sample, reducing the number of cases needed to detect genetic signals, by recruiting only women with recurrent depressive episodes, ascertained through hospitals. Structured interviews capture detailed information on the known and putative risk factors for the disorder. We trained 347 interviewers working at 47 participating hospitals across South Korea and recruited 5704 cases and 4995 screened controls over 4 years toward a total target sample of 10,000 cases and 10,000 controls. We met and overcame a series of logistic challenges, including restrictions due to COVID-19 and an ongoing medical crisis. We confirmed that our cases have recurrent, severe MDD and are suitable to explore the causes of recurrent episodes of disturbances of sleep and appetite, suicidality, guilty ruminations, anhedonia, and low mood. Our study design provides deeply phenotyped cases and screened controls at scale and can be adapted for deployment in other countries to yield cohorts for the genetic analysis of MDD.",

    "abstract": "Many SARS-CoV-2 patients experience chronic pulmonary symptoms and long-term inflammation despite viral clearance. While these clinical manifestations have been linked to the dysregulation of the adaptive immune response, the underlying immunopathology remains poorly understood due to a lack of suitable animal models. To investigate long-term pulmonary consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used a genetic cross of 129 mice and C57BL/6 (B6)-K18-hACE2 transgene mice, a model previously shown to survive infection. 129xB6-K18-hACE2 mice or littermate controls were infected with a low dose (5 × 102 PFU) of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Complete viral clearance and full recovery from weight loss occurred by day 8 post-infection. However, prolonged inflammation in the lung and airways persisted up to day 28 post-infection and was associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly CD8+ effector T cells. This model may therefore prove valuable for further understanding of drivers of long-term lung inflammation and for testing therapeutic strategies and clinically relevant interventions that can target long-term pulmonary inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "While mental health trends among Chinese adolescents have been widely studied, the rural population remains understudied despite its distinctive socioeconomic context, especially regarding long-term trends before, during, and after COVID-19. This study investigates decade-long (2012-2022) depression trends among Chinese rural adolescents, focusing on pandemic-related changes and variations by gender and age. Data for this analysis were drawn from the longitudinal surveys of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) (N = 9,695; age 10-15). Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to determine change patterns in rural adolescents' depression over time. Multiple regression models were computed to assess gender and age differences in pre-pandemic and pandemic-era depression changes. The findings reveal that (a) No statistically significant changes in depression were observed before the COVID-19 pandemic from 2012 to 2018; (b) a statistically significant increase in depression occurred from 2018 to 2020; (c) subsequently, a significant decline was noted from 2020 to 2022; and (d) no statistically significant differences were found between two gender and different age groups regarding their change in depression before and during the COVID-19. The study reveals pandemic-specific fluctuations in rural adolescent depression that affected all subgroups uniformly, highlighting the universal impact of COVID-19 disruptions in rural contexts.",

Preventative behavior such as wearing masks and hand hygiene are required to stop transmission, but there is concern that the perceived efficacy of vaccines could elicit risk compensation, leading to a decrease in preventative behavior. A convenience sample of 315 vaccinated Indonesian adults (mean age 36.2 years, 61% female) participated in this cross-sectional online study, completing measures of risk perception, social norm, perceived vaccine efficacy, pandemic fatigue, demographic characteristics, and preventative behavior between March and May 2022. Hierarchical regression of preventative behavior showed that perceived vaccine efficacy was a significant positive instead of negative predictor, thus providing no evidence for risk compensation (β = .154, P = .002).

    "title": "Design of Pore-Space-Partitioned Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Spiro Ligand Chemistry.",
    "abstract": "An emerging direction in the design of crystalline porous materials is the application of bioisosteric replacement strategy that replaces benzene ring with an aliphatic core; however, maintaining isoreticular chemistry upon such replacement is elusive. While bicyclic cores have been employed for this purpose, few studies are known that use spiro ligands for designing metal-organic frameworks for gas separation applications. As a benzene bioisostere, spiro ligands are more challenging than other bioisosteres because they are more flexible and deviate significantly from that of para-benzene-based ligands. In this work, we show that the use of a pore-space-partition strategy generates a multimodule system in which it is possible to exert a high level of control over the positioning, orientation, and alignment of carboxylate groups in a spiro ligand. Here, we report a family of isoreticular MOFs on a partitioned acs (pacs) structure with spiro[3.3]heptane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid as the framework-forming module, together with three different pore-partition modules based on tripyridyl ligands. The isoreticular chemistry can be extended to both homometallic (Fe) and heterometallic (CoV and CoFe) compositions. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO2 (61.9 cm3/g) and small hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 116.3 cm3/g for C2H2 and 101.4 cm3/g for C2H4), inverse C2H6/C2H4 selectivity, and promising separation performance for C2H2/CO2 (selectivity up to 5.5), C3H8/CH4 (selectivity up to 279), and C2H6/CH4 (selectivity up to 22.7) gas mixtures.",

    "title": "Acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 - histological and immunohistochemical study.",
    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).",

While studies have examined risk perception as a dual process, its application to real-world risk situations is unexplored. This study investigated the relationships between risk perception, social contact changes, and social isolation during COVID-19. A nationwide cross-sectional sample of 804 adults completed computer-assisted telephone interviews. The main variables were social isolation (face-to-face and non-face-to-face) and risk perception (affective and cognitive). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, logistic regression models, and multinomial logistic regression models. Affective and cognitive risk perceptions were associated with changes in face-to-face and non-face-to-face social contact. Only affective risk perception was associated with social isolation. Thus, social isolation is a health-related concept, higher levels are associated with poorer mental and physical health. In addition, the isolation-reduction recommendations put forth have important well-being-improvement implications.",

Among these, digital media campaigns, community outreach programmes and promotional efforts have been widely used. However, there remains limited understanding of their relative effectiveness in influencing vaccine acceptance, particularly within the Nigerian context. This study aimed to assess the relationship between digital media campaigns, community outreach programmes and promotional efforts and their influence on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Plateau State, Nigeria, while identifying which strategy had the most significant impact. A cross-sectional mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 300 adult respondents using a structured questionnaire, while qualitative data were obtained through key informant interviews. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation and regression analyses were used to analyse the quantitative data, and thematic analysis was applied to qualitative responses. Promotion efforts exhibited the strongest positive correlation with vaccine acceptance (Spearman's rho=0.490, p<0.01), followed by community outreach programmes (rho=0.414, p<0.01) and digital media campaigns (rho=0.239, p<0.01). Regression analysis showed that promotional efforts accounted for 24.0% of the variance in vaccine acceptance (R2=0.240), while community outreach and digital campaigns accounted for 17.1% and 5.7%, respectively. The sample was predominantly educated and older, which may have influenced receptiveness to certain communication strategies. All three strategies were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, with promotional efforts being the most impactful. These findings highlight the importance of prioritising community-based promotional campaigns, supported by outreach programmes and digital media, particularly in settings with varying access and trust in health systems.",

Retrospective analysis of patient complaints (22 March 2022-28 June 2024). A newly established general hospital with approximately 700 beds in the metropolitan area of Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, which was established during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1113 patient complaints comprising 1952 discrete complaint issues were collected, with submissions originating from patients themselves (64%), family members or friends (21%) and individuals with unclear relationships to patients (15%). Primary outcome measures comprised occurrence and severity of patient harm. Secondary outcome measures included distribution of complaints across clinical, management and relationship domains, and identification of healthcare stages with concentrated harm using hotspot analysis and logistic regression. Of the complaints, 78% did not result in harm. Among those that did, 52%, 40% and 7% were of low, moderate and high severity, respectively. Hotspot analysis indicated that harm was concentrated during diagnosis (stage 2), ward care (stage 3) and operation/procedure (stage 4) stages, with stage 4 exhibiting the highest Pearson residual value of 9.56. Logistic regression indicated that clinical domain complaints had the strongest association with patient harm (OR=32.25, 95% CI=20.88 to 51.01, p<0.001), while the operation/procedure stage exhibited the highest stage-specific risk (OR=30.62, 95% CI=9.80 to 93.93, p<0.001). This study highlighted the critical care stages in which harm was concentrated, emphasising the need for proactive risk management particularly during operations and procedures. The findings provide valuable insights into resource allocation and underscore the importance of patient complaints in improving healthcare quality and safety across healthcare institutions.",

This is the first large-scale, comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing major IC/IS categories to assess the risks of severe outcomes from COVID-19 in people with IC/IS conditions during the Omicron era-the period dominated by the most recent major COVID-19 variant. A systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Europe PMC, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and WHO COVID-19 database was performed to identify studies published between January 1, 2022, and March 13, 2024. Studies included people (all ages) with at least one of the following conditions: unspecified IC/IS, transplant, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, liver diseases, chronic or end-stage kidney disease, and advanced/untreated HIV. Studies were synthesized quantitatively using random-effects models. Evaluated outcomes were risks of death, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and any combination of these outcomes. Seventy-two studies were included, of which 66 were included in the meta-analysis. Minimum numbers of participants per IC/IS condition ranged from 12,634 to 3,287,816. Of all meta-analyzed IC/IS conditions, transplant recipients had the highest risk of death (pooled relative risk [RR], 6.78; 95% CI: 4.41-10.43; P < 0.001), hospitalization (RR, 6.75; 95% CI 3.41-13.37; P < 0.001), and combined outcomes (RR, 8.65; 95% CI 4.01-18.65; P < 0.001), while participants in the unspecified IC/IS group had the highest risk of ICU admission (RR, 3.38; 95% CI 2.37-4.83; P < 0.001) compared with participants without the respective IC/IS conditions or general population. In the Omicron era, people with IC/IS conditions have a substantially higher risk of death and hospitalization from COVID-19.",

The WHO reported that COVID-19 still poses a threat to humanity, and especially in some areas with large numbers of infected people. For some high-risk COVID-19 patients, such as those with underlying conditions, elderly patients, patients who need long-term immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplantation, patients with immunosuppressive diseases, patients who tend not to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 despite standard antiviral therapy, and cancer patients, special attention is still required after infection with SARS-CoV-2. How to clear SARS-CoV-2 in a timely manner is the key to treating such patients. Based on the demands of clinical practice and medical evidence, the National Center for Infectious Diseases of China assembled experts from relevant disciplines to reach the Chinese expert consensus on the combined use of antivirals to treat COVID-19, providing timely suggestions to resolve the medication issues that have been plaguing clinical practice. The consensus suggests that for special patients, combined medication can promptly eliminate the virus without increasing the risk to patient safety.",

We conducted this cross-sectional study (n=1689) using a self-administered online questionnaire featuring anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional habits, dietary supplement usage, and three scales. We applied the Beck Depression Inventory, Short-Form 12-item Questionnaire, and MedDiet Adherence Screener to evaluate participants' mental health, HRQoL, and diet quality, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adherence to the MedDiet increased significantly (6.1±2.2 vs. 6.3±2.4; p<0.001). However, mental health scores declined significantly (46.1±7.3 vs. 40.6±6.8; p<0.001). Females (p=0.020), those with high education levels (p<0.05), and those with chronic diseases (p=0.022) had a lower risk of poor adherence to MedDiet, whereas those with a higher body mass index (BMI) had a higher risk (p=0.023).

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association of retinal hemorrhage with COVID-19 infection in children. Retrospective cohort study. Inpatients and outpatients at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, ages 1 month to 18 years, who had a dilated fundus examination by an ophthalmologist within one month of a COVID-19 test between January 2020 and October 2023. Medical records were reviewed for the results of COVID-19 testing and retinal findings. Primary outcome was the association between COVID-19 and retinal hemorrhage assessed across 4 time periods: retinal exam within 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, or 28 days of COVID-19 testing. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine statistical significance and control for age and multiple COVID-19 tests. Association between COVID-19 infection and presence of retinal hemorrhage. Among 6,952 children (mean age 6.1 years) studied, 3,496, 4,758, 5,887, and 6,952 children underwent fundus exam within 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of a COVID test, respectively. There were no associations between COVID-19 infection and the presence of retinal hemorrhage in any of the time periods: 7 days (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.20-3.32; P=0.76), 14 days (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.24-2.00; P=0.63), 21 days (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.29-2.15; P=0.64), or 28 days (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.23-1.72; P=0.37). All four COVID-19 positive children with retinal hemorrhage had alternative plausible causes with hemorrhage patterns consistent with those other causes. COVID-19 infection is not associated with retinal hemorrhage in children. COVID-19 should not be considered as a potential cause of retinal hemorrhage in children, and this unsupported theory should not be accepted clinically or in legal proceedings.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has posed a substantial global public - health threat and has led to the emergence of diverse variant strains. A prevalent mutation, D614G, is commonly detected in the spike glycoprotein (S) of successive SARS- CoV-2 variants, which enhances viral infectivity. Here, the objective was to examine the influence of mutations on the synthesis and processing of the S protein, virus assembly, and infectivity. This was achieved by artificially substituting the aspartic acid at position 614 of the S protein with 19 distinct amino acids, including glycine, via codon modification. Pseudoviruses and virus-like particles were employed as models for this investigation. The results demonstrated that the expression characteristics of the modified S proteins diverged from those of the original D614 variant. Moreover, pseudoviruses with various mutations displayed different efficiencies in entering cells expressing ACE2. Significantly, the D614P and D614C mutations disrupted the production and processing of the S protein, exerting a notable impact on virus assembly. However, co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that D614 mutations did not hinder the interaction between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor. These findings emphasize the significance of D614 or G614 in S protein expression and virus assembly, providing novel targets and perspectives for the progress of research on spike-based vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Cases of Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) dropped sharply due to non-pharmaceutical interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic, raising the possibility of a disease rebound due to an immunity gap. This has been investigated via a seroprevalence study of individuals less than 25 years old, by measuring meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titres in sera collected during 2019, 2020 and 2021. SBA titres in vaccine-eligible populations since the introduction of 4CMenB were also evaluated via comparison with data obtained before vaccine introduction. Serum samples were obtained from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Seroepidemiology Unit (SEU) and stratified by age. 1656 samples were requested of which 1586 samples were available. Functional antibody levels were analysed using a standardised, validated SBA assay against serogroup B strain NZ 98/254 (B: P1.7-2,4: ST-42 (cc41/44)). Samples were excluded if they were insufficient, did not obtain a titre or showed evidence of non-complement mediated lysis. 1371 valid titres were obtained. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of individuals (all ages) with a positive titre (≥4) between 2019 and 2021. For 2019, 2020 and 2021, SBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) in infants aged 6 to 24 months were significantly higher than GMTs obtained between 2001 and 2004. Disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in antibody levels, most likely due to reduced exposure to circulating meningococci being carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx. Disruption to the routine immunisation schedule is unlikely to be a contributory factor as vaccine coverage was not significantly affected during the epidemiological year 2020 to 2021. Routine immunisation of infants has resulted in a significant increase in SBA GMTs in infants aged 6 to 24 months, compared to an age-matched population prior to the vaccine introduction.",

Nonetheless, they can pose risk of transmission as captured microbes or respiratory droplets can remain viable on filters and propagate under ideal environmental conditions. It became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic that conventional masks alone are insufficient for ensuring adequate safety and disrupting the route of spread. Equipping protective masks with antimicrobial property is fundamental to overcoming the survivability of microbes on the surface of filter media and ensuring personal safety. Consequently, this has become a significant research focus, with a sharp upsurge in publications in the COVID-19 era.

    "abstract": "Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) plants pose significant environmental concerns, generating solid by-products, namely Fly Ash (FA) and Bottom Ash (BA). These MSWI residues have received attention due to the presence of valuable elements, Potentially Toxic Elements (PTE), and other contaminants. Radionuclide detection is also critical because they can concentrate in incineration ashes to pose a radiological hazard. Therefore, multi-element and radionuclide analysis was performed on BA and FA, including samples from bag filters containing lime (FAL) and soda (FAS) additives collected from two MSWI plants in northern Italy. BA and FA were sampled in 2013, 2020, 2021, and 2022 for a multi-year assessment, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential of elemental flows and radiological impact of the two different MSWI plants. The chemical concentration of 70 elements and the activity of 8 radionuclides were determined using sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-SFMS) and alpha and gamma spectrometry, respectively. Regarding major elements (Fe, Al, Mg, Ti, and P), high mean concentrations were found in BA, followed by FAL and FAS. Notably, in BA samples, Fe, Al, Zn, and Cu averaged 47600, 35300, 4100, and 3500 mg kg-1, respectively, and critical raw materials, namely elements of economic importance such as Mg, P, Ti, and Ba, were concentrated at 16100, 6800, 3500, and 1400 mg kg-1, respectively. The annual flows of elements from MSWI residue streams ranged in the order of 103-104 kg a-1 for Fe, Al, Zn, Cu, Mg and Ti, and the sum of Rare Earth Elements (∑REE) was about hundreds of kg per year. Chondrite-normalized patterns of REE and normalized patterns of selected elements over crustal averages helped to evaluate anthropogenic signals, which enabled us to hypothesise elemental sources related to the input MSW. BA and FA showed a higher content of natural radionuclides than artificial ones. In BA, natural radionuclides, 40K and 210Pb, ranged from 666 to 693 Bq kg-1 and 23.3-48.1 Bq kg-1, respectively. In FA, 40K ranged from 308 to 2198 Bq kg-1 and 210Pb from 17.1 to 534 Bq kg-1. Activity concentration index (ACI) results in all-natural radionuclides below the permissible limit (<1). Still, the significant abundance of 210Pb and 40K, coupled with their complex behaviour, calls for new and continuous evaluation of long-term emissions and the radiological hazard related to MSWI systems.",

This review investigates therapeutic plasma exchange as a potential strategy to mitigate COVID-19-induced thrombotic microangiopathy, examining its role in removing pro-inflammatory cytokines, immune complexes, and pro-thrombotic factors. Additionally, it highlights the synergistic effects when therapeutic plasma exchange is combined with treatments such as complement inhibitors and immunosuppressants. Preliminary evidence, drawn from case reports and early trials, supports the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in improving outcomes for COVID-19-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.

This paper explores the application of an online variant of Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (O-SMC2) to the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for real-time epidemic tracking. The advantage of O-SMC2 lies in its ability to update parameter estimates using a particle Metropolis-Hastings kernel by only utilizing a fixed window of recent observations. This feature enables timely parameter updates and significantly enhances computational efficiency compared to standard SMC2, which requires processing all past observations. First, we demonstrate the efficiency of O-SMC2 on simulated epidemic data, where both the true parameter values and the observation process are known. We then make an application to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from Ireland, successfully tracking the epidemic and estimating a time-dependent reproduction number of the disease. Our results show that O-SMC2 provides accurate online estimates of both static and dynamic epidemiological parameters while substantially reducing computational cost. These findings highlight the potential of O-SMC2 for real-time epidemic monitoring and supporting adaptive public health interventions.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 244 consecutive adult patients with respiratory symptoms at Nanlian Community Health Center (January-March 2024). Throat swabs were analyzed for 18 respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR. Hematological parameters, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), were measured from blood counts. The primary outcome was infection status (uninfected, single, or mixed). Multinomial logistic regression models identified factors associated with infection patterns. The initial cohort included 294 patients and 5,292 pathogen test results, with 319 (6.0 %) positive for at least one of 18 targeted pathogens. The most common pathogens in mixed infections were Influenza A Virus (25.1 %), H3N2 (23.5 %), and Haemophilus influenzae (22.3 %). After excluding 50 cases with incomplete questionnaires, the analytical cohort consisted of 244 participants (83.0 % of total), 56.1 % of whom were female. The largest age group was 19-40 years (71.3 %), and 65 participants (26.6 %) had mixed infections. Higher symptom counts (adjusted OR=1.700, 95 % CI 1.346-2.147) and elevated NLR (adjusted OR=1.232, 95 % CI 1.068-1.422) were linked to mixed infections. SARS-CoV-2 co-infection was negatively associated with mixed infections (adjusted OR=0.141, 95 % CI 0.035-0.575). Mixed infections correlate with greater symptom burden and higher inflammation markers. The inverse relationship with SARS-CoV-2 warrants further investigation.

Although ICU nurses have many responsibilities that impact patient outcomes, little is known about how the severity of a patient's illness influences the time and activities that nurses dedicate to primary care within a medical ICU. Data collection was set for February to April 2020, as suspended on March 11 due to COVID-19. It resumed on July 6, 2020, after clinical research activities were reinstated. We collected data for a time-motion study. We combined the manual observation data with the real-time location data of a Near Field Electromagnetic Ranging (NFER) system to analyze how time is structured in primary care. Our goal was to investigate the impact of a patient's illness severity on how time is allocated in intensive care nursing. Overall, there was no significant difference between February and July in terms of time spent on primary care and peer support activities. However, for specific primary-care tasks, ICU nurses spent less time on patient assessment, patient care, and medication tasks compared to February, significantly more time on patient transport in July. In the February data, we found a significant correlation between the SOFA score and the time devoted to primary care, indicating a meaningful association between patient illness severity and the allocation of nursing time. However, in the July data, no correlation was found between the SOFA score and the time spent on primary care. These findings improve our understanding of the challenges that nurses experience in medical ICU units, emphasizing the necessary adjustments to enhance nursing care.",

The Vaccine Confidence Network (VCN) process evaluation collected progress and performance data on Prevention Research Centers' (PRCs) work to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, increase vaccine confidence and demand in populations of focus, and engage communities. Data were collected mid-cycle (November 2021) and at cycle end (December 2022). Qualitative data were also collected from July-August 2023 for a Community Engagement (CE) study via role-specific interviews with long-standing members of PRC Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and PRC Principal Investigators about creating and nurturing partnerships, trust, and COVID-19 readiness to respond. Key strategies reported by CABs and PRC investigators for building and maintaining trust in community-academic partnerships included frequent and transparent communication, active engagement of CABs in PRCs' research, ensuring partnerships are bi-directional and mutually beneficial, and investing in relationship building, including long-term commitments with partner organizations. Reported barriers to building trust included historical distrust of academic partners, competing priorities, short funding cycles, and lack of community compensation. Due to longstanding community partnerships, PRCs were seen as reliable sources of COVID-19 information in their communities and were able to help increase vaccine confidence and demand for COVID-19 vaccines through community engagement. They used a variety of strategies, including collaborative intervention development, dissemination of information through trusted messengers, and developing culturally appropriate messaging. PRCs identified having existing community partnerships as critical to PRC efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and demand.

Among 369 subjects who received 3 months of SIM01, a gut microbiota-derived synbiotic formula of three Bifidobacterium strains (B. adolescentis, B. bididum, and B. longum) or a placebo after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or the inactivated vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac), we performed metagenomic sequencing in stool samples of 280 vaccinees collected at baseline and 3-month postvaccination and metabonomic sequencing in 276 vaccinees collected at baseline and 1-month postvaccination. The open niche of autochthonous gut microbiota (lower levels of Bifidobacterium and decreased functional potential for carbohydrate metabolism) was associated with enhancing SIM01-contained species. The enrichment of three bifidobacterial species after 3 months of SIM01 intervention (BABBBL_fc) was positively correlated with the level of neutralizing antibodies to the BNT162b2 vaccine at 6-month postvaccination. The fold change of benzoic acid was positively correlated with BABBBL_fc in the BNT162b2 vaccinees, which was also implicated with SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)% levels at 1-month postvaccination. Importantly, SIM01 strain engraftment assessed by StrainPhlAn (A metagenomic strain-level population genomics tool) was associated with a higher fold change of three bifidobacterial species and could be predicted based on the baseline gut microbiome. Therefore, the resident gut microbiome affected the SIM01 engraftment, which was associated with the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccines.",

Capillary leakage, as reflected by the albumin transudation rate (ATR), may have implications for fluid dynamics and patient outcomes in these conditions. We sought to describe and compare ATR in these two related pathologies, but clinically distinct conditions. This study was conducted in 2022 across three ICUs and included 36 patients (18 with COVID-19 and 18 with sepsis). The local ethical committees approved the study. ATR, total blood volume (TBV), red blood cell volume (RBCV), and plasma volume (PV) were measured at multiple time points (Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10) using a 131I-albumin tracer. Data were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multivariate linear regression to identify predictors of ATR. ATR was significantly higher in patients with sepsis compared to those with COVID-19 throughout the ICU stay, despite lower admission severity scores in the sepsis group. Clinical assessments of the volume status frequently misclassify TBV in patients with COVID-19 or sepsis. Patients were often deemed hypervolemic when, by objective measures, they were hypovolemic under both conditions. ATR was persistently elevated in critically ill patients with sepsis and COVID-19. Sepsis exhibited significantly higher ATR values, suggesting a more pronounced endothelial dysfunction. There is a frequent inaccuracy in clinical fluid status assessment, which demands more reliable diagnostic tools to better guide fluid therapy in critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is primarily associated with respiratory illness but can also affect multiple organ systems, including the endocrine system. Viral entry into endocrine tissues may lead to immune activation and trigger or unmask autoimmune conditions in individuals who are genetically predisposed. Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 2 (APS-2), a rare disorder characterized by autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), may represent one such manifestation. We report the case of a 36-year-old male who developed APS-2 following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two months post-infection, the patient experienced asthenia, hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss. Laboratory investigations revealed undetectable morning cortisol, positive 21-hydroxylase and thyroid-peroxidase autoantibodies, elevated ACTH and renin, and subclinical hypothyroidism-consistent with a diagnosis of APS-2 (AAD and Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Treatment with cortisone acetate and fludrocortisone led to clinical improvement. No previous history of autoimmune disease was reported. A review of the literature identified only four similar case reports, with varying timelines between SARS-CoV-2 infection and APS-2 diagnosis, suggesting that the infection may act as a trigger in predisposed individuals. This case adds to limited evidence suggesting a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the onset or unmasking of APS-2. While a direct causal role of the virus remains uncertain, SARS-CoV-2 may function as an environmental trigger, accelerating the transition from subclinical to clinical autoimmunity in genetically susceptible patients. This observation supports the need for clinical vigilance in post-COVID-19 patients presenting with nonspecific but suggestive endocrine symptoms.",

    "title": "Community perspectives on access to maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Western Kenya: a qualitative study.",
    "abstract": "Globally, maternal and child health outcomes were negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited qualitative evidence focused on access to maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural sub-Saharan African populations. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring key community perspectives on access to maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural western Kenya. We conducted five focus group discussions and sixty one in-depth interviews. Participants were mothers who delivered in 2020 during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and rural community health workers (CHWs) in Siaya and Kisii counties. The three-delay model framework helped to guide discussions around access to maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural western Kenya. We transcribed the data and conducted a thematic content analysis. According to CHWs and expectant mothers, fear and misconceptions about COVID-19 were associated with delays in making the decision to seek maternal health care. Lockdowns, movement restrictions, and curfews made it challenging to physically reach health facilities. The shortage of drugs and supplies and an insufficient number of healthcare workers in health facilities were barriers to care seeking. The quality of maternal health services was perceived to have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers reported the Linda Mama health insurance program helped them pay for maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, out-of-pocket expenses were common. As reported by mothers, CHWs when engaged and active, helped alleviate access challenges by serving as a link to the health system. There were significant socio-economic difficulties experienced by community members because of closed businesses and schools. Community perspectives revealed significant challenges with accessing maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural western Kenya. The pandemic amplified each of three delays in accessing care leading to poorer access to maternal health services. The overriding perception among mothers was that CHWs helped mitigate challenges around access to health services. CHWs should be included in future pandemic preparedness and response efforts.",

    "abstract": "Long-term health consequences of COVID-19, particularly among individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases, are not fully understood. This study investigates whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of developing multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) and evaluates protective effects of vaccination. We analyzed territory-wide electronic health records from Hong Kong, linking Hospital Authority data with COVID-19 infection and vaccination records from the Department of Health. A retrospective matched-cohort study was conducted among patients with one pre-existing chronic condition. Participants were stratified into three groups: (1) no documented COVID-19 infection, (2) COVID-19 infection with incomplete vaccination (<3 doses), and (3) COVID-19 infection with full vaccination (≥3 doses). The primary outcome was the incidence of a second chronic condition from a pre-specified list. Among 1,038,175 eligible individuals, 68,975 (6.64%) developed multimorbidity over a median follow-up of 192 days (IQR: 96-313). The non-COVID-19 group (51,288 cases) had an incidence rate of 68.88 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 68.18-69.37). In contrast, the COVID-19/unvaccinated group (9455 cases) exhibited a significantly higher rate (86.58; 95% CI: 84.85-88.35). The COVID-19/vaccinated group (8232 cases) showed a moderated rate (72.84; 95% CI: 71.27-74.43). Adjusted incidence rate ratios were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.23-1.29) for unvaccinated and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05-1.11) for vaccinated individuals compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Results remained consistent across age, sex, and comorbidity subgroups. COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity in patients with pre-existing conditions. Full vaccination attenuates this risk substantially, highlighting its critical role in mitigating post-infection complications.",

We used plasma samples from an infection and vaccination-naive cohort study with RT-PCR confirmed ancestral B.1* SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with asymptomatic or mild disease, collected in Hong Kong between March to December 2020, from acute (0-14 days post infection) to convalescent (15-206 days) timepoints. Children had significantly lower primary antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 proteins overall, leading to a less isotype switched response. While children had lower OC43 Spike and SARS-CoV-2 S2 IgG and avidity than adults, they exhibited higher avidities for SARS-CoV-2 whole Spike and Nucleocapsid, and higher levels of Spike FcγR-binding antibodies. Adults' SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses could be derived from high avidity pre-existing cross-reactive common cold coronavirus B cell responses, whilst children appear to generate a de novo SARS-CoV-2- specific Spike and Nucleocapsid IgG with robust Fc receptor (FcR) binding ability and high avidity at a higher proportion than adults, thus their responses are more targeted and functional for SARS-CoV-2.",

Following the match, a survey was performed to evaluate experiences among applicants and program directors (PDs). Surveys were developed within the BSO Fellowship Program Directors Committee and distributed via email to matched applicants and PDs from 18 July 2024 to 9 August 2024. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Of the 89 matched applicants, 60 completed the survey (response rate 67.4%). Most applicants (76.7%, n = 46) preferred in-person over virtual interviews. The top reason for preferring in-person was 'to see the program in person' (56.7%, n = 34). Nearly half of applicants (48.3%, n = 29) estimated spending ≥$5000 on interviews, and 78.3% (n = 47) indicated the cost was 'worth it'. Over half of applicants (51.7%, n = 31) reported interview style had an impact on their match. Of the 64 PDs, 38 completed the survey (response rate 59.4%). Virtual interviews were the most common format (65.8%, n = 25). The most important factor reported by most programs regarding the interview approach was cost to applicants (42.1%, n = 16). Over half of PDs (52.6%, n = 20) felt the interview approach influenced the match. The majority of 2024 BSO fellowship matched applicants preferred in-person interviews, noting the importance of location, faculty, and culture to their decision making. This data may assist PDs in choosing the interview approach best suited for their programs and guide training programs more broadly.",

This period reshaped many facets of drug and vaccine development, as well as the regulatory review process, fostering innovations while maintaining standards of safety, quality, and efficacy. To capture and document these innovative methods and key takeaways in nonclinical development for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines, the DruSafe Leadership Group of the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ Consortium) conducted a survey among its members with experience in developing COVID-19 treatments and preventatives. The survey captured how companies used innovative nonclinical strategies to expedite the availability of promising drugs and vaccines in response to the urgent medical need, as well as their interactions with regulatory agencies. This article presents the survey results, offering insights into nonclinical development for 15 therapeutics or vaccines submitted by 10 pharmaceutical companies.

    "abstract": "In 2021, rapid rollout of two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reduced COVID-19 severity and mortality. However, further vaccine doses as a prime-boost schedule were limited, and lifting of public health restrictions by late 2021 frequently led to infection, rather than vaccine, as a third exposure. To compare how third exposure through mRNA booster or SARS-CoV-2 infection shapes humoral and cellular immunity following two vaccine doses. We compared immune responses after third exposure in healthy adults enrolled in the UCLH-Crick Legacy cohort study (NCT04750356) between those receiving ancestral spike-encoded mRNA booster (vaccine immunity, n = 38) or COVID-19 infection (hybrid immunity, n = 13) following two vaccine doses. Immune profiles were evaluated using live virus neutralization assays, IFN-γ ELISpot, Luminex assay, flow cytometry and mass cytometry. Both total anti-Spike IgG and variant-specific neutralising antibodies were comparable following infection or vaccine as a third exposure. Overall, T cell populations were similar, but functionally different. CD8⁺ Effector Memory (TEM) cells in the vaccine group showed higher expression of CD69 and Granzyme B following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides. In contrast, the hybrid group produced higher levels of innate immune associated cytokines IL-10 and IL-34, as well as the T cell homing chemokine CCL25, after stimulation. While both exposures generated comparable breadth of protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants, our findings suggest that the route of third exposure influences different aspects of the immune response, warranting further investigation into long-term immunity at both systemic and mucosal sites.",

    "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is characterized by persistent cognitive deficits alongside anxiety and depression symptoms that adversely affect quality of life. Cognitive training (CT) programs and non-invasive neuromodulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have each shown promise for alleviating similar deficits in non-clinical populations. However, their combined efficacy has not yet been evaluated in PASC patients. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether the combination of CT and tDCS produces benefits for cognitive and mood-related symptoms in individuals with PASC. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial in adults aged 18-75 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past six months and persisting cognitive complaints. They were randomized to a 4-week in-person intervention of 20 weekday sessions of either active (2 mA anodal-left, cathodal-right prefrontal stimulation) or sham tDCS paired with an app-based CT program. Primary outcomes were six standardized neuropsychological tests assessing verbal memory, working memory, executive functioning, attention, and language, administered at baseline and immediately post-intervention. As secondary outcomes, we assessed changes in depression and anxiety symptoms over the treatment period. Sixty participants (mean age 43.8 ± 13.2 years, 71.7% women) were randomized to active tDCS + CT or sham tDCS + CT groups, and 52 finished the trial. Compared to sham, tDCS + CT resulted in significantly greater improvement in tests evaluating inhibitory control (effect size [ES] = 0.07, 95% CI 0 to 0.23, p = 0.046), processing speed (ES = 0.08, 95% CI 0 to 0.25, p = 0.034), and divided attention (ES = 0.08, 95% CI 0 to 0.24, p = 0.039), but not in tests evaluating other domains. Both groups improved similarly in depression and anxiety symptoms. Participant's and rater's active guess rates did not differ between groups (ps > 0.20). An intervention with prefrontal targeted tDCS + CT in patients with PASC with cognitive complaints might be effective in improving attention, processing speed and inhibitory control, although further studies are warranted to prospectively confirm these findings.

    "abstract": "USP10 is a critical deubiquitinating enzyme within the ubiquitin-specific protease family, playing multifaceted roles in cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis. Structurally composed of a G3BP1-interacting motif, a N-terminal domain (mediating most protein interactions), and a catalytic USP domain (residues 415-795, catalytic triad C424-H736-D751), USP10 regulates diverse cellular pathways by stabilizing key proteins through deubiquitination. It exhibits context-dependent functional duality, particularly in cancer: USP10 promotes tumorigenesis in various cancers (e.g., glioblastoma, esophageal, pancreatic, breast cancers) by stabilizing oncoproteins like CCND1, YAP1, HDAC7, and RUNX1, enhancing proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion. Conversely, it suppresses tumors (e.g., NSCLC, CRC, thyroid cancer) by stabilizing tumor suppressors like p53, PTEN, and Axin1, inhibiting pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin. Beyond oncology, USP10 contributes to neurodegenerative diseases (neuroprotective in PD/ALS, neurotoxic in AD via Tau stabilization), viral immunity (inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection), inflammatory responses, male reproduction, and metabolic/cardiovascular disorders. Its regulatory mechanisms include phosphorylation (e.g., by AMPK, AKT, ATM) controlling subcellular localization and activity, and ubiquitination via USP13. USP10's therapeutic significance drives inhibitor development (Spautin-1, D1, Wu-5, P22077, Parthenolide), though cross-reactivity within the USP family due to conserved catalytic domains remains a challenge. Novel strategies like PROTACs and engineered ubiquitin variants (UbVs) offer promise for future selective targeting of USP10 dysregulation in diverse diseases. A comprehensive understanding of its structure and context-specific functions is essential for exploiting its full therapeutic potential.",

The initial pharmacokinetic assessment involved biophysical characterization of the interaction between human serum albumin (HSA), the main globular protein responsible for drug distribution, using circular dichroism (CD), steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, combined with in silico calculations. Monomethoxyxanthone 3 exhibited the highest potency (37.37 ± 1.25 μM) against T. cruzi amastigotes, likely due to its ability to form the most hydrogen bonds with TcPTR1. Both HSA:1-3 interactions involved spontaneous and strong binding, with minimal disruption to albumin's secondary structure. The methoxy group at position 4 of the xanthone aromatic ring reduces binding affinity by approximately tenfold. Nonetheless, all methoxyxanthones demonstrated higher binding affinity than the reported synthetic dimethoxyxanthones. The main binding site was identified in the positive electrostatic potential pocket in subdomain IIA (site I), suggesting that compounds 1-3 could be transported in the human bloodstream via albumin.",

Early and accurate detection of these viruses is crucial for curbing their respiratory transmission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a reliable, rapid, sensitive, and user-friendly tool for detecting multiple respiratory pathogens. Here, we present a triple-channel immunochromatographic system (TCIS) based on quantum dot fluorescent microspheres (QDFM), which includes immunochromatographic test strips and a detection platform integrated with optical and electronic modules. The TCIS utilizes a smartphone for fluorescence image extraction and filtering algorithms, enabling automatic image denoising and quantitative data analysis. Combined with high quantum yield luminescent materials, the system significantly enhances detection sensitivity. The limits of detection (LODs) for Flu B nucleoprotein, Flu A nucleoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2 N protein were as low as 0.301 ng/mL, 0.227 ng/mL, and 0.348 ng/mL, respectively. To evaluate its clinical performance, we tested saliva samples from 15 Flu A patients and 20 healthy controls, demonstrating a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 95.2 %. This work highlights the potential of TCIS as an efficient, accessible, and accurate home-based diagnostic tool, offering a promising solution for early diagnosis.",

During the initial randomized treatment periods of these studies, vutrisiran was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. This pooled safety analysis aimed to evaluate the safety of vutrisiran in a large population of patients with hereditary ATTR and wild-type ATTR who received treatment for up to 58 months in HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B. Data from patients who received at least one dose of vutrisiran at any time during the HELIOS-A or HELIOS-B studies were included in this pooled safety analysis. For reference, data from the external placebo arm of HELIOS-A (APOLLO placebo) and the placebo arm of HELIOS-B studies were included. Exposure-adjusted adverse event rates (AERs) and serious AERs were calculated per 100 patient-years. The combined vutrisiran group comprised 707 patients (HELIOS-A vutrisiran group: n = 160; HELIOS-B vutrisiran group: n = 547) with a mean age at symptom onset of 68.5 years; 30.3% had hereditary ATTR. These patients had a median (range) treatment duration of 33.4 months (0.0-57.8) and a cumulative exposure of 1,518.9 patient-years. In the combined vutrisiran group, AERs and serious AERs for specific adverse events were comparable to those reported in either of the placebo reference groups and those previously reported during the initial randomized treatment periods of the HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B studies. AERs for cardiac failure, the most common adverse event in vutrisiran-treated patients excluding COVID-19, were lower in the HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B vutrisiran groups than in the corresponding placebo groups. Injection-site reactions were infrequent and mild or moderate in severity. There were no ocular, hepatic, or renal safety concerns with vutrisiran treatment. In a broad population of patients with ATTR who were treated for up to 58 months, vutrisiran was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that previously reported for the HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B studies.",

    "abstract": "Causative agent, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires a host for its infection, replication, and spread. With the availability of several animal models and their limitations, there is a need for an alternative animal model with a high degree of conserved synteny at a laboratory scale. Zebrafish resemble humans in terms of conserved genetic homology aiding to understand the viral pathology and screening a variety of drug molecules. For e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 transmission was well established via air, infected people, and other surfaces. However, the viral titers in domestic sewage of infected people's excrements transmission through the water bodies were not well studied with a suitable model system. Thus, in the present study, we explore zebrafish as a potential host for SARS-CoV-2 like viruses entry, pathophysiology, transmission, and preclinical assessment of drugs involved in immune response and viral load reduction against SARS-CoV like viruses.",

    "abstract": "Despite effective antiviral drugs that have emerged to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections, novel therapeutic strategies are required to better address the ongoing and future evolutions of the virus. Targeting viral proteases, such as the main protease (Mpro), remains a promising approach. Here, we present a rapid and sensitive luminescence-based reporter system, the i-NSP4/5-Gluc2, to assess Mpro activity. This system employs Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) fused to a pro-interleukin 1β (pro-IL-1β) fragment containing a specific Mpro cleavage site. Upon Mpro cleavage, Gluc is released and secreted, generating a luminescent signal outside the cells. By optimizing the system's design and experimental conditions, we achieved high sensitivity and specificity. The i-NSP4/5-Gluc2 system was validated using the Mpro inhibitor Nirmatrelvir and successfully identified potential Mpro inhibitors from a small library of 46 compounds, as proof of concept. Notably, 13 out of 14 new compounds identified by the i-NSP4/5-Gluc2 assay exhibited potent antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the system's accuracy and predictive power. This BSL2-compatible, high-throughput approach facilitates rapid and efficient screening of antiviral compounds, accelerating the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and future viral pandemics.",

    "abstract": "The complement-activated product (C5a) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While blocking C5a represents a promising therapeutic strategy, novel anti-C5a therapies require further development. This study aimed to develop a novel, human anti-C5a monoclonal antibody (STSA-1002) and evaluate its efficacy in treating ARDS through in vitro and vivo studies. In vitro, STSA-1002 exhibited high binding affinity to human and rhesus monkey C5a (EC50: 29.41 ± 10.74 ng/mL and 32.29 ± 10.96 ng/mL, respectively) and effectively inhibited C5a-induced neutrophil degranulation, chemotaxis, and CD11b expression. In vivo, single intravenous administration of STSA-1002 (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and mortality in a COVID-19-related LPS-induced ARDS mouse model (Model 1). In a second LPS-induced ARDS model (Model 2), STSA-1002 (1, 5 and 25 mg/kg) significantly reduced IL-6, TNF-α concentrations and leukocyte counts in serum and diminished IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alongside improvements in lung weight index. In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated linear exposure (5-50 mg/kg) and a favorable safety profile in a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. These results furnish comprehensive preclinical evidence for STSA-1002 as an innovative anti-C5a therapeutic agent and provide a preliminary rationale for developing immunomodulatory therapy in ARDS.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has posed significant global health challenges and there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic agents. The main protease (Mpro) plays a crucial role in viral replication, making it an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. In this study, by screening over 8.06 million compounds obtained from Enamine, Vitas-M, ChemDiv, and TargetMol (USA) databases, 52 top-ranking compounds were obtained as promising candidates through molecular docking, followed by Uni-QSAR modeling and ADMET predictions to evaluate their binding affinities and pharmacokinetic properties. Biological activity assays confirmed the efficacy of four standout candidates L17, L26, L37, and L50 with IC50 values of 5.61 ± 0.58 μM, 6.00 ± 0.63 μM, 4.21 ± 0.89 μM, and 2.84 ± 1.20 μM, respectively, comparable to that of reference ML188 (2.41 ± 0.70 μM). Further insights were gained through density functional theory (DFT) analyses, which provided valuable information regarding the electronic and structural properties of the candidate compounds. Additionally, extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted, revealing critical information about the stability and binding interactions of the compounds within the Mpro active site over a 500 ns simulation period. Besides, the results of binding free energy calculations demonstrated that compounds had higher binding affinity than ML188, and dcTMD simulations further revealed that L26, L37, and L50 followed more favorable and cooperative unbinding pathways with higher energy barriers and lower dissipation compared to ML188. Overall, the results highlight the therapeutic potential of these compounds as effective Mpro inhibitors, laying a solid foundation for further development into novel antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "title": "Large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from sewage using eVarEPS reveals that amino acid mutations detected in sewage provide an early warning on population prevalence.",
    "abstract": "Key amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes drive the emergence of variants of concern, impacting virus transmission and immune escape. However, there is still a lack of large-scale monitoring and risk assessment of new amino acid variants in sewage. To address this gap, we developed eVarEPS (Environmental SARS-CoV-2 Variations Evaluation and Prewarning System), a system for the early identification and assessment of SARS-CoV-2 variants in environmental samples. We identified new amino acid mutations in 27,762 sewage sequencing datasets from public databases and published literature and carried out risk assessment of these variants. In addition, we collected 1976 sewage samples and 3817 human samples from Shenzhen from November 2022 to January 2024, employing eVarEPS to monitor and assess the risk of new variants. Using eVarEPS, we detected 5543 unique amino acid variants in global sewage samples, and multi-dimensional risk assessment of amino acid variants suggested that the variants with strong receptor affinity, weak neutralizing antibody affinity, and low difficulty of amino acid change were more likely to spread in the population (P < 0.01). We identified 1345 high-risk variants specifically identified in sewage, which should be focused on. We identified variants detected in sewage an average of 147 days earlier than in human populations, with 46.62% of these new amino acid variants subsequently spreading in the population. In addition, risk assessment showed amino acid variations with higher risk are more likely to prevail in the population (64.93 %, P < 0.001). Application of eVarEPS in the Shenzhen region, we detected the characteristic 19 amino acid variants of major lineages in Shenzhen sewage, one month to one year earlier than the discovery of the corresponding lineages. We conclude that tracking new SARS-CoV-2 amino acid variants in sewage offers more sensitive and timely insights into population prevalence. High-risk mutations identified by eVarEPS are more likely to spread and should be closely monitored. This study enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variation dynamics and provides an efficient method for future pathogen monitoring and early warning. eVarEPS has been developed into a database and online tool that can be freely accessed at https://nmdc.cn/ncovn/analyze/eVarEPS.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, there were reports that HIV antiretrovirals, specifically the combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), had therapeutic potential for COVID-19. In the context of scant empirical evidence at the time to confirm such an effect, we sought to understand the ways that gay and bisexual men (GBM) made sense of-and embodied-information about HIV antiretrovirals in relation to preventing and/or treating COVID-19. We conducted interviews with 26 participants between August and November 2020. To understand how information about, and experiences of, consuming antiretrovirals might form part of assemblages of COVID-19 prevention for GBM in Australia, we draw on Marsha Rosengarten's (2009) concept of 'informed matter'. 'Informed matter' conceptualises the subject (of disease prevention) as involved in a co-constitutive relationship with the contextual dynamics in which it is situated. Participants drew on their understandings of virology, immunology and pharmaceuticals and experiences with antiretrovirals to form perceptions about their function as therapeutics for COVID-19. By looking beyond biotechnologies as causal of behaviour, we can avoid unintended moralism in contexts of potentially different use. We argue that using 'informed matter' is useful to interrogate, often neglected, complex changes in sex-associated biotechnologies in complicated informational contexts, such as a global pandemic.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we use constructivism to explore community members' accounts of how socio-cultural and behavioral factors provided meaning to the COVID-19 pandemic in Papua New Guinea, adherence to \"niupela pasin\" (new normal), and vaccination acceptance. We purposively selected 50 participants including community members, leaders, and church representatives for semi-structured interviews from urban and rural areas of Madang and Eastern Highlands Provinces. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The findings showed how people applied risk prevention strategies and actively sought localized solutions to deal with the pandemic. The pandemic also disrupted socio-cultural norms, such as communal gatherings, care for the sick, and attending funerals, leading to distress and interruptions of interpersonal relationships and extended family structures. Economic hardship, particularly during lockdowns, disproportionately affected those people from lower socioeconomic levels. Strong Christian faith and prayer played a key role in either adhering to \"niupela pasin\" and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance or rejection of the vaccine. Conspiracy theories and misinformation often propagated through social media, fueled fears and doubts about vaccine efficacy. By articulating and understanding these culturally informed findings, the paper demonstrates how people undertook ordinary theorizing about their worlds to contextualize, modify, or significantly change the policies and strategies developed by experts using conventional science. Preparation for future pandemics can be enhanced by adding to public health policies and guidelines community perspectives and health promotion principles from the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.",

Of 2,624 records, 22 studies (20 cross-sectional, 2 cohort) were included, 95.46% at low risk of bias but methodologically diverse. Heightened anxiety, depression, and stress were linked to emotional or uncontrolled eating and increased ultra-processed food intake. A small subset (13.64%) reported atypical patterns, such as reduced dessert consumption or increased consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods. Pandemic-related disruptions appeared to exacerbate psychological-disstress-induced dietary changes.

    "abstract": "Variation in the way information about potential trial intervention benefits and harms is conveyed within patient information leaflets can cause avoidable information-induced ('nocebo') harm, research waste, and may be unethical. 1. To develop stakeholder-informed principles to guide how to describe information about potential trial intervention benefits and harms within patient information leaflets. 2. To test whether using these principles are feasible for testing in trials that measure whether they improve recruitment and adverse event rates. 3. To develop and disseminate guidance on how to implement the principles. We used a mixed methodology consisting of three work packages. Work package 1 involved a modified Delphi survey and consensus meeting to develop the principles for harmonising the way information regarding potential benefits and harms are shared. Work package 2 involved testing whether the principles could be used to transform existing patient information leaflets by recruiting host trials to compare standard patient information leaflets with patient information leaflets developed using the principles 'principled patient information leaflets'. We also set up an infrastructure to test whether they could reduce variation, impact trial recruitment and reduce reported adverse events. Work package 3 involved developing and disseminating guidance for using the principles. For work package 1, 250 participants completed the Delphi survey and 7 principles were agreed upon: (1) all potential intervention harms should be listed, (2) potential harms should be separated into 'serious' and 'less serious', (3) if not all potential harms are known, this needs to be explicitly stated, (4) all potential benefits should be listed, (5) potential benefits and harms associated with trial participation need to be compared with those associated with non-participation, (6) suitable visual representations should be added where appropriate, and (7) information about potential benefits and harms should not be separated by more than one page. For work package 2, we developed principled patient information leaflets for five host trials and interviewed two members of each host trial team. Two host trials agreed to compare the patient information leaflets with principled patient information leaflets using Studies Within a Trial, and we published a protocol for a meta-analysis that will synthesise the results. For work package 3, 25 participants attended a hybrid workshop and recommended that researchers and Research Ethics Committee members should use the principles to design and evaluate patient information leaflets. We produced a guidance booklet and website, which are currently being used by some Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committees. A strong consensus was reached regarding seven principles that can harmonise the way information about the potential benefits and harms of trial interventions is shared. The principles are likely to reduce research waste and avoidable information-induced harm, and may enhance clinical trial ethics. Due to COVID-19, the National Institute for Health and Care Research review of ongoing trials that resulted in funding termination for several trials, and highly pressured trial staff with limited capacity to add Studies Within a Trial to their trials, we had to modify our second objective. Whereas we initially intended to actually conduct the Studies Within a Trial, we replaced this with: a protocol for a meta-analysis of Studies Within a Trial, additional research on the need to reduce variation, additional dissemination work, and a paper on the ethical requirement to mention potential benefits and harms of trial interventions in patient information leaflets. Future work could apply these results to explore how to harmonise the way potential benefits and harms are shared during verbal conversations between researchers and patients during the informed consent process. This award was funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Better Methods, Better Research programme (MRC Award Reference: MR/V020706/1) and is published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 29, No. 43. Researchers sometimes fail to tell participants about the possible benefits of taking a trial treatment. However, participants are almost always told about the potential harms. This imbalance can cause people to develop overly negative beliefs about treatments, which can have negative consequences. For example, worrying about a headache or nausea can cause mild headaches or nausea. Negative effects caused by negative beliefs are called ‘nocebo’ effects. The opposite can also occur. W ithout enough information, participants can develop overly positive expectations about treatment benefits. We investigated how to ensure that the information shared with participants about potential benefits and harms is understandable, honest, ethical and balanced. We surveyed a variety of stakeholders to understand what information about the possible benefits and harms they would like to know. We focused on the written information provided within patient information leaflets. The stakeholders included trial participants, ethics committee members, researchers, trial nurses, industry representatives and legal experts. Our survey identified a widespread agreement on seven principles to use when writing about possible benefits and harms within patient information leaflets: All potential intervention harms should be listed. Potential harms should be separated into ‘serious’ and ‘less serious’ categories. If all potential harms are not known, this should be explicitly stated. All potential benefits should be listed. The potential benefits and harms associated with participation need to be compared with those associated with non-participation. Suitable visual representations should be added where appropriate. The information about potential benefits and harms should be presented in proximity to one another. We then developed user-friendly guidance so that the principles could be easily used. We also laid the foundation for future tests on whether these principles reduce ‘nocebo’ effects. Researchers and ethics committees will now have clear guidance to follow when they write about possible benefits and harms within patient information leaflets. This will save time and make patient information leaflets more ethical. The principles will also help ensure that patient information leaflets do not produce unnecessary ‘nocebo’ effects.",

    "abstract": "The Syrian crisis, severe economic conditions, and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the mental health of Syrians, including mothers who have given birth during these difficult times. These conditions have led to an increased prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD), exacerbated by inadequate responses to these crises. The study aims to assess the prevalence of PPD among Syrian mothers during the Syrian crisis, economic crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. It also seeks to identify the influence of these factors on the occurrence of PPD. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted between November 13, 2020 and April 27, 2021, in Damascus, Syria. PPD was evaluated among women who visited the Obstetrics and Gynecology University Hospital in Damascus, using the Arabic version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale after birth and again 6 weeks later. Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression were used to investigate the correlation between the variables. A total of 402 women participated in the study, with only 378 remaining for follow-up at 6 weeks postpartum. The prevalence of PPD was found to be 46% immediately after birth and 25.3% 6 weeks later. Women's house devastation (Sig. 0.033, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.043-2.801), loss or injury of family members (Sig. 0.018, 95% CI: 1.110-3.008), and a preference for a female child (Sig. 0.034, 95% CI: 0.162-0.931) were significantly associated with PPD. We did not find an impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression. Detecting and addressing PPD is crucial, especially during the Syrian crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing economic difficulties, as these factors heighten stress during the postpartum period. Particular attention should be given to displaced mothers and those who have lost family members due to the conflict.",

    "abstract": "Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, its impact on patients with migraine has revealed critical gaps in understanding how migraine interacts with respiratory infections. Exploring this bidirectional relationship is essential for improving migraine management and protecting vulnerable populations during future outbreaks. To examine (1) the impact of migraine on COVID-19 manifestations and the risk of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), and (2) the effect of COVID-19 infection on migraine features. We conducted a longitudinal study, with both prospective and retrospective data collection, nested within the Migraine Exposures and Cardiovascular Health in Hong Kong Chinese Women (MECH-HK) cohort. Two cohort-wide assessments were conducted at baseline (2019-2020) and follow-up (2021-2023). Monthly migraine features, including attack frequency, duration, and intensity, were prospectively tracked using migraine diaries. COVID-19-related outcomes, including symptom burden, self-perceived severity, time-to-test negativity, and PASC, were retrospectively self-reported during follow-up. To examine the bidirectional relationship, Substudy 1 used regression models to evaluate how baseline migraine status influenced infection-related outcomes among participants who contracted COVID-19 between baseline and follow-up. Substudy 2 used mixed-effects models to compare longitudinal changes in migraine features between the infection and noninfection groups. In Substudy 1 (n = 1085; mean age: 54.3 ± 9.4 years), women with migraine (n = 122) reported significantly greater COVID-19 symptom burden compared to participants without migraine (mild: adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.47; moderate/severe: aRR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01), higher self-perceived severity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.01-2.09), and an elevated risk of PASC (aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.23-2.82), which may suggest heightened vulnerability in this population. In Substudy 2, participants who contracted COVID-19 (n = 73) exhibited a 35% increase in the geometric mean of monthly migraine attack frequency during the first 3 months postinfection (adjusted geometric mean ratio [aGMR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.65), whereas no such increase was observed in the noninfection group (n = 128) during the corresponding period. No significant changes in attack duration or intensity were observed in either group. Migraine and COVID-19 exhibit a bidirectional relationship. Women with migraine experienced more severe COVID-19 manifestations and greater PASC risk, whereas infection was associated with increased migraine attack frequency. These findings emphasize the need for tailored migraine management strategies, particularly in the context of future viral outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Home care services, with the aim to support older adults in their homes, faced intense external pressure to create sustainable working conditions for staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have indicated elevated burnout and stress among residential care staff, and it is likely that similar challenges exist in home care services. Overall, the consequences for staff's work environment and health under the extremely strained conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic merit closer examination. Therefore, the aim is to illuminate home care workers’ experiences of their work environment and health risks while supporting older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. To gain an in-depth understanding of personal experiences during the pandemic, five focus group interviews (FG) were held in northern Sweden during spring 2022. Open-ended questions were delivered via a semi-structured interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to guide data analysis. Expanded and unclear responsibilities characterized the work environment during the pandemic. This was summarized into four sub-themes: my own health was jeopardized; a wind of change towards more responsibility; struggling between being a lifeline and being contagious; and organization and management as facilitators or hindrances. The findings underscore the importance of management strategies and organizational preparedness to support staff’s mental health and mitigate challenges during crises. The health risks associated with increased workload, stress, and mental burdens were evident in the narratives. The study emphasizes the need to strive for a good work environment, set priorities to reduce workloads and mental stress, and incorporate time for recovery among staff during crises. It is also of great importance that different authorities in healthcare and social care create effective cooperation so that information, knowledge, and policies are effectively disseminated to frontline staff who have the concrete responsibility for our elderly.

The survey asked about participants’ sexual behaviors in the previous three months, including attendance of sex-on-premises venues (SOPVs) and the use of online platforms to meet partners, as well as their knowledge and behaviors related to HIV testing and prevention. We assessed for differences in sexual behaviors and HIV testing/prevention knowledge between the mid-pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period using robust Poisson regression, including in multivariable models adjusting for age and educational attainment. The mid-pandemic survey included additional questions asking about access to HIV services and changes in perceived health status during the pandemic, which we analyzed descriptively. Participants in the mid-pandemic period were significantly less likely to report they had attended an SOPV, met a sex partner online, engaged in group sex, or had three or more partners in the past three months. However, the prevalence of other HIV-related sexual risk behaviors, including condomless anal sex and substance use in a sexual context, was unchanged compared to pre-pandemic. Among mid-pandemic survey participants, SOPV attendance and meeting a partner online were both associated with a range of sexual risk behaviors, similar to the relationship observed between these behaviors during the pre-pandemic period. We observed relatively modest differences in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors during, versus prior to, the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of minimizing disruptions to HIV prevention and sexual health services for vulnerable populations such as MSM in Peru.

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of respiratory viral infections in Henan Province, China, from 2015 to 2023, encompassing 183,771 reported cases. The predominant pathogens included influenza A virus (Flu A), accounting for 58.66% of infections, followed by influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human rhinovirus (HRV), was 19.44%, 12.00%, 9.10%, 0.44%, and 0.37%, respectively. A significantly higher detection rate was observed in males compared to females (57.22% vs. 42.78%; χ2 < 0.001). Co-infections were documented in 2.16% of cases, with the most prevalent combination being Flu A + Flu B. Notably, the co-infection cases peaked in 2023, likely due to the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) following the COVID-19 pandemic. The detailed wavelet analysis revealed distinct periodic patterns for various respiratory viruses, highlighting the necessity of adaptable vaccination strategies. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of respiratory viral epidemiology and emphasize the significance of continuous surveillance and targeted public health interventions, particularly for high-risk populations. Future research should further investigate the implications of these trends on long-term respiratory health outcomes and inform effective strategies to mitigate the burden of respiratory infections.",

    "title": "Psychological distress across the deployment cycle: comparing pre- and peri-pandemic trajectories.",
    "abstract": "To prevent military personnel from becoming vectors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pandemic, soldiers throughout the world were required to quarantine before and after deployment. This study examined whether deployment-related quarantining affected trajectories of psychological distress for German military personnel throughout the deployment cycle. Pandemic-specific mental health studies were criticised for lacking a pre-pandemic reference point. This study aims to address this gap, thus providing stronger evidence as to whether deployment-related quarantining affected psychological distress. Pre-pandemic data were pooled with peri-pandemic data. The pre-pandemic sample consisted of 96 soldiers, and the sample from the pandemic group included 95 soldiers. Both groups completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)/Mini-Symptom Checklist (Mini-SCL) at three time points: two weeks before deployment, two weeks after deployment, and at a follow-up, three to six months post-deployment. The pandemic sample participated in both pre-deployment and post-deployment quarantines, completing the Mini-SCL five times. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA assessed differences across deployment phases and time periods. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects for the within-subjects factor \"deployment phases\" and the between-subjects factor \"pre- versus peri-pandemic period,\" with a significant interaction between both factors. Follow-up analyses showed 1) differing pre- and peri-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress across the deployment cycle and 2) higher levels of psychological distress during the peri-pandemic period, except for the two-week post-deployment measurement, which coincided with the end of post-deployment quarantine. While it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact of the pandemic versus deployment-related quarantine measures, the findings suggest that the pandemic itself had a more substantial impact on psychological distress than the quarantine measures. This study underscores the importance of selecting critical measurement time points, and utilising shorter, streamlined measures in future research.",

    "abstract": "People experienced significant disruptions in their daily lives due to COVID-19, leading to pandemic fatigue, however the underlying mechanisms have rarely been investigated. This study explored the relationship between COVID-19's disruptions to daily life and pandemic fatigue by examining the potential role of perceived stress and perceived social support. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey via the Wenjuanxing online platform using a convenience sampling approach was conducted from April to May 2022 in Shanghai Municipality, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province, China. Of the 2112 initial participants, 88 invalid questionnaires were excluded due to missing key variables or logical errors, yielding 2024 valid samples included (efficiency rate of 95.8%). Moderated mediation analysis was carried out applying Hayes' PROCESS macro. COVID-19's disruptions to daily life was positively associated with pandemic fatigue (β = 0.319, p < 0.001), while perceived stress partially mediated this relationship (β = 0.107, 95% CI = [0.088, 0.128]), accounting for 33.5% of the total effect. Perceived social support moderated the direct effect of COVID-19's disruptions on pandemic fatigue (β= -0.113, p < 0.001) and the indirect effect of perceived stress by buffering its effect on pandemic fatigue (β= -0.102, p < 0.001), thus the moderated mediation effect was established. This study revealed a plausible mechanism that explains pandemic fatigue during the COVID-19 through understanding the role of perceived stress and social support, providing theoretical and practical inputs for formulating intervention strategies.",

This single-center cross-sectional cohort study evaluated cardiopulmonary function changes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) without SARS-CoV-2 infection and explored pandemic-related influencing factors. We analyzed 7,650 ACS patients undergoing complete PCI revascularization and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) between October 2018 and December 2023, stratified into pre-pandemic (cut-off: February 1, 2020), during-pandemic, and post-pandemic (cut-off: December 31, 2022) groups. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) balanced baseline characteristics, yielding 4,503 patients for analysis. Clinical/laboratory data and CPET results were compared across groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The primary CPET parameter, peak oxygen uptake per kilogram (peak VO₂/kg), was significantly lower in the during-pandemic group (15.07 ± 4.09 ml/min/kg) compared to the pre-pandemic group (15.56 ± 3.74 ml/min/kg) and the post-pandemic group (15.69 ± 4.04 ml/min/kg). Machine learning and multivariate logistic regression were used to select key variables related to cardiopulmonary function. The findings indicate that older age, female sex, higher BMI, elevated SYNTAX score, increased NT-pro BNP levels, elevated HbA1c, smoking, anxiety, and higher ACS severity classification were positively correlated with impaired cardiopulmonary function. These results highlight associations between the pandemic and cardiovascular rehabilitation outcomes, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions during healthcare crises.",

    "title": "Digital Health Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Rapid Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear a larger proportion of the global mental illness burden, have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to preexisting mental health care system deficiencies. The pandemic has also led to a considerable increase in care delivered through digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), many of which have been adapted from in-person formats. Thus, there is a need to examine their fidelity to the original format along with issues regarding usability and other challenges to and facilitators of their uptake in LMICs. As most DMHIs have been developed in high-income countries, examining their cultural adaptation to LMIC settings is also critical. The purpose of this research was to conduct a rapid scoping review of the available evidence on DMHIs for depression and anxiety, two of the most common mental disorders, in LMICs. A rapid scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) and processes for rapid reviews by Tricco et al. The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for records published between January 2020 (when COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency) and January 2025 using a search strategy developed in consultation with a liaison librarian. The pandemic accelerated the development and application of DMHIs, and this time frame was used to capture the recent literature that may have incorporated new methods of application. The search strategy was developed across three domains: (1) digital health interventions, (2) depression or anxiety, and (3) LMICs. Data were charted from the final records according to (1) intervention type; (2) discussions on fidelity, usability, and cultural adaptation; and (3) challenges to and facilitators of their uptake in LMICs. A total of 80 records were included in the final analysis, with reasons for exclusion (eg, focused on mental health in general, not being a DMHI, or not focused on LMICs) reported. Six DMHI platforms were identified: (1) mobile app, (2) the web, (3) virtual reality, (4) videoconferencing, (5) telemedicine, and (6) social media. Less than half of the records referenced fidelity (16/80, 20%), usability (29/80, 36%), and cultural adaptation (31/80, 39%). Challenges pertained to the technological system, engagement issues, structural barriers, and concerns regarding privacy and confidentiality. Facilitators included widespread mobile phone use, built-in supervision and training features, and convenience. Despite the opportunities that DMHIs offer for reducing the mental health treatment gap, further work examining and improving their fidelity, usability, and cultural adaptation is required. In addition, various challenges to the uptake of DMHIs in LMICs, including contextual issues, structural barriers, and privacy concerns, must be mitigated to avoid contributing further to the digital divide.",

    "abstract": "With frequent new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine coverage below 50 % in low-income countries, COVID-19 remains a global health challenge, underscoring the need to update evidence-based health strategies and to understand the pandemic from a historical standpoint. Brazil is an important model for study because of the initial widespread infection and subsequent high population adherence to vaccination. To compare severity outcomes in a setting of initial low vaccination and after mass vaccination (> 95 %) according to COVID-19 test positivity. A prospective study with 673 patients tested for COVID-19, followed up until final outcome, in an isolation unit in southern Brazil. We compare the main outcomes and symptoms between the three epidemic waves in Brazil. The vaccination coverage was 0.4 %, 35.0 %, and 97.6 % during the three waves, while severe cases decreased significantly from the first to the third. Black and brown ethnicity were more frequent among cases during the second wave, and lower income was associated with the second and third. In the multivariate analysis, higher heart rate and black and brown ethnicity were new factors associated with positive diagnosis and severity independently of period. As vaccination progressed, ethnicity and lower income emerged as increasingly important risk factors, uncovering complex relationships between vaccine coverage and access to information in Brazil. The present results offer a broad view of the clinical features of COVID-19 over almost the entire pandemic period and can help evaluate public policies for subsequent management decisions and strategies to reduce health inequities.",

However, viral gastroenteritis is often diagnosed based on symptoms, with etiology infrequently tested or reported, so little information exists on community-level transmission dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that norovirus (NoV) genogroup II and enterovirus (EV) viral loads in wastewater reveal transmission dynamics of these viruses. We report NoV and EV concentrations in wastewater from 363 samples between December 5 2020 and October 10 2022 (sampled every second day). Virus concentrations in wastewater were low during 2021, and increased in 2022. Wastewater recapitulated periods of increased clinical cases, and also identified silent waves of transmission. We used the measured wastewater loads to estimate the effective reproductive number (Re). The Re for both NoV and EV peaked between 1.1 and 1.2. However, the usual seasonality of NoV transmission was upended by non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to correlated transmission dynamics of NoV GII and EV during 2021-2022. This highlights the use of wastewater to understand transmission dynamics of endemic enteric viruses and estimate relevant epidemiological parameters, including Re.",

    "abstract": "Clozapine is the only truly effective treatment for refractory schizophrenia, but its use is constrained by the requirements for frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts. In the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of clozapine blood monitoring was reduced in some units from 4-weekly to 12-weekly. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of reduced monitoring in long-term clozapine patients. This was an anonymous, retrospective, observational cohort study. No restrictions were applied regarding care setting (i.e., outpatients or inpatients). All patients who registered for reduced frequency haematological monitoring from 1 March 2020 to 1 November 2022 were included and followed up till 1 August 2024. The primary outcome was death resulting from clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA). Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with mild to moderate neutropenia during the follow-up period and the proportion of patients who reverted to standard monitoring during the study period. Amongst 1025 patients, there were no cases of agranulocytosis over 3365.9 patient-years of 12-weekly blood monitoring (incident rate 0.0 per 100 person-years). There were 43 episodes of mild neutropenia (so-called amber results-1.5-2.0 × 109/L) or neutropenia (red results < 1.5 × 109/L), an overall incident rate of 1.28 per 100 person-years. During follow-up, 41 patients (4%) reverted permanently to standard 4-weekly monitoring, and 157 patients (15%) temporarily interrupted reduced frequency monitoring but restarted 12-weekly monitoring before the end of the follow-up period. In total, 42 patients (4%) died during the observation period-no death was related to agranulocytosis. Reducing the frequency of clozapine haematological monitoring to 12-weekly was safe in a group of long-term patients. No cases of agranulocytosis occurred and no deaths due to agranulocytosis were recorded. Most patients remained on extended-interval monitoring.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of virtual rheumatology care on patients’ clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization. Patients who had at least a phone-visit during the early-pandemic and enrolled in a previous survey were invited to attend this study. Through patient surveys and review of medical charts, patients’ clinical outcomes were collected, face-to-face visits in the pre-COVID-19 era (Jan 2019, 2020) and virtual care visits (VCV) in the pandemic period (Mar 2020-June 2021). Within 226 patients, the total number of rheumatology (median (IQR): 2 (2–3) vs. 3 [2, 3, 4], p < 0.001), emergency visits (19% vs. 29.3%, p:0.006) and hospital admissions (12.9% vs. 20.8%, p:0.015) due to any cause were increased during the pandemic, whereas there was no increased ER visit or admissions due to their rheumatological disease. Around 1/3 of patients reported being on more pain medication during the COVID-19-period. Failed VCV, requiring an additional in-person-visit within 60 days, was observed in 23 (8.3%) patients and 25 (3.1%) of 800 VCV. Close to 50% of the patients with failed-VCV were treated with additional steroid therapies during the pandemic. Our results support ongoing VCV with no increased healthcare utilization and a low rate of failed visits.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, quarantine, social distancing and isolation, and the consequences were likely to increase the risk of domestic violence dramatically. This study aimed to explore women's experiences of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was conducted from November 2020 to December 2022 in Mashhad, Iran. Data were collected through remote individual semi-structured interviews with 9 women who experienced perinatal domestic violence, and 7 key informants with relevant specialists, until data saturation was achieved. The data were analysed using conventional content analysis, as adopted by Graneheim and Lundman. The 4 main themes that emerged from the data analysis were \"aggravators of perinatal violence\", \"enhanced vulnerability\", \"strategies for dealing with perinatal violence\" and \"neglected needs\". The high prevalence and the adverse consequences of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis provide a golden opportunity for performing appropriate interventions. The perinatal period provides a crucial opportunity to identify and support pregnant women who have been victimized and may have lost contact with other supportive services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological and physical support, as well as social connectedness, are important strategies during the period of isolation for individuals at risk of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 vaccination is a key strategy to control the pandemic; however, complex factors, including health awareness and social cognition, influence public intention to vaccinate. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a theoretical framework for understanding vaccination behavior, but how Vaccination awareness (VA) dynamically moderates the relationship between HBM domains and vaccination intentions remains unclear. This study aims to compare the characteristics of different VA classifications and explore the key factors influencing their future COVID-19 vaccination intentions based on the HBM. Using three-wave longitudinal cohort data from 500 adults in mainland China, participants were divided into four groups based on VA states: persistent awareness (Group 1), early-only awareness (Group 2), late-emerging awareness (Group 3), and persistently unaware (Group 4). ANOVA, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the relationships between HBM constructs, social cues, and vaccination intentions. Group 1 (31.40%) had the highest education level, the COVID-19 vaccination rate (48.35%), and future vaccination intention (36.98%), with significantly higher HBM scores (perceived severity, self-efficacy, benefits) than other groups (all p < 0.001). Group 4 (27.00%) had the highest proportion of unvaccinated individuals (40.31%) and the highest perceived barriers score (M = 2.39 ± 0.73). Logistic regression showed that Group 1's future COVID-19 vaccination intention was driven by medical expert advice (OR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.47-6.45) and self-efficacy (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.53-8.87), while Group 4 relied on government advice (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02-2.40), perceived severity (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.12-3.46), and self-efficacy (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.77-5.84). Trust in social media significantly reduced Group 3's vaccination intention (OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.35). Vaccination awareness states influence vaccination decisions by moderating HBM domains and social cues. Targeted interventions should address group-specific differences, such as enhancing self-efficacy (for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4), correcting social media misinformation ( for Group 3), and strengthening government communication (for Group 4).",

However, given the SARS-CoV-2 random mutations, 3CL protease inhibitors have been studied in recent randomized controlled trials. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to compare 3CL protease inhibitors versus placebo in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central for RCTs comparing the treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Outcomes of interest were the number of patients with symptomatic resolution, recovery rates, viral load change from baseline, alleviation rates, any adverse events, and serious/severe adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI were calculated for binary outcomes, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for continuous outcomes. R version 4.3.2 was used for statistical analysis with the random effects model. Ten studies were included, comprising 8,511 patients, of whom 4,654 (55.97%) received 3CL protease inhibitors. Follow-up ranged from 21 to 29 months. In our time-to-event analysis, 3CL protease inhibitors significantly increased the rate of alleviation (HR 1.17; 95% CI [1.09;1.25]; p < 0.01), and recovery rates (HR 1.18; 95% CI [1.11;1.26]; p < 0.01) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Health literacy has recently been proposed as a resource to deal with health-related information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially the education sector was affected by the consequences of the pandemic, e.g. through school closures and reopenings by following strict hygiene regulations. During challenging times like these, school principals are the key actors in the school environment. They are not only responsible for school functioning, but school principals' behavior and attitudes are also associated with health promoting school activities. The present study aimed to assess COVID-19 health literacy levels of German school principals, and to investigate the associations of COVID-19 health literacy with the implementation of health promotion in schools during the pandemic. As part of the joined studies coordinated by the COVID-HL Network, the COVID-19 Health Literacy School Principal Survey was conducted in Germany from March to April 2021. 2187 school principals and school management team members from four German federal states participated in the online survey. The HLS-COVID-Q22 was used to assess self-reported COVID-19 health literacy. The COVID-19 related HPS implementation scale was used to measure a holistic approach to school health promotion, consisting of 3 subscales: COVID-19 related support for students, staff and school. COVID-19 health literacy levels were computed using Rasch analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of school principals' self-reported COVID-19 health literacy and the implementation of COVID-19 related health promotion in schools. School principals showed good self-reported COVID-19 health literacy. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that self-reported COVID-19 health literacy positively predicted the implementation of COVID-19 related health promotion in schools for all three subscales during the pandemic. In some regression models, the sociodemographic factors age, sex, and school type were also significant factors. German school principals had high self-reported COVID-19 health literacy. School principals' self-reported COVID-19 health literacy was a significant factor associated with the implementation of COVID-19 related health promotion in schools. The present findings underline the need to investigate the relationship of school principals' health literacy and other potential influencing factors for the implementation of health promotion in schools.",

Key variables above were used, employing both univariate and multivariate analysis. Outcomes were ICU admission and death with COVID-19. Mean age was 42 years (Standard Deviation (SD) 16.8) and 53% were males. Those admitted to hospital were older (59.2 (14.2)) than those who died (74.9 (12.0)). Increased odds ratios (95% CI) each significantly associated with ICU admission in multivariate models were, current/ex-smokers (2.4 (2.2-2.6)), males (1.8, (1.7-1.9)), and individuals with an underlying clinical condition (10.2 (7.9-13.2)). Odds of death were also significantly increased in presence of an underlying condition (186.129 (137.987-251.066)) but not when age was taken into account as an interaction term. This comprehensive study confirmed international findings associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Whilst clinical indications for ICU admission and overall mortality may differ in hospitalised patients, the main drivers of mortality are age, underlying conditions and disease severity, irrespective of location.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of redox homeostasis and ferroptosis have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung injury. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) are key regulators in this process. However, the clinical significance of ferroptotic factors in severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still lacking. This study investigated the prognostic value of serum glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the GSH/GSSG ratio in severe CAP. A prospective cohort of 267 ICU-admitted severe CAP patients (2021-2023) was analyzed. Serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG were measured within 24 h of admission. Patients were grouped by 30-day survival. Statistical analyses included comparative tests, Spearman correlation, ROC curves, Kaplan-Meier survival, and multivariate logistic regression. Among 267 patients, 79 (29.6%) died within 90 days. Deceased patients had significantly lower GPX4 and GSH/GSSG (both P < 0.001). GPX4 was lower in COVID-19 cases (P = 0.022), while GSH/GSSG showed no such difference. GPX4 and GSH/GSSG were moderately correlated (r = 0.301, P < 0.001). ROC analysis showed good predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, with an AUC of 0.778 for GPX4, 0.780 for GSH/GSSG, and 0.841 for their combination. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated lower survival with reduced GPX4 or GSH/GSSG (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified lower GPX4, GSH/GSSG, COVID-19, higher SOFA scores, prolonged ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation as independent mortality risk factors. Lower serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG ratios are associated with increased mortality in severe CAP.",

Coinfection is not well documented, and within available reports, mild hepatic injury has been demonstrated. A 25-year-old man with no significant past medical history acquired coinfection and developed transaminitis, moderate hyperbilirubinemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. The degree of transaminitis was severe and out of proportion for either SARS-CoV-2 or EBV infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further laboratory and imaging studies to rule out other etiologies. He was managed symptomatically and without antiviral medications. The patient's transaminase levels demonstrated a pattern of recovery on day 10 with complete normalization documented at 10 months. There were no long-term sequelae. While SARS-CoV-2 and EBV are each independently associated with mild hepatic injury, this case highlights a rare presentation of severe liver injury, possibly due to synergistic viral effects.",

    "abstract": "The burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection in adults is of interest in the context of recently-licensed vaccines. However, burden estimates are affected by test error associated with the testing platform, and number and type of samples tested. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults with acute lower respiratory tract disease (aLRTD) hospitalised in Bristol, UK, from April 2022-March 2023. RSV was detected by RT-PCR both by routine standard-of-care (SOC) testing, and by testing of additional nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva and sputum samples from a patient subset. Latent class analysis was used to quantify and adjust for test error rates, including effects of multiple testing. RSV test-positivity rates are reported, and after adjustment for test error, are used to calculate adult population incidence/1000 person-years. 6906/11445 aLRTD cases (60%) were tested and 251 were positive (3.6%; 251/6906). Test-positivity peaked in December (95%CI 7.9-12.7%). Among cases, 43% had pneumonia, 55% had non-pneumonic infection, 59% chronic respiratory disease exacerbations, and 16% heart failure. Test-positivity was highest in 75-84-year-olds, and 30-day mortality was highest in ≥ 75-year-olds (7.1%; 9/127). Due to low positivity-rates and imperfect specificity (0.98-1.00), test-positivity (3.6%) overestimated inferred true prevalence (2.3%). After adjustment for test error, we estimate overall adult population incidence/1000-person-years to be 0.33 (0.21-0.49), and 2.02 (1.10-3.06) in ≥ 75-year-olds. RSV contributes significantly to hospitalised adult aLRTD, particularly among the elderly. The implementation of effective RSV vaccines could reduce morbidity, mortality and associated costs of disease. Adult RSV burden accuracy is improved by adjustment for test characteristics due to the impact of imperfect specificity when positivity-rates are low, and this is particularly important for out-of-season estimates. Multiple samples can improve burden estimation accuracy only when tests have near-perfect specificity.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza among young children in LMICs is crucial to inform implementation policies, given the importance of maternal influenza and RSV vaccination, which may not yet be widely available. This study established a one-year surveillance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) from June 2022-2023 in hospitalized children 1-24 months from rural West Bengal India. We tested nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children admitted with SARI using multiplex real-time PCR for influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, with a subset (N = 81) tested for additional respiratory pathogens and analyzed clinical features, factors influencing infections, and hospitalization duration. Of 1842 children admitted with SARI, 77% (1419) were between 1 and 24 months. Of 191 sampled, 21 required intensive care, and 3 died. The majority of mothers (83.7%) were vaccinated against COVID-19, but none against influenza, pertussis, or RSV. Viruses were detected in 44% (84/191), with RSV being the most common 60/190 (31.6%), followed by influenza 12/190 (6.3%), and SARS-CoV-2 2/191 (1%). Influenza subtypes included influenza A/H3 (6/16), A/H1N1pdm (5/16), Influenza B (4/16), and Influenza C (1/16). RSV peaked during autumn, influenza during winter and monsoon. Influenza was more common in infants < 6 months (13.4%, p = 0.03). RSV affected both infants under 6 months and over similarly (34% vs. 29.6%, p = 0.5). Infants < 6 months frequently required oxygen support (p = 0.02), though ICU admissions were similar (p = 0.98). RSV was associated with 19% of ICU admissions and influenza with 14%. Additional pathogens included Haemophilus influenzae (23.45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), rhinovirus (13.6%), parainfluenza virus group (6.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5%), bocavirus (3.7%), adenovirus (3.7%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (1%), and Bordetella (1%). Viral-bacterial co-detection occurred in 34%, especially in infants < 6 months. Children with RSV had increased risk of having S. pneumoniae [Odds Ratio OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.8-21.3]. Rhinovirus cases were associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and longer length of stay, regardless of age. RSV and influenza were the key contributors to SARI in children under-2. Findings highlight the need for diagnostics to guide vaccination, reduce antibiotic use, and improve indoor air quality for alleviating the SARI burden in rural settings.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 and long COVID are characterized by a dysregulated immune response. However, the role of macrophages during viral infection is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in increased macrophage numbers and extensive formation of enlarged lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells using humanized mice, rhesus macaques and post-mortem human lung tissue. Notably, infection by other coronaviruses tested, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and two bat coronaviruses (SHC014-CoV or WIV1-CoV), did not result in macrophage proliferation or foam cell formation. Foam cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung tissue display a pro-fibrotic and pro-thrombotic phenotype as they are enriched for genes associated with platelet activation and aggregation, as well as extracellular matrix organization and collagen synthesis. After viral clearance, macrophage numbers remain elevated, and lung fibrosis and thrombi persist. Importantly, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment with a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, EIDD-2801, prevents increases in macrophage cell numbers and foam cell formation, and reduces fibrosis markers. These observations highlight the contribution of macrophages to lung inflammation and tissue injury leading to the pulmonary fibrosis observed in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has directly, and indirectly, exacerbated existing social health inequalities. People living in socially deprived areas are at greater risk of most adverse outcomes from COVID-19. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of social inequalities in COVID-19 related YLL (Years of Life Lost) in metropolitan France during 2020. The French national mortality database was used to identify COVID-19 related deaths. The French deprivation (FDep) index was used to assign deaths to a municipality-based social deprivation quintile of the French metropolitan population. Residual life expectancy at age of death was defined using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 reference aspirational life table, and YLL was estimated for each registered death. Health inequalities were measured using gap measures between least and most deprived areas (absolute and relative), distributional measures (slope index of inequality (SII), relative index of inequality (RII)) and measure of potential impact (population attributable fraction (PAF)). The PAF was estimated using the least socially deprived quintile (Q1) as the reference level. In 2020, the overall age standardized YLL rate related to COVID-19 per 100 000 population was 836, ranging from 831 in the least deprived quintile (Q1) to 1058 in the most deprived quintile (Q5), reflecting the non-linear distribution between deprivation quintiles and COVID-19 YLL. The absolute gap was 227 and relative range was 1.27. The SII was 234.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 226.6-241.9] COVID-19 YLL age standardized per 100 000 population. The rate in the most deprived areas (Q5) was around 67% higher than the mean population rate (RII = 1.33). The PAF estimate was not consistent (PAF = 0.36%) with gap and distributional measures of inequality. COVID-19 cause-specific mortality was unequally socially distributed across areas. Our analysis highlighted marked inequalities in YLL estimates across urban and rural municipalities of France, the more disadvantaged a municipality, the higher YLL it has. Further research is needed to better investigate the mechanisms driving such inequalities, particularly regarding the wider role of social determinants of health, which has strong impact on the excess mortality risks.",

    "title": "Inflammatory cytokine-primed MSC-derived extracellular vesicles ameliorate acute lung injury via enhanced immunomodulation and alveolar repair.",
    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by excessive inflammation and alveolar damage, arising from pathogens or systemic insults such as sepsis, and can progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite its severity, effective pharmacological treatments remain unavailable, and current clinical interventions are limited to supportive care such as mechanical ventilation. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have emerged as promising candidates for lung repair, but insufficient immunosuppressive capacity often limits their efficacy. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) were primed with IFN-γ and TNF-α to enhance the immunomodulatory properties of their secreted EVs. We characterized unprimed control MSC-EVs (C-MEVs) and primed MSC-EVs (P-MEVs) by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blotting for EV markers. Functional assays in THP-1 and A549 cells examined anti-inflammatory potency and barrier regeneration against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage. A preclinical mouse model of LPS-induced ALI was used to evaluate inflammatory cytokine expression, immune cell infiltration, pulmonary edema, and vascular leakage. Finally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected Vero E6 cells were tested whether P-MEVs could mitigate the inflammatory damage characteristic of virus-triggered acute lung injury. Primed hADMSCs exhibited elevated expression of immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., COX-2, IDO, TSG-6), without changing EV morphology or yield. P-MEVs mitigated LPS-induced inflammation more effectively than C-MEVs in THP-1 and A549 cells. In vivo, P-MEVs more robustly attenuated inflammatory cytokines, immune cell recruitment, and lung injury markers in mice challenged with LPS. In SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, P-MEVs suppressed cytopathic effects and inflammatory responses more potently than C-MEVs. Mechanistic analyses revealed that these enhancements were associated with elevated miRNA levels, including miR-221-3p, involved in inhibiting inflammatory pathways. Inflammatory cytokine priming substantially augments the immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative efficacy of hADMSC-derived EVs, offering superior therapeutic effects in ALI models and promising activity against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of P-MEVs as an innovative, cell-free platform for treating severe pulmonary disorders, including ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Although messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have been employed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, they are still limited by instability and low translation capacity. Alterations in tRNA abundance and modification, linking codon optimality, impact mRNA stability and protein output in a codon-dependent manner, suggesting tRNA as a potential translation enhancer. Here, we report a strategy named tRNA-plus to augment translation via artificially modulating tRNA availability. Overexpression of specific tRNAs enhances the stability and translation efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA, boosting protein levels up to 4.7-fold. Additionally, chemically synthesized tRNAs bearing multiple site-specific modifications, particularly at the anticodon-loop and TΨC-loop, exhibit on average ~4-fold higher decoding efficacy than unmodified tRNAs, along with increased stability and reduced immunotoxicity. Furthermore, codelivery of Spike mRNA vaccine and tRNA through lipid nanoparticles elicits augmented humoral and cellular immune responses in vivo. These results presented here provide a general approach to elevate mRNA translation potency, with applications in diverse translation-based fields.",

In the presence of an external rotating magnetic field, the developed AR are capable of moving controllably and wirelessly, and efficiently scavenging inflammatory factors and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus due to the existing receptors from the cell membrane cloaking strategy, thereby inhibiting the virus invasion and reducing the damage of inflammation to the lungs. Due to the active movement, AR significantly increase and prolong the accumulation of Cur in the lungs in vivo, thus alleviating the pneumonia and regulating pneumonia microenvironment. The designed hybrid microrobot system, with magnetic actuation and active neutralization of inflammatory factors and virus, shows great promise as a potential platform for pneumonia therapy.",

    "abstract": "This study explored drug repurposing strategies against conserved RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to address viral mutation challenges. Conserved RNA elements were computationally identified by aligning 283 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Korean patients. RNA secondary structures were predicted using RNAfold and RNAstructure, followed by virtual screening of 11 compounds using the RNALigands database (binding energy threshold: -6.0 kcal/mol). The antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of riboflavin were experimentally validated in vitro using Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01). Riboflavin exhibited selective antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 59.41 µM), showing no cytotoxicity at concentrations < 100 µM. Riboflavin treatment during viral inoculation significantly reduced viral replication, whereas riboflavin treatment pre- or post-inoculation had no effect. The other screened compounds lacked antiviral efficacy. In terms of antiviral activity, riboflavin was less potent than remdesivir (IC50 = 25.81 µM). Riboflavin is a potential RNA-targeted therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2. This study established a framework for integrating computational and experimental methods to identify conserved RNA targets, thus offering a strategy applicable to other RNA viruses. This result indicates the potential of riboflavin as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the importance of considering nutritional factors in the context of viral infections.",

Participants also watched videos on screening methods and shared their views. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated to English, and thematically analyzed using Dedoose 9.0.46. Three main themes emerged: (1) barriers to prevention included low knowledge, logistical and psychological challenges, and issues related to healthcare providers; (2) participants viewed HPV self-sampling positively, although concerns about incorrect self-sampling and mailing logistics were noted; (3) participants generally accepted cervical cancer prevention and drew parallels to COVID-19 prevention, suggesting similar public health approaches. These findings suggest that combining HPV self-sampling with strategies used for COVID-19 prevention, including public education, government support, and improved access, could enhance cervical cancer prevention in Southern Vietnam.",

To conduct a global survey of hospital leaders' views on FCC culture, policies, and practices in health care organizations serving children, including in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. A cross-sectional electronic survey. Surveys were received from 256 leaders from 215 hospitals in 38 countries. Preliminary psychometric analysis yielded a 44-item instrument wherein a higher total score indicated leaders had more positive views of their hospital's FCC. A majority reported high levels of FCC culture at bedside and supportive policies for family presence and participation. Fewer leaders reported family partnership at the organizational level, health professional education on FCC, or organizational accountability for FCC. In multivariable analyses, having an active patient and family advisory council (PFAC) was associated with higher FCC scores. Free-text comments reflected respondents' commitment to family presence and participation in care and decision-making, factors that facilitated or impeded active PFACs, variability in FCC practices, and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on FCC. These findings suggest a commitment to FCC by leaders in hospitals providing pediatric care globally, and that an active PFAC is associated with higher ratings of hospital FCC culture, policies, and practices. Expanded adoption of PFACs, along with standardized measurement and quality improvement monitoring, may improve the family-centeredness of pediatric health care, and thereby contribute to quality and safety.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of burnout and associated mental health problems, including depression and stress, among ICU physicians and nurses following the pandemic, and to explore the factors contributing to burnout. A cross-sectional design was used in this study. This study was conducted in ICUs across hospitals in three distinct regions of China in 2023. This study included 1488 ICU physicians and nurses, recruited through convenience sampling. Primary outcomes of this study were to investigate the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among ICU physicians and nurses, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey. As secondary outcomes, we aimed to explore mental health issues, including depression, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, and stress levels, measured by Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. A total of 1447 participants were included in the study. Among them, 676 (46.7%) were physicians and 771 (53.3%) were nurses. 333 (49.3%) physicians and 458 (59.4%) nurses were found to have overall high burnout. 162 (24.0%) physicians and 247 (32.0%) nurses reported experiencing major depression, while 603 (89.2%) physicians and 601 (78.0%) nurses reported high levels of perceived stress. ICU physicians who were married (OR=0.607, 95% CI=0.392 to 0.940) had a lower risk of burnout, while those maintaining a neutral attitude to work-life balance (OR=1.621, 95% CI=1.022 to 2.571) might experience high burnout. Female ICU nurses (OR=0.698, 95% CI=0.500 to 0.974) who actively participated in epidemic prevention (OR=0.547, 95% CI=0.344 to 0.868) exhibited a reduced likelihood of suffering burnout. Higher burnout risks in ICU nurses were associated with working in teaching hospitals (OR=1.672, 95% CI=1.113 to 2.510) and a longer length of ICU stay for patients (OR=1.789, 95% CI=1.173 to 2.730). ICU physicians and nurses in China are encountering significant burnout and mental health challenges following the pandemic. Possible risk factors for burnout encompass various dimensions, including individual, occupational and organisational levels. There is an urgent need to implement effective interventions to mitigate burnout, promote mental health and enhance the overall well-being of these healthcare professionals.",

Patients in the process of orthodontic treatment, able to read Mandarin online, provided informed consent for the use of the data recorded and completed the questionnaire within a reasonable time. None. The demographic information and orthodontic urgencies were collected using online questionnaires. The peritraumatic distress symptoms were assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain was evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale. A total of 480 participants were enrolled, including 331 with fixed appliances, 131 with clear aligners and 18 with removable appliances. For all participants, the median CPDI score was 12 (4, 19). Higher CPDI scores were observed in participants with urgency (14 (6, 21) vs 8 (2, 15), p<0.001), participants aged ≥18 years (15 (6, 23) vs 8 (2, 15), p<0.001) and participants with TMJ pain (15 (8, 24) vs 11 (3, 18), p<0.001). Linear regression showed that age >18 years (β=0.271, p<0.001), TMJ pain (β=0.169, p<0.001) and urgency (β=0.144, p=0.001) were independently associated with the mean CPDI score. The study suggested that during catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 lockdown, orthodontic urgencies may exacerbate patients' peritraumatic distress, especially among adult patients and those who suffer from TMJ pain.",

    "abstract": "Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) imaging remains the gold standard for assessing myocardial fibrosis and scarring, with left ventricular (LV) LGE presence and extent serving as a predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Despite its clinical significance, LGE-based LV scar quantification is not used routinely due to the labor-intensive manual segmentation and substantial inter-observer variability. We developed ScarNet that synergistically combines a transformer-based encoder in Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM), which we fine-tuned with our dataset, and a convolution-based decoder in U-Net with tailored attention blocks to automatically segment myocardial scar boundaries while maintaining anatomical context. This network was trained and fine-tuned on an existing database of 401 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients (4,137 2D LGE images) with expert segmentation of myocardial and scar boundaries in LGE images, validated on 100 patients (1,034 2D LGE images) during training, and tested on unseen set of 184 patients (1,895 2D LGE images). Ablation studies were conducted to validate each architectural component's contribution. In 184 independent testing patients, ScarNet achieved accurate scar boundary segmentation (median DICE=0.912 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.863-0.944], concordance correlation coefficient [CCC]=0.963), significantly outperforming both MedSAM (median DICE=0.046 [IQR: 0.043-0.047], CCC=0.018) and nnU-Net (median DICE=0.638 [IQR: 0.604-0.661], CCC=0.734). For scar volume quantification, ScarNet demonstrated excellent agreement with manual analysis (CCC=0.995, percent bias=-0.63%, CoV=4.3%) compared to MedSAM (CCC=0.002, percent bias=-13.31%, CoV=130.3%) and nnU-Net (CCC=0.910, percent bias=-2.46%, CoV=20.3%). Similar trends were observed in the Monte Carlo simulations with noise perturbations. The overall accuracy was highest for SCARNet (sensitivity=95.3%; specificity=92.3%), followed by nnU-Net (sensitivity=74.9%; specificity=69.2%) and MedSAM (sensitivity=15.2%; specificity=92.3%). ScarNet outperformed MedSAM and nnU-Net for predicting myocardial and scar boundaries in LGE images of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that ScarNet is less sensitive to noise perturbations than other tested networks.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted parents' mental health globally, yet few studies have examined long-term patterns in parents' mental health since the pandemic, and most lack pre-pandemic comparison data. This study addresses these gaps by examining mental distress and subjective wellbeing in Australian parents across four pandemic years, and relative to pre-pandemic. Parents were adults living with children (N = 3403) from a repeated national cross-sectional survey, representative of Australian parents in age, gender, partner status and geographical location. Patterns of mental health were estimated by regressing mental distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress) and subjective wellbeing (i.e., Life Satisfaction, Personal Wellbeing Index, and satisfaction with seven life domains) onto survey year (pre-pandemic: 2013, pandemic: 2020-2023). Parents' depression, anxiety and stress levels were consistently above pre-pandemic levels during the four years, with anxiety and depression levels being 32 % and 35 % higher than pre-pandemic in 2023, respectively. This coincided with a substantial drop in life satisfaction to below-normative levels in 2023. While satisfaction with personal safety was above pre-pandemic levels during 2021-23, satisfaction with health, standard of living, and future security was lower in 2022-23 compared to first two years. These effects were more pronounced and sustained for mothers, particularly on anxiety, stress and satisfaction with health. Four years into the pandemic, many Australian parents faced challenges with chronic mental health issues. Access to wholistic mental health services, along with financial supports for struggling families, are essential to supporting parental mental health in the aftermath of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Youth mental health was declining before the COVID-19 pandemic and worsened during the pandemic, yet less is known for the post-pandemic period. We examined parents' reports of youth mental health between 2022-2024. We administered serial cross-sectional surveys to four independent samples of Illinois parents in 6/2022, 5/2023, 10/2023, 3/2024, in English and Spanish, through the QualtricsXM panel (convenience sample of adults who agree to take surveys). Parents read a list of 14 youth mental health symptoms and indicated, for one randomly selected 2-17 year-old child, if the child experienced each symptom less often, the same amount, or more often than a year ago; or never. Parents indicated their own stress levels. At each timepoint, symptoms of irritability were most commonly reported, with different expression across developmental periods: tantrums in early childhood; easy frustration in school-age children. Approximately half of parents reported their child experienced >=1 mental health symptom more often at each timepoint (6/2022: 49.7%, 5/2023: 51.6%, 10/2023: 53.9%, 3/2024: 48.7%). Multivariable logistic regressions indicated parent stress was associated with higher odds of the child having >=1 mental health symptom more often (6/2022 aOR:3.37, 5/2023 aOR:2.07, 10/2023 aOR:1.76, 3/2024 aOR:3.31). At four survey timepoints over two years, approximately half of 2-17 year-old youth experienced mental health symptoms more often than they had before. This was most evident via transdiagnostic irritability symptoms. Screening for mental health, beginning in toddlerhood, and preventive interventions for parents and youth are potential mechanisms to mitigate the youth mental health crisis. not applicable.",

Here, we analysed epidemiological data on indigenous P. vivax cases from the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific regions in recent years. Significant upsurges are observed in more than half of the countries within these regions. In Papua New Guinea and Yemen, the increase has been consistent since 2015, while others, including Indonesia and Pakistan, have experienced sharp rises between 2020 and 2023 (e.g., +100% and +83.4%). Notably, in countries like Thailand, initially targeted by the WHO E-2025 elimination initiative, achieving elimination by 2025 appears unlikely. Factors like COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, and, more recently, climate change, do not fully resolve the reasons for resurgence in countries like Indonesia, where additional issues such as chloroquine resistance must also be addressed. We recommend that a compartmentalized approach is essential to effectively tackle the P. vivax resurgence and achieve meaningful progress.",

    "abstract": "We studied individuals who remained uninfected by SARS-CoV-2 despite repeated exposures during a May-July 2020 dormitory outbreak in Singapore. We compared immune profiles of those with exposed seronegative (ESN) (negative PCR and serology), with non-infected and infected groups. Following the lifting of quarantine, incident infection rates were compared between the ESN and non-infected cohorts. The immune profiles of 135 men with ESN (repeated negative PCR and persistent seronegativity), and 98 non-infected men, and 139 infected men were examined (mean age 33 years). Men with ESN exhibited higher percentages of CD4+ T-cells and classical monocytes, alongside increased specific CD4+ T cell responses to the non-structural protein 12-3 region (NSP12-3) and spike peptides of SARS-CoV-2, compared with non-infection controls. Those with ESN did not differ in their IgG levels against endemic human coronaviruses compared with non-infection controls. Men in the ESN group were found to be less likely to become infected compared with non-infected controls (21% vs. 39%, hazard ratio 0.47 [95% CI 0.27-0.73]) after the lifting of quarantine measures. These findings highlight the possible importance of cellular immunity in conferring partial resistance to infection and support the development of T-cell-focused strategies for high-risk settings.

    "abstract": "Trust is a key component of vaccine demand, yet there is a lack of consensus on how to define trust alongside a lack of actionable, contextually grounded measurement tools validated in low-income and middle-income countries. This study aimed to develop and validate a contextually relevant trust framework and measurement tool, that can lever trust to drive resilient demand. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted. Ethnographic research in Nigeria, Kenya, and Pakistan was undertaken to define trust in the context of childhood, human papillomavirus, and COVID-19 vaccines. The generated Vaccine Trust Framework was validated by fielding a nationally representative survey containing the constructed trust measurement tool to caregivers of adolescents in Kenya and Pakistan. Psychometric properties of the survey and associations between trust and vaccination behaviours were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression. The Vaccine Trust Framework, established through synthesis of ethnographic research, contains four interlinked domains-health system promise, health system delivery, vaccine promise, and vaccine delivery-and 15 measurable dimensions. Survey data were collected from 3670 participants in Kenya and 3734 in Pakistan. Trust was observed to influence vaccine behaviour and intentions, which was further supported by associations between quantitative trust scores and vaccination status across the studied vaccines. Regional trust variation was observed within Kenya and Pakistan, with patterns matching qualitative findings on the perceptions of local vaccine and health systems. The Vaccine Trust Framework provides a validated, contextually grounded tool for assessing trust in health systems and vaccines in low-income and middle-income countries. The Vaccine Trust Framework can be used as a prognostic tool, intervention design aid, or trust measurement tool within an intervention or monitoring study. Further research is in progress to assess its utility in designing and measuring the effect of trust-building interventions. Gates Foundation.

Despite guidelines recommending clinicians signpost individuals to them, their usage and impact have never been reported. We aimed to quantify demand for, and the nature of, contacts to a UK epilepsy helpline; assess reach and equity of access; and explore whether data on the issues people raised might serve as an indicator of changing community needs. Retrospective analysis of anonymized records from contacts to Epilepsy Action's helpline between October 2020 and September 2024. Descriptive statistics and incidence rate calculations were used to assess contact characteristics, geographic and socioeconomic distribution, and the topic codes assigned to contacts by trained advisors. Helpline received 32,964 contacts from 25,316 individuals-mainly people with epilepsy (69.7 %) and family/friends (24.6 %). Use increased by 40 % over the period, exceeding population growth, with 11.43 contacts per 1000 prevalent cases in 2020/21 and 16.03 in 2023/24. Contacts came from across the UK, but fewer originated from more deprived areas than expected. Users sought support on a wide range of medical, emotional, and practical issues, with increasing contact complexity over time. Topics varied by deprivation level. Shifts over time in issues raised aligned with real-world events (e.g., COVID-19, medication shortages). This first systematic examination of a third-sector epilepsy helpline reveals high and growing demand, broad reach, and access inequities. Routine helpline data may offer a novel, real-time lens on community needs. Our analytic method could support evaluations of other helplines.",

    "abstract": "As part of its COVID-19 pandemic response, in April 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded 26 university-based Prevention Research Centers (PRCs) with a one-year award to raise vaccine confidence, demand, and uptake in diverse communities. The PRCs formed the Vaccine Confidence Network (VCN) to share information, resources, and strategies, and to collaborate. To support the VCN, CDC organized and facilitated numerous network activities, including hosting 14 virtual network meetings, a Slack channel, a resource library, and 4 office hours, disseminating 52 editions of a newsletter, and responding to 172 technical assistance requests from PRCs. These efforts aimed to increase meaningful and impactful collaborations over time so that PRCs' work benefited from their engagement in the VCN. We evaluated the VCN using two network surveys, an interim one at 6 months and a final one at 16 months, with 26 key informant interviews conducted during interim reporting to guide final survey tool development. The interim survey asked PRCs to report on the levels of collaboration and impact in their PRC-PRC relationships. The final survey repeated the interim survey's measurement and asked PRCs about the types of collaborations they engaged in with other PRCs, the types of impacts those collaborations had on their work, and how the collaborations came about (their origins). The number of reported undirected connections between the 26 PRCs grew by 72 %, from 53 to 91 between interim and final measurements. The self-reported amounts of collaboration and impact increased over time. The most common type of collaboration was exchange of information, tools, and resources (in 64/91, 70 % of undirected connections). While the most common type of impact was improved design (in 57/118, 48 % of directed connections). Of collaborations whose origins PRCs reported, 86 % (67/78) first connected during a VCN network activity, like chatting in a meeting or in Slack. The VCN example (i.e., its network practices and evaluation) could be useful to funders and self-organizing networks that are looking to enact coordinated responses to emergency and non-emergency public health and other issues.",

    "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM2.5) and allergens are common environmental exposures. However, their combined effects and their risks are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of co-exposure to house dust mites (HDM) allergens and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on lung immune responses, and assess the susceptibility to viral protein. We found that compared with HDM alone, mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP showed DEP-phagocytosed macrophages in lungs and did not show asthma phenotypes, including T helper 2 (Th2) response, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Mechanistically, DEP induced an immunosuppressive state by suppressing HDM-induced Th2 responses by reducing FcγRIIB and FcγRIII-mediated phagocytosis and antigen presentation in the lungs. Notably, short-term exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1) in altered immune environment led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This was accompanied by elevated transforming growth factor-β1 expression, increased total IgE levels, and eosinophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings suggest that co-exposure to PM2.5 and allergens causes a vulnerable lung environment that enhances susceptibility to virus-induced lung diseases. Our study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive environmental health assessments that account for the combined risks of PM2.5, allergens, and viral exposures.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have long-term deleterious effects on the central nervous system and even contribute to post-COVID neurological syndromes. Interestingly, inflammation-induced proteolytic processing of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the generation of peptides capable of aggregating into amyloid fibrils in vitro. Herein, we investigate the in vitro effect of a fibrillogenic fragment of the Spike protein [Spike 194-203 (S194)] on the aggregation and toxicity of the Parkinson's disease (PD) protein α-synuclein (αSyn). Our results indicate that S194 fibrils stimulate in a concentration-dependent manner the fibrillation of αSyn monomer, resulting in aggregates with increased capacity of inducing lipid vesicle leakage and toxicity to neuroblastoma cells, in comparison with either αSyn or S194 alone. Bidimensional NMR (1H-15N-HSQC) suggests that S194 fibrils cause a higher perturbation in both the N-terminal region (sequence: 19-68) and the hydrophobic central domain of the αSyn monomer (sequence: 71-95), which is corroborated by protein-peptide docking and molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast with fibrils from wild-type αSyn, aggregates from the PD variant A30P exhibited a remarkable accelerative effect on S194 fibrillation. Similarly, fibrils from amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to Alzheimer's disease, exhibited a pro-aggregating effect on the S194 monomer. Taken together, these findings might contribute to a broader understanding of the potential connections between SARS-CoV-2 infection and amyloid-related neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting areas that may warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Medical resource allocation is important to ensure availability of care, especially in challenging circumstances like a pandemic. In fields of unpredictable care demand such as obstetrics, forecasting may help manage scarce resources. The development, validation, and implementation of a regional birth forecasting tool to support obstetrical staff planning in the Utrecht region during the COVID-19 pandemic. We combined predicted birth dates retrieved from Saltro, a large regional primary care laboratory, with data from the Dutch national perinatal registry (Perined) and Statistics Netherlands for model development. We created and implemented an HTML tool visualizing these forecasts, which were discussed during the regional acute obstetric health care network meetings. Six months after implementation, we assessed the impact of the tool using an evaluative stakeholder meeting. We achieved a performance accuracy (R) of 0.45, 0.61, and 0.67 (all actual number of births within 95% CI) forecasting the number of births in the region, pooled in 1-, 2-, and 3-weekly bins, respectively. After presenting these findings to stakeholders, we implemented a forecasting tool using the 2-week bin model. The evaluative stakeholder meeting proved that the tool improved communication, awareness of health care need, and collaborations among health care providers in the Utrecht region. Additionally, stakeholders identified additional applications, such as communication with patients and training of obstetric health care providers. Implementation of a forecasting tool for the number of births based on available data across the health care system added value to obstetrical care by providing insight into care demand, and increasing communication, awareness, and collaboration between health care providers. Further research should aim at improving regional obstetric acute care by fostering data sharing in order to improve health care demand forecasts.",

    "abstract": "The post-COVID-19 era in Pakistan is marked by economic turbulence and political instability. These circumstances have significantly disrupted the supply chains of numerous industries, including healthcare. The aim of this study is to explore the supply chain risk factors faced by hospitals in the post-COVID-19 era. A Qualitative inductive approach was adopted for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 supply chain professionals working at various Pakistani hospitals. Thematic analysis was carried out, generating six main themes that impact the supply chain of the hospitals: (1) organizational risks, (2) political and regulatory risks, (3) external risks, (4) financial risks, (5) supplier risks and (6) demand risks. Organizational risks, including employees' resistance to change and staff turnover, highlight the critical need for robust human resource strategies. Hospitals are particularly vulnerable to uncertain governance and economic policies, which are reflected in political and regulatory disruptions that are made worse by import bans, delays in customs clearance, strikes and communication blackouts. External risks such as counterfeit medicines, compromise patient safety and treatment outcomes. Financial risks, such as dollar rate fluctuations and tax revisions and Supplier-related risks, such as single-source supplier monopoly, further enhance the vulnerability of the supply chain. The article fills the gap in the literature by adopting a qualitative approach, offering an in-depth understanding of risk factors impacting the supply chain of Pakistani hospitals. The study highlights that with the changing economic and political scenario, new risks have emerged, including political, regulatory and financial challenges, which have been largely overlooked in the previous studies. This study enriches our understanding by exploring these factors in the post-pandemic era, particularly in the context of a developing country like Pakistan.",

    "abstract": "The ABO blood group system is associated with differential susceptibility to thrombotic vascular diseases. ABO is also known to be a strong trans-protein quantitative trait locus for plasma proteins involved in cell adhesion and hemostasis. To further investigate these associations, we integrated epigenomic, genomic, and proteomic data from the Milieu Intérieur cohort. We used the rs8176719 SNP to classify donors as either type O or non-O, and used linear models to compare levels of 229 plasma proteins in 400 donors, including age, sex, cytomegalovirus serostatus, and secretor status as covariates. We observed increased levels of soluble E-selectin and decreased levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) in O donors compared with non-O donors. By performing an epigenome-wide association study, we identified 23 differentially methylated CpG sites between blood types, which were all located in the ABO gene. Notably, CpG sites in the ABO promoter region of type O donors were less methylated than those of the non-O donors. Using mediation analysis, we found that these differences in DNA methylation partially explained the effects of blood group on differential E-selectin and vWF plasma levels. We find differentially methylated CpG sites between blood types and provide new evidence that ABO blood group status affects circulating levels of specific proteins.",

    "title": "Comorbidity patterns associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes: A cohort study based on the UK Biobank.",
    "abstract": "Pre-existing comorbidities are linked to increased risk of severe COVID-19, but comprehensive assessments of comorbidity patterns remain limited. We used network analysis to identify pre-existing comorbidity modules (i.e., groups of diseases more densely interconnected with each other than with other diseases in the comorbidity network) in a cohort of 420,920 individuals from the UK Biobank who were in England. We defined cases requiring hospitalization or who died of COVID-19 as \"severe COVID-19\". Logistic regression was used to examine associations between comorbidity modules and severe COVID-19, and a module-based comorbidity index was developed to predict severe COVID-19, compared with existing indices. Comorbidity network analysis identified 190 disease pairs with confirmed comorbidity associations, which were further divided into seven comorbidity modules. Among the 30,914 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, 3,970 were identified as severe cases (median age of 73.6 years, 58.77% being male). Six of seven identified modules showed statistically significant associations with severe COVID-19, especially modules related to circulatory and respiratory diseases (odds ratio = 1.67 [95% confidence interval 1.54-1.81]) and age-related eye diseases (1.39 [1.27-1.52]). Associations did not differ by sex, age or vaccination status but were generally stronger during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 31st January-1st October, 2020). Our newly developed module-based comorbidity index showed better performance in predicting severe COVID-19 (AUC = 0.779) compared to the existing Charlson Comorbidity Index (0.714) and the 16-comorbidity index (0.714). Our study demonstrated that pre-existing comorbidity modules, particularly modules related to circulatory and respiratory diseases and age-related eye diseases, were associated with severe COVID-19. Moreover, the module-based comorbidity index provides better prediction of severe COVID-19 than existing prediction indices.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic response demonstrated the effectiveness of adenovirus vector vaccines in inducing protective cellular and antibody responses. However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-⍺-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections, caused by various bacteria and viruses, pose a significant global health burden. In Lebanon, post-COVID-19 epidemiological data on respiratory infections remain scarce. To address this gap, this multicenter study investigates the epidemiology of community-acquired acute respiratory infections among children and adults in Tripoli, North Lebanon. From May 2023 to February 2024, nasopharyngeal samples were collected from outpatients with acute respiratory infections visiting hospitals and pediatric clinics in Tripoli. Samples were analyzed using BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2.1 Plus (bioMérieux, France), which targets 23 pathogens, including 19 viruses and four bacteria. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify the determinants of respiratory infections and examine associations between respiratory pathogens. Among 324 enrolled patients, 69.1% were co-infected with at least one pathogen. Human rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent (27.2%), followed by influenza A (19.8%), particularly influenza A/H1-2009 (16.4%), and RSV (11.4%). SARS-CoV-2 was still circulating with a prevalence of 6.8%. Classical human coronaviruses accounted for 6.1% of infections, with HCoV-NL63 (2.8%) being the most common. Parainfluenza viruses were identified in 5.2% of patients, with type 4 (2.5%) being the most prevalent, followed by type 3 (1.5%), type 1 (1.2%), and type 2 (0.3%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that human rhinovirus/enterovirus infection decreased the likelihood of influenza A (OR=0.25; 95%CI = 0.10-0.54; P = 0.001) or SARS-CoV-2 (OR=0.21; 95%CI = 0.03-0.75; P = 0.039) co-infection. Additionally, our logistic regression models identified significant associations between various determinants, symptoms, and common viruses, including a lower likelihood of influenza A (OR=0.23; 95%CI = 0.06-0.76; P = 0.019) and RSV (OR=0.29; 95%CI = 0.10-0.76; P = 0.017) infection among patients with higher educational levels. Notably, parainfluenza virus infections occurred significantly more in refugee patients (OR=7.22; 95%CI = 1.19-37.0; P = 0.020) compared to the host community. In conclusion, this study provides critical insights into the post-pandemic epidemiology of respiratory infections in Lebanon, informing clinicians, health authorities, and policymakers to optimize diagnostics, preventive measures, and antimicrobial stewardship strategies.",

This is a cross-sectional study with pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) between January 2016 and November 2021 in Brazil. Patients were divided into two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) for comparative analysis, and a predictive model was constructed to classify cases without a defined causative agent. Estimated number of COVID cases in obstetric patients with SARS and no defined agent. 38,774 pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with SARS were identified and categorized by date and causative agent. Women in the COVID-19 group (19.138) were older (29.86 ± 7.20 years), self-reported more frequently as non-white race (50.9%), and more often had educational status marked as blank or ignored (29.6% and 26.9%, respectively) compared to the Other confirmed agents' group (2.233). The groups differed in all presented variables, and patients in the COVID-19 group were diagnosed more often in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Using the XGBoost model, 13,978 cases of SARS with undefined etiology from 2020 and 2021 were reclassified: 13,799 (98.7%) as predicted COVID-19 and 179 (1.3%) as predicted non-COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the obstetric population were even higher than reported by authorities, indicating a significant impact on the maternal mortality ratio during this period.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of U.S. government stimulus payments on family health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that receiving stimulus checks is associated with better family health and the effect of stimulus check receipt differs by income level. Additionally, we hypothesized that spending on immediate needs and paying off loans is associated with worse family health, and the effects of this spending differ by income level. Participants included 456 registered Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) users, stratified by income, marital status, and parental status. We used the Family Health Scale - Long Form to measure family health constructs: social-emotional health, healthy lifestyle, health resources, and social support. For all statistical analyses, we used SAS Studio 3.8. We performed an exploratory factor analysis to determine six spending profiles: loans, savings, housing, household supplies, durable goods, and medical costs. After adjustment, our multiple linear regression model found that mean family health and social-emotional health scores were higher among individuals who received all three checks, but this did not differ by income category. Mean family health and social-emotional health were lower among individuals who spent more significant portions of their stimulus checks on housing, household supplies, and medical costs. Spending greater portions of checks on medical costs was associated with lower scores among every family health construct except family healthy lifestyle. Among mid-to-high-income participants, family health scores were significantly lower, with more spending on housing, household supplies, durable goods, and medical costs, with similar results in the subscale scores. The reduction of family health scores with spending on medical costs and durable goods were more pronounced among the mid-to-high-income group than the low-income group. Stimulus payments may be a promising family policy method for improving overall family health; however, more research should address the differences between income groups and government assistance.",

    "title": "The COVID-19 pandemic influence on fatal car crashes and impaired driving in Arkansas.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on motor vehicle traffic patterns, leading to a noticeable decrease in traffic volume during the peak of the pandemic. Previous studies have highlighted an increase in risky driving behaviors during the pandemic, such as impaired driving and not wearing seatbelts. Despite reduced traffic, many states, including Arkansas experienced an increase in motor vehicle crash fatality rates. This trend highlights the need to better understand the factors associated with this trend. This study aimed to examine the potential role of impaired driving and the lack of restraint use in the rise of fatal crashes during the pandemic. Record-level data from fatal car crashes occurring in Arkansas between 2018 through 2021 were obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare restraint use among both deceased drivers and passengers before (January 1, 2018 through March 10, 2020) and during the pandemic (March 11, 2020 through December 31, 2021), as well as impaired driving among drivers who died in a crash and all drivers involved in fatal crashes during the study period. During the study period, there were 1,226 deceased drivers, 369 deceased passengers, and 2,200 drivers involved in fatal crashes. Among the 1,226 deceased drivers, there was a 34% decrease in the odds of seatbelt use during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic (p = 0.001). There were no significant changes in impaired driving among deceased drivers during the pandemic (AOR: 1.24; p = 0.09).Seatbelt use among the 369 deceased passengers did not change (AOR: 0.99; p = 0.96).Among the 2,200 drivers involved in fatal crashes, there was a 31% decrease in the odds of seatbelt use (p < 0.0001) and a 38% increase in the odds of impaired driving (p = 0.0002) during the pandemic when compared to before the pandemic. The increase in fatal car crashes during the pandemic may be attributed to the increase in impaired driving and decrease in restraint use. These findings highlight the need for public health interventions, such as sobriety checkpoints, public awareness campaigns, and strengthened enforcement to address impaired driving and promote restraint use.",

In the United States, public health policy has led to a wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines that are usually freely available to everyone 6 months and older. However, several factors including misinformation create vaccine hesitancy and threaten to undercut the advances of the COVID-19 vaccination program. In this article, we take a network-based approach to investigate community acceptance of vaccines at the county level in the United States, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We use an exponential random graph model to discover important sociodemographic factors that influence the patterns of vaccination between counties and communities. In addition, we undertake an advanced topological data analysis (TDA) based network clustering method to discover more macrolevel communities that show common trends for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the United States. Our study uncovers that sociodemographic features, for example, higher education, household income, and US census regions have significant effects on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The cluster analysis demonstrates that different census regions as well as rural and urban areas have distinct preferences in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.",

Children under 18 years old admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University were collected due to testing positive for COVID-19 from the outbreak of COVID-19 to January 2023. Patient data, including age, vaccination history, admission symptoms, clinical progression, and treatment outcomes, were extracted from the database. From April 2020 to January 2023, 237 children under 18 years old with COVID-19-positive result in the pediatric ward were collected. All cases achieved hospital discharge without mortality. Among them, 17.72% were under 1 year old, 27.00% were 1-4 years old, 34.60% were 5-10 years old, and 20.68% were over 10 years old. Male predominance was observed (63.29%, sex ratio 1.72:1), the prevalence rate of children of all ages is also similar in sexual distinction (P = 0.739). Additionally, 53.16% of patients have mild symptoms; the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive children over 10 years old is higher than that of other age groups. The proportion of respiratory symptoms of children under 1 year old is significantly higher than other age groups (88.09%, P < 0.01). Convulsions manifested universally in 23 confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases (aged 2 months-11 years). Pediatric COVID-19 infections generally manifest mild symptoms; however, infants under 1 year old exhibit more severe respiratory symptoms, necessitating escalated ventilatory support. Additionally, male children demonstrate higher susceptibility to infection compared with females across all pediatric age groups, carrying clinical and public health implications for epidemic response. According to a review of 72,314 cases by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than 1% of the cases occurred in children under the age of 10 years, with the vast majority being children. If children are indeed infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the vast majority of people will have mild diseases that do not require hospitalization. Therefore, the available data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants are still limited. This article collects the cases of children who have been hospitalized because of positive tests since the outbreak of COVID-19, analyzes, and understands how COVID-19 influences children, which can help us better interpret and respond to public health measures.",

    "abstract": "Delirium remains frequently undetected by healthcare providers; partnering with family may be a novel way to identify and manage delirium. This study explores the feasibility of a family-administered intervention for delirium prevention, detection, and management. Pilot randomized controlled trial. Two Canadian ICUs. Patient-family pairs (dyads) were included. Eligible patients had no primary brain injury, a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of greater than or equal to -3, and were expected to remain in the ICU for at least 24 hours to complete all study assessments. Dyads were randomly assigned to either standard care (control) or the intervention, which included delirium education and family-administered checklists with prevention/management strategies and a detection tool (\"Sour Seven\"). Outcomes included feasibility indicators, enrollment and completion rates, and psychological outcomes (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Kessler Psychologic Distress (K-10) scales in the ICU and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Between January 2020 and June 2023, during the height of the COVID pandemic, 197 patient-family pairs were approached, with 64 (32%) consenting to participate; participation required both the patient and a family member. Despite recruitment challenges, 75% of families completed in-ICU questionnaires, and 38% completed all follow-ups. The family members in the intervention group demonstrated increased delirium knowledge compared with baseline delirium knowledge, and engagement in prevention strategies, with 8 of 19 (42%) family members identifying delirium using the Sour Seven. At the 3-month follow-up, seven family members showed significant anxiety, and five showed significant depression. Observations of ICU rounds revealed limited delirium discussions. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of family-administered delirium care in ICU settings. However, the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be overlooked. The study faced recruitment challenges and demonstrated the difficulties of family involvement in delirium care, particularly during restricted family presence. A full evaluation of effectiveness requires a hypothesis-testing trial with procedural adjustments to streamline data collection and strengthen family-care team partnerships.

This single-center study included 84 patients: 50 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-representative of fibrotic pattern-and 34 with cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD)-as an example of mostly inflammatory pattern. For a secondary objective, we analyzed 50 additional patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We performed semi-automatic segmentation of ILD regions using a deep learning model followed by manual review. From each segmented region, 103 radiomic features were extracted. Classification was performed using an XGBoost model with 1000 bootstrap repetitions and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to identify the most predictive features. The model accurately distinguished a fibrotic ILD pattern from an inflammatory ILD one, achieving an average test set accuracy of 0.91 and AUROC of 0.98. The classification was driven by radiomic features capturing differences in lung morphology, intensity distribution, and textural heterogeneity between the two disease patterns. In differentiating cellular NSIP from COVID-19, the model achieved an average accuracy of 0.89. Inflammatory ILDs exhibited more uniform imaging patterns compared to the greater variability typically observed in viral pneumonia. Radiomics combined with explainable AI offers promising diagnostic support in distinguishing fibrotic from inflammatory ILD patterns and differentiating inflammatory ILDs from viral pneumonias. This approach could enhance diagnostic precision and provide quantitative support for personalized ILD management.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted longstanding health inequities, particularly among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) communities, which experienced disproportionately high morbidity and mortality. This manuscript documents the implementation, adaptation, and lessons learned from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted during a rapidly evolving pandemic context. The RCT tested two public health interventions: (1) a motivational interviewing strategy to promote COVID-19 testing and preventive behaviors, and (2) a symptom monitoring tool to assess COVID-related symptoms. As the public health landscape shifted with the introduction of vaccines and evolving guidance, protocols required frequent adaptation to remain relevant. Four major amendments were made to adapt the study to evolving conditions, including changes to inclusion criteria, the addition of community-prioritized content such as vaccine hesitancy, and adjustments to accommodate mixed vaccination statuses within households. Delays in multiple IRB approvals often rendered changes outdated by the time they could be implemented. Recruitment was limited, and intervention delivery faced challenges including low survey completion and technological barriers. Nonetheless, strong collaboration with tribal partners and respect for tribal sovereignty enabled culturally grounded, community-responsive adaptations throughout the study. Lessons from the implementation process underscore the need for flexible, adaptive research approaches that maintain rigorous community and tribal oversight. Future research on urgent, ongoing health issues can be strengthened through streamlined regulatory pathways and sustained partnerships with AIAN communities in future emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most significant global health crises in recent years. This study aimed to assess the determinants of perceived financial threat of COVID-19 and its implications on household's economic stability in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 3058 households from the third round of the COVID-19 high-frequency phone survey of households (HFPS-HH) data, executed by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia in partnership with the World Bank. The data were extracted and managed using STATA version 17. A partial proportional odds model was applied to assess the significant predictors that affect the perceived financial threat of COVID-19. The analysis revealed that 79.9% of respondents (95% CI: 78.5-81.4%) experienced some level of financial threat from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of them (61.7%; 95% CI: 60.0-63.4%) perceiving it as a substantial financial threat. Key factors of financial threat included Age [AOR = 1.280, P = 0.008]; COVID-19 illness worry for substantial threat (AOR = 0.546, p < 0.001), for moderate threat (AOR = 0.562, P = 0.005)]; Ability to buy medicine for substantial threat [AOR = 0.546, p < 0.001], for moderate threat [AOR = 0.562, p = 0.005]; employed [AOR = 1.310, p = 0.014]; engagement in additional income activities for substantial threat [AOR = 3.428, p < 0.001], and for moderate threat [AOR = 3.043, P = 0.018]. The findings revealed that a significant proportion of respondents perceived COVID-19 as a financial threat, which adversely affected their economic stability. Vulnerability to financial threat was notably higher among older individuals, the unemployed, those unable to afford essential medicine, and respondents who expressed heightened concern about illness. In contrast, engagement in additional income-generating activities served as a protective factor. These results underscore the need for policymakers to prioritize inclusive social protection systems, expand access to affordable healthcare, promote employment opportunities, and facilitate income diversification. Such interventions are critical to enhancing household economic resilience and enabling a rapid response to future public health and economic crises. Additionally, future research should consider longitudinal designs to track changes in perceptions over time and incorporate broader economic indicators.",

    "abstract": "Background: The extension of Medicare telehealth waivers, following the COVID-19 public health emergency, presents an unprecedented opportunity to examine the longitudinal relationship between telehealth usage and cognitive functioning in later life. We analyzed transitions in telehealth use and investigated whether associations between telehealth use and cognitive functioning vary across different levels of cognitive performance. Methods: Using a longitudinal cohort design with data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (2021-2023), we examined patterns of telehealth access and use among Medicare beneficiaries aged 70+ (N = 3,116). Cognitive functioning was assessed using a comprehensive battery measuring memory, orientation, and executive function. We categorized telehealth access/use into four categories: (1) no access to internet-enabled devices, (2) basic use (email/texting only), (3) broader internet use without telehealth, and (4) telehealth use. Using unconditional quantile regression with fixed effects, we examined associations between telehealth access/use and cognitive functioning across the cognitive performance distribution. Results: While 64% of telehealth users maintained their usage over consecutive years, 44% of those without device access remained without access. Compared to basic internet use, lack of access to internet-enabled devices was associated with cognitive decline (b = -0.64, p < 0.05), whereas telehealth use was associated with better cognitive functioning (b = 0.57, p < 0.01). The association between telehealth use and cognitive functioning was only significant at the lower end of the cognitive distribution (10th percentile: b = 1.43, p < 0.01), with no significant associations observed at higher levels. Conclusions: The stable nature of digital access and usage over time-with most older adults either maintaining their initial level or showing limited upward mobility in digital engagement-underscores the importance of early intervention to promote internet access and skills. Telehealth use was linked to cognitive benefits only at the lower end of the distribution, suggesting the importance of targeted interventions to promote telehealth access among the older population at risk of cognitive impairment.",

Therefore, to recapitulate the native conformation of the HR2core peptide α-helix and the HR1core site conserved residues, we employed hydrocarbon double-stapling. The resulting all-hydrocarbon stapled peptide M2PA shows highly potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, as well as other betacoronaviruses tested. Also, M2PA is effective against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, and it possesses outstanding pharmacokinetic properties. This represents the first successful minimization of a pan-coronavirus inhibitor to an HR2core-based α-helical peptide, and as such, M2PA peptide stands as a promising candidate for drug development to combat coronavirus pandemics.",

A difference-in-differences approach assessed pandemic-related changes and disparities by race/ethnicity and insurance status. Results: During the pandemic, odds of emergency department visits involving alcohol use increased by 16% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.27) and cannabis use by 10% (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.01-1.20). Prepandemic, Native American individuals had markedly higher odds of opioid use, while African American individuals had higher odds of cannabis and nicotine use. Disparities in cannabis use narrowed for Hispanic and Native American individuals compared to White individuals. Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients showed consistently elevated odds for opioid, cannabis, and nicotine use. Conclusions: The pandemic was associated with increased alcohol and cannabis use in pregnancy and shifting disparities across racial and insurance groups. Targeted public health strategies are needed to address substance use among pregnant individuals, especially during societal disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a leading cause of paediatric respiratory infections, is a major contributor to global childhood morbidity. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and phylogenetic characterization of HRSV in paediatric severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Hangzhou. A total of 2,277 paediatric SARI samples were screened for HRSV. Epidemiological trends, including age-specific positivity rates, were analysed. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 113 HRSV-positive samples (subgroup A n=60, subgroup B n=53) to characterize genetic evolution. Phylogenetic analysis identified viral lineages and evolutionary rates. In silico binding free energy calculations assessed the impact of antigenic site mutations on monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding. In this study, disruptions in transmission patterns and age-specific positivity rates were observed in 2021 and 2023, coinciding with strict COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions. A novel A.D.3.X lineage, circulating during 2021-2023 and defined by five unique aa substitutions in the G gene, was identified. The emergence of this lineage may have contributed to the observed epidemiological disruptions. In silico binding free energy calculations predicted that antigenic site mutations (N276S and I206M) in local strains reduce binding affinities for mAbs motavizumab and nirsevimab. These results emphasize HRSV's genetic diversification in Eastern China and underscore the necessity for continuous genomic surveillance to track antigenic evolution and refine prevention strategies for high-risk paediatric populations.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 remains a potentially severe condition for immunocompromised individuals, such as patients with hematologic malignancy. These patients are at increased risk of progressing to severe-critical or prolonged COVID-19. Prompt treatment with antivirals has proven effective in preventing disease progression and is recommended by current guidelines. We discuss here the position of remdesivir in the management of onco-hematologic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and strategies for its use. Narrative review of current evidence regarding remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancy. Patients with non-severe COVID-19 should receive remdesivir as soon as possible after diagnosis, and within 7 days from symptom onset. A 3-day treatment duration is recommended. In patients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 - patients with B-cell depletion and recipients of allogeneic HSCT or CAR T cell therapy or bispecific antibodies - treatment may be prolonged and/or combined with other COVID-19 therapeutics. Patients with severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen should receive remdesivir as soon as possible, preferentially for 10 days. In those at high risk of progressing to critical COVID-19, combination of remdesivir with other COVID-19 therapeutics can be considered. In case of relapse or persisting symptoms, remdesivir treatment can be prolonged and/or repeated or combined with other COVID-19 therapeutics. Evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies shows that remdesivir is a valid option for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected onco-hematologic patients, across a wide spectrum of COVID-19 severity. The drawback of remdesivir-intravenous administration mode-is counterbalanced by good tolerability, negligible drug-drug interactions and a high barrier to virus resistance.",

    "abstract": "The Corona virus pandemic highlighted the importance in continuity of the physical and emotional labour across all care sectors. Synergy between healthcare in hospitals, and community services must be allied with social care; and be central to integrated and efficient policy and service delivery. Services were found wanting in the pandemic and in recurring winter crises. The politics of funding for care delivered in rest and nursing homes remains contested, awaiting long-promised governmental action. The workforce is recognised as dedicated, skilled, compassionate and yet under-valued and under-paid; managers face ongoing recruitment challenges, with a national shortage of staff, and high turnover of personnel. A National Care Service is awaited in England and Wales. This study explores the ongoing care crisis, using the educational lens of threshold concepts, projected, analysed and synthesised of a generic conceptual framework, known as Hodges' model. Readers will understand Hodges' model and threshold concepts being equipped to explain both. The study is descriptive and uses a conceptual mapping approach supported by discussion and literature. Additional resources and avenues for ongoing study are also provided. In conclusion, Hodges' model is a pragmatic, practice-based tool, that can support and sustain curiosity for workforce learning and development.",

    "abstract": "Contested illnesses such as long COVID or post-COVID syndrome create heightened uncertainty for patients as they navigate diagnosis and treatment. To lessen this uncertainty, patients in the United States and Europe have relied on patient activism and patient-led research to seek recognition from medical, scientific and political institutions. However, patients in other countries rely on different sets of strategies. Drawing on a survey (n = 144) and interviews (n = 32) of patients with post-COVID syndrome recruited via social media in Brazil, we found common experiences of psychologisation and dismissal of patient experiences. To combat this dismissal, some patients turned to each other online. However, patient groups showed a preference for advice from credentialled experts rather than asserting the embodied expertise of patients. Similarly, in the construction of alternative expertise networks, patients continued to rely on credentialled experts in the private healthcare system and from foreign and nonstate experts. We discuss how these alternative expertise networks may diminish the possibility of collective mobilisation and how those who are more socioeconomically disadvantaged and under-represented in our study will likely endure additional challenges.",

By temporally distancing from the pandemic, healthcare utilization trends might be re-explored.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study aims to analyze the epidemiologic trends of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) cases at the ED of a tertiary hospital in Crete, Greece, after the COVID-19 pandemic. It investigates changes in patient visit patterns, referral trends, and hospitalization rates.&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A prospective design data collection was conducted on all patients examined by an ENT specialist in the ED of the tertiary hospital of Crete during 2024. Data collected included patients' demographics, diagnosis (ICD-10 coded), referrals, and patient outcomes. Specific Hospitalization Index (SHI) was calculated as a rate of the total cases admitted for a specific ICD-10 by all visits recorded for that ICD-10.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 6,000 patients were examined. The most common diagnoses were acute otitis media (8.1%) and external otitis (7.0%). A total of 373 hospital admissions (6.2%) were recorded, with peritonsillar abscess (91 cases, SHI: 0.892) being the leading cause of in-hospital treatment, followed by vestibular neuronitis (29 cases, SHI: 0.617) and Bell's palsy (26 cases, SHI: 0.268). A total of 196 referrals (3.3%) were recorded, with 49.6% originating from public primary care. A decline was observed in referrals, from public primary care settings, to the same hospital, when compared with 2023 data (p = 0.013).&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; This study underscores the significant role of ENT emergencies for ED workload, indicating a return to pre-pandemic levels of ED overcrowding. The most common diagnoses recorded provided a low SHI, suggesting that they could be managed on an outpatient basis. Future research should focus on enhancing primary care in managing ENT cases to reduce unnecessary ED visits.",

Data were collected from individuals aged 60+ years in urban areas of Nanjing, China, in 2018, 2021 and 2023. Differences in food intake frequencies between participants and survey years were examined. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to identify influencing factors of red plus white meat, and vegetable consumption. Totally, 13792 participants were analyzed, with 4355, 4622 and 4815 from 2018, 2021 and 2023 survey, respectively. The mean weekly intake frequency (± standard deviation) among participants in 2018, 2021 and 2023 was, separately, 3.85±2.83, 3.21±2.90 and 4.71±3.94 for red meat, 1.38±1.21, 2.08±1.90 and 2.73±2.55 for white meat, and 10.98±4.84, 10.00±5.04 and 10.34±5.04 for vegetable. Moreover, 23.2%, 32.6% and 52.3% of participants met recommendation for red plus white meat intake, while 53.7%, 46.8% and 49.6% reached recommendation for vegetable consumption before, during and after COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Red plus white meat intake was positively associated with education, marital status and drinking, but negatively associated with age. Additionally, education and marital status were in negative relation to vegetable consumption, while smoking and drinking were positively associated with vegetable intake. The older residents consumed less red meat and vegetable but more white meat during COVID-19 pandemic, and their consumption levels of red plus white meat and vegetable went up after the pandemic. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to support older adults' dietary habits during emergency events.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the last mile barriers to HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in Kenya and Ireland, highlighting its role in reducing HIV infection among high-risk individuals. Despite PrEP's efficacy, timely access and consistent use are hindered by several obstacles. Using qualitative methods, the study involved 54 interviews (40 in Kenya and 14 in Ireland) and 4 focus group discussions in Kenya, engaging activists, healthcare providers, policymakers and gatekeepers. Fieldwork in Ireland took place online (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) while interviews and focus group discussions in Kenya took place in-person. Data were thematically and comparatively analysed on dedoose.com. Results identified similarities and differences in socio-cultural, economic, structural, and COVID-19 pandemic barriers. In Kenya, community, and healthcare provider stigma, along with infrastructural issues, were significant impediments. In Ireland, the focus on one community limited access for others. Both countries faced additional barriers due to the pandemic, such as lockdowns, movement restrictions, overwhelmed health infrastructure, and fear of contracting COVID-19 during clinic visits. Conclusions emphasise that providing free medicines does not ensure access. Overcoming barriers at the last mile requires more focus and funding, incorporating healthcare providers' and end users' perspectives to improve accessibility on the ground.",

Assessing the effects of GLP-1 on neonates is vital as GLP-1 is increasingly administered during pregnancy. This study evaluates the effect of GLP-1 exposure on maternal complications and neonatal defects in mice. Pregnant female A/J mice received subcutaneous injections of recombinant GLP-1 (rGLP-1; 1000 nmol/kg) on embryonic day 1 (EP, early pregnancy) or day 15 (E15, late pregnancy). Maternal and neonatal body weights, morphology, and mortality were recorded, and mRNA sequencing was conducted to analyze gene expression in neonatal tissues. Maternal body weight decreased following rGLP-1 exposure, and pups born to both the early and late exposure groups experienced significant weight loss. Pups in the late exposure group exhibited uniform skin detachment and a dramatically higher mortality rate than those born to the early exposure group. Further, RT-PCR analysis confirms the significantly increased expression of selected genes in the skin and associated pathogenesis. RNA sequencing of pups' skin, brain, lung, and liver tissues from the late exposure group showed altered gene expression. Since maternal weight loss, increased neonatal mortality, and altered gene expression have been observed, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should be avoided during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Background: There is growing evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to metabolic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which may impair liver function and promote glucose intolerance. This study investigated the role of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its Main Protease (Mpro), in accelerating insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in HepG2 cells in vitro. Methods: HepG2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of Mpro (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL) for 24 h to assess cytotoxicity and glucose uptake. Based on initial findings, subsequent assays focused on higher concentrations (40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL). The effects of Mpro on cell viability, protein kinase B (AKT) expression, matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and lipid peroxidation were investigated. Results: Our findings reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro treatment led to a concentration-dependent reduction in glucose uptake in HepG2 cells. Additionally, the Mpro treatment was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated AKT activation, particularly at higher concentrations. Inflammatory markers such as IL-6 were elevated in the extracellular medium, while DPP4 expression was decreased. However, extracellular soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) levels did not show a significant change. Despite these changes, cell viability remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that the HepG2 cells were able to maintain overall metabolic functions under Mpro exposure. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the concentration-dependent impairment of hepatic glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammatory pathways in HepG2 cells acutely exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These findings warrant further investigation to explore the long-term metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its proteases in the liver and to develop potential therapeutic approaches for post-viral metabolic complications.",

A 58-year-old man with a history of a previous penetrating keratoplasty presented with blurred vision and evidence of corneal endothelitis 48 h after the first dose of the m-RNA vaccination, and a 24-year-old male student came with a dendritic ulcer 72 h post first vaccination dose. The original prophylactic treatment of 400 mg of acyclovir twice daily was increased to five times per day for a week for both patients. The grafted patient additionally received an increase in Dexamethasone 0.1% from twice daily to four times a day. Improvement was noted within two days and documented at the weekly review, during which both patients returned to their prophylactic antiviral regime without further recurrence. At the time of their second dose of vaccination, both patients followed the same regime with an increase in treatment as per the first dose of vaccination without recurrence. Our findings suggest that patients with recurrent herpetic disease receiving prophylactic treatment need close monitoring when experiencing even subtle symptoms of recurrence and may benefit from an increase in their dose to therapeutic levels during the first days after the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.",

The identification of modifiable risk factors may contribute to the development of targeted preventive strategies. This study aimed to assess predictors of cognitive impairment in older adults with and without recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from June 2023 to March 2024 at a tertiary hospital in western Mexico. Adults aged 65 years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the previous six months, along with uninfected controls, were enrolled. Cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (Geriatric Anxiety Inventory), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), functional status (Katz Index and Lawton-Brody Scale), and laboratory markers were evaluated at baseline, three months, and six months. The primary outcome was cognitive impairment at six months. Independent predictors were identified using a multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects model. Results: Among the 111 participants, 20 (18.8%) developed cognitive impairment within six months. Low serum magnesium (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.73; 95% CI 1.04-7.17; p = 0.041) and depression (aRR 5.57; 95% CI 1.88-16.48; p = 0.002) were independently associated with a higher risk. A significant synergistic among COVID-19, depression, and hypomagnesemia was observed (RR 44.30; 95% CI 9.52-206.21; p < 0.001), corresponding to the group with simultaneous presence of all three factors compared to the group with none. Conclusions: Depression and hypomagnesemia appear to be independent predictors of cognitive impairment in older adults with recent COVID-19 infection.

Proteomic cytokine profiling holds promise for refining mortality risk assessment. Serum samples from 89 ICU patients (55 discharged, 34 deceased) were analyzed using a multiplex 21-cytokine panel. Samples were stratified into three groups based on time from collection to outcome: ≤48 h (Group 1: Early), >48 h to ≤7 days (Group 2: Intermediate), and >7 days to ≤14 days (Group 3: Late). Cytokine levels, simple cytokine ratios, and previously unexplored complex ratios between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Machine learning-based feature selection identified the most predictive ratios, with performance evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Complex cytokine ratios demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional severity markers (APACHE II, SAPS II, SOFA), individual cytokines, and simple ratios, effectively distinguishing discharged from deceased patients across all groups (AUC: 0.918-1.000; sensitivity: 0.826-1.000; specificity: 0.775-0.900).

This study aims to determine the bacterial and fungal profile of pathogenic organisms of infections after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This is a retrospective study using the medical records of patients at least 18 years old who were hospitalized with AIS in a tertiary stroke hospital from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022. Demographic, patient-related, and other examination data were extracted from hospital medical records. Infections after AIS were defined as any infection that developed during the acute phase of ischemic stroke and was confirmed by microbiologic culture as the gold standard. Factors associated with infection were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Among 599 AIS patients with infection who underwent microbiologic culture, the prevalence of infection with an isolated pathogen was 21.4%, and most organisms were from sputum. Positive microbiologic culture revealed that bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, E. coli, A. baumannii, and S. aureus were the most common causes of infection, while fungi were rare. During the COVID-19 period, bacteria developed resistance to antimicrobials, including β-lactamase antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria and methicillin for Gram-positive bacteria. Care in the intensive ward, including the stroke unit, reduced the risk of a positive microbiological culture in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 period. Urinary catheters promoted infections in the non-COVID-19 period, whereas steroids, total parenteral nutrition, and tracheostomy were negatively associated with infections after AIS in the COVID-19 period. The prevalence and factors associated with infection after stroke changed during the COVID-19 period. The risk of infection after stroke requires preventive measures such as early dysphagia screening.",

Our study explores how ophthalmologists in Puerto Rico (PR) altered their practices during the pandemic, confronting obstacles such as resource shortages, evolving public health mandates, and unique socio-economic and geographic constraints. The study aims to enhance preparedness for future public health crises. Methods: We conducted descriptive analyses on four online surveys distributed at crucial time points of the pandemic (March 2020, May 2020, August 2020, August 2021) to all practicing ophthalmologists in PR (N ≈ 200), capturing data on closures, patient volume, personal protective equipment (PPE) access, telemedicine use, and financial relief. Results: Survey responses ranged from 41% (n = 81) to 56% (n = 111). By March 2020, 22% (24/111) of respondents closed their offices. By May 2020, 20% (19/93) of respondents maintained a closed office, while 89% (64/72) of open offices reported seeing less than 25% of their usual patient volume. Access to PPE was a challenge, with 59% (65/111) reporting difficulty obtaining N95 masks in March 2020. Telemedicine usage increased initially, peaking in May 2020 and declining in July 2020. By August 2021, all respondents were fully vaccinated and most practices returned to pre-pandemic levels. Overall, 86% (70/81) of respondents found the surveys to be useful for navigating practice changes during the pandemic. Conclusions: PR ophthalmologists showed adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain care given limited resources.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly transformed social life worldwide, indiscriminately affecting individuals across all age groups. Children have not been exempted from the risk of severe illness and death caused by COVID-19. This paper sought to describe the clinical findings, laboratory and imaging results, and hospital care provided for severe and critical cases of COVID-19 in unvaccinated children, with or without severe asthma, hospitalized in a public referral service for COVID-19 treatment in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. This was a case series study of severe and critical COVID-19 in hospitalized, unvaccinated children, with or without severe asthma, conducted in a public referral hospital between March 2020 and June 2021. The case series included 80 children, aged from 1 month to 11 years, with the highest frequency among those under 2 years old (58.8%) and a predominance of males (65%). Respiratory diseases, including severe asthma, were present in 73.8% of the cases. Pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome occurred in 15% of the children, some of whom presented with cardiac involvement. Oxygen therapy was required in 65% of the cases, mechanical ventilation in 15%, and 33.7% of the children required intensive care in a pediatric intensive care unit. Pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities were common findings on chest X-rays and CT scans; inflammatory markers were elevated, and the most commonly used medications were antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids. This case series has identified key characteristics of children with severe and critical COVID-19 during a period when vaccines were not yet available in Brazil for the study age group. However, the persistence of low vaccination coverage, largely due to parental vaccine hesitancy, continues to leave children vulnerable to potentially severe illness from COVID-19. These findings may inform the development of public health emergency contingency plans, as well as clinical protocols and care pathways, which can guide decision-making in pediatric care and ensure appropriate clinical management, ultimately improving the quality of care provided.",

    "title": "Conversion Factors to Compare Serum Concentrations of Anti-HBs, Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and Anti-Tetanus Toxin IgG.",
    "abstract": "Background: The concentration of antigen-specific antibodies in serum is usually measured in international units/mL. Therefore, the actual concentration of virus-specific antibodies in sera is unknown. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine conversion factors for concentrations of IgG against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs), SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (NP) as well as tetanus toxin (Ttx) in serum and to compare antigen-specific IgG concentrations in serum samples. Methods: Absorption equivalence ELISAs were used to determine conversion factors for international units (IU) for anti-HBs, anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD and NP and for anti-Ttx immunoglobulin G. The antigen-specific IgG concentrations in serum samples were then measured in units/mL and the ratio of IgG concentrations in the sera was determined using the conversion factors. Results: One IU of anti-HBs IgG corresponded to 24.4 BAU of anti-CoV-2 RBD IgG, 6.87 BAU of anti-CoV-2 NP and 14 mIU of anti-Ttx IgG. One BAU anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgG is equivalent to 3.5 BAU SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG. Conversion of international units showed that median serum anti-Ttx-IgG concentrations were 50 times higher and anti-CoV-2-RBD-IgG concentrations were 390 times higher than median anti-HBs-IgG concentrations. In addition, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the concentration of NP-specific IgG in serum was generally higher than that of RBD-specific IgG. Conclusions: The study provides conversion factors for serum concentrations of IgG against HBs, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP, as well as Ttx-IgG. This offers new insights into serum IgG concentrations and allows conclusions to be drawn about plasma cell pools.",

    "title": "A 3D Surface Plot for the Effective Visualization of Specific Serum Antibody Binding Properties.",
    "abstract": "When an antigen molecule is exposed to serum, many different kinds of antibodies bind to it. The complexity of these binding events is only poorly characterized by assays that generate a single variable, generally reflecting the fractional saturation of the antigen, as the readout. We have previously devised an assay that delivers the essential biochemical variables to determine fractional saturation as the output: an equilibrium dissociation constant for affinity, the ratio of antibody concentration to the equilibrium constant and the concentration of bound antibodies under reference conditions. Here we propose a visualization method for the practical and informative display of these variables. Using total antigen concentration and free and bound antibody concentration as coordinates in a three-dimensional space, a surface plot can depict the behavior of serum antibodies in the measurement range and identify the values of the key variables of binding activity. This surface display (antibody binding in 3-concentration display, Ab3cD) was used for the characterization of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in seronegative and seropositive sera. We demonstrate that this visualization scheme is suitable for presenting both individual and group differences and that epitope density changes, not commonly measured by immunoassays, are also revealed by the method. We recommend the use of 3D visualization whenever detailed, informative and characteristic differences in serum antibody reactivity are studied.",

This study aimed to explore the experiences of bereaved people participating in in-person bereavement groups during the pandemic, as an illustration of how offering bereavement support can be adapted in response to societal crises. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using content analysis. The main category identified was 'the need to tell my story in times of isolation' emphasising the need to meet others in in-person meetings. Five sub-categories emerged: 'supportive storytelling for myself and for others', 'impact of the pandemic', 'role of the counsellors', 'homogeneity and design of the groups' and 'life after bereavement groups'. Participants were clear that they preferred in-person bereavement groups. Meetings outdoors were made possible through the counsellors' prudence and imagination.

    "abstract": "Efficient execution of medication management strategies, such as medication reviews, is crucial for reducing potential medication-related harms and improving treatment effectiveness. We assessed the perspectives of primary care professionals on how the rapid integration of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic affected medication management in primary care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 27 family medicine clinicians, support staff, and administrators. Interview questions focused on primary care processes, care delivery, and the use of telehealth technology during the pandemic. Codes were initially developed a priori using the interview guide and iteratively revised based on data and consensus meetings. The final coding structure was then used to analyze all transcripts. Participants were predominantly physicians (65.4%) who practiced family medicine (89.5%). Primary care professionals indicated that the swift integration of telehealth significantly affected the medication review and reconciliation procedures established within their practices, sometimes causing potential risks to medication safety, while others observed no significant changes in this process. Among the notable changes were the increased workload on providers and a reduced role of the collaborative team-based approach. Overall, providers recognized both the benefits and challenges of using telehealth for medication management. The rapid adoption of telehealth during the pandemic influenced medication management strategies, posing challenges to patient safety through changes in medication reconciliation processes and lack of team-based approaches to medication management. Ensuring patient safety in primary care settings through telehealth services requires the strategic integration of evidence-based medication safety processes in telehealth service delivery designs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need and value of a standardised and timely surveillance system for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to inform epidemic preparedness and response.AIMWe aimed to develop an automated SARI surveillance system using electronic health records retrieved from pre-existing national health registers in Denmark.METHODSWe used the Danish Civil Register, the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish Microbiology Database to set up the system. First, we determined a SARI case definition for surveillance, choosing among six different potentially usable combinations of ICD-10 diagnosis codes by exploring how each combination captured patient characteristics (age, hospital admission length, mortality, laboratory tests and seasonality). Second, using this case definition, we evaluated the surveillance system's timeliness and completeness by comparing weekly data reported with a delay of 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 days, respectively, against a complete set of data extracted after 120 days.RESULTSThe selected case definition combined ICD-10 codes for influenza (J09-J11), acute lower viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections and bronchiolitis (J12-J22) and COVID-19 (B342A and B972A). With regards to timeliness and completeness of this definition, weekly data reported with a delay of 8 days was 89-93% complete and showed very similar patterns in weekly changes in SARI cases as data reported after 120 days.CONCLUSIONOur SARI surveillance system detected fluctuations in weekly SARI cases in a consistent and timely manner. We recommend countries to explore using electronic health registers as a resource-efficient alternative to standard SARI sentinel surveillance.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether delays in care during the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) were associated with pathological stage progression in urological malignancies by comparing surgical outcomes between pre-pandemic era (PREP) and pandemic-era (POSTP) cohorts. We conducted a retrospective before-and-after cohort study at a tertiary academic center. A total of 368 patients underwent radical surgeries for prostate (n=176), bladder (n=78), kidney (n=78), or testicular (n=36) cancers between April 2019 and March 2022. Patients were grouped into PREP (April 2019-March 2020) and POSTP (April 2020-March 2022) cohorts. Clinical, laboratory, and pathological data were compared using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. POSTP prostatectomy patients had significantly higher preoperative PSA levels (13.2 ± 16.2 vs. 7.7 ± 4.5 ng/mL, p<0.001), greater tumor involvement (17.0% vs. 11.5%, p=0.019), and increased extraprostatic extension (33.7% vs. 11.9%, p=0.006) compared to PREP patients. Renal tumors were significantly larger during the pandemic (7.4 cm vs. 6.0 cm, p=0.01), and preoperative hemoglobin levels were lower (11.7 vs. 12.9 g/dL, p<0.001), suggesting more advanced disease. No statistically significant differences were observed in pathological staging for bladder or testicular cancers between the two periods (all p>0.05). COVID-19-related care disruptions were associated with adverse pathological features in prostate and renal cancers. In contrast, bladder and testicular cancers showed no significant stage migration. These findings emphasize the need for resilient cancer care pathways to prevent progression during future healthcare crises.",

    "abstract": "During the coronavirus pandemic, several factors such as stress, depression, infection, and vaccination against the COVID-19 virus have caused changes in the menstrual cycle. This systematic review intended to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the changes in the menstrual cycle of women of reproductive age and menopause after coronavirus vaccination. Method: Electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Cochrane, SAGE, Springer, Google Scholar, and CINHAL were searched for published studies from March 2020 to June 2023. Of the 682 references identified in the initial search, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results of this systematic review showed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a wide range of menstrual disorders in women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women. The most commonly reported disorders were menorrhagia, delayed menstruation, changes in menstrual cycle length, spotting between periods, and increased bleeding volume. In postmenopausal women, complications such as spotting and resumption of bleeding were also observed. Although the prevalence and incidence of each disorder varied across studies, these findings suggest that vaccination can lead to changes in the menstrual cycle. COVID-19 vaccination may lead to menstrual disorders in women of reproductive and postmenopausal age, which can cause concern and reduce social and psychological quality of life. However, these effects are usually temporary and transient, resolving after a few menstrual cycles. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible mechanisms of this association and identify associated risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) are major global health concerns, with a rising prevalence worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The interplay between these chronic conditions and COVID-19 presents a unique public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh. This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence of DM and HT among individuals affected by COVID-19 pandemic in Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh, and (2) explore associations with sociodemographic and biological factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh between April and August 2021. Data was collected from 390 COVID-19-positive patients using a structured questionnaire and physical measurements, focusing on sociodemographic and biological factors associated with DM and HT. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors. Among participants, 12.05% had DM, 15.89% had HT, and 7.95% had both. Older age ( > 50 years) was significantly associated with higher prevalence of both conditions (p <  0.001). Females were more likely to have DM (16.6% vs. 9.2%), HT (19.2% vs. 13.8%), and both (10.6% vs. 6.3%) than males (p <  0.05). Private or self-employed individuals had a significantly higher risk of both DM and HT (RRR: 7.66, 95% CI: 4.26-12.37, p <  0.001). Obesity (BMI ≥ 25) was linked to increased prevalence of DM (13.2%), HT (21.0%), and both (10.2%). Elevated SBP and DBP were strongly associated with comorbidity (p <  0.001), and tobacco use increased the odds of DM (AOR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.13-5.29, p =  0.02). Targeted interventions, such as community-based education, improved chronic disease management, and culturally tailored strategies, are recommended to address these conditions effectively. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and conducting longitudinal research to explore causal pathways will be critical in mitigating the impact of these comorbidities and improving pandemic preparedness in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Jing Guan Fang, a formula based on Forsythia suspensa, is commonly used for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviating cold-like symptoms. However, the precise immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear and warrant investigation. This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of JGF and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that JGF had minimal impact on the cell viability of RAW264.7 and MH-S. In the absence of LPS stimulation, JGF promoted macrophages to produce NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner. However, after LPS treatment, the JGF add-on exhibited contrasting effects, with the half-maximal effective concentrations for reducing macrophage-secreted NO and IL-6 being 80 and 180 μg/mL, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that the JGF supplement marginally induced the production of iNOS and COX-2 without LPS stimulation. However, in LPS-pretreated cells, JGF demonstrated the opposite effect. JGF monotherapy accelerated phosphorylation in the JNK and JAK2 signaling pathways. In contrast, JGF inhibited LPS-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation by suppressing JNK1/2 activation. Moreover, JGF reduced LPS-induced expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the lungs and serum of mice. Collectively, the findings suggest that JGF exhibits immunomodulatory activity and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine expression caused by LPS.",

Many of these interventions gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic when mandated social isolation required the rapid implementation of remote care models. While these digital health interventions have since demonstrated promise in delivering care to otherwise isolated communities, the ongoing need for more evidence proving their positive impact on important clinical outcomes remains a barrier to their full implementation.

We retrospectively analyzed all adult patients screened for aPL during acute COVID-19 in our institution between April 2020 and April 2022. Only patients with at least one follow-up ≥3 months post-infection were included. Among 114 patients (median age 64.0 years, 44.7% female), 19 (16.7%) developed long COVID. Those with long COVID were younger and more frequently admitted to ICU than those who recovered. However, aPL positivity did not differ significantly between patients with and without long COVID (63.2% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.79).

However, infection of pigs older than 5 days of age does not usually result in obvious clinical symptoms. This relative intrinsic safety in older animals prompted us to investigate the potential of SADS-CoV as a viral vector for porcine diarrhea virus vaccines. We utilized Gibson assembly to clone the SADS-CoV sequence into an artificial bacterial chromosome (BAC) vector. Further manipulation was carried out by recombineering to generate four attenuated recombinant SADS-CoV strains expressing a PEDV protective antigen fused with peptides that target immune cells. Subsequently, the biological characteristics and immunogenic efficacy of these four recombinant strains were systematically assessed through in vitro cell models and in vivo animal challenge experiments. The recombinant viruses exhibited a proliferation profile similar to that of the wild-type virus in Vero cells, maintained stable cytopathic effects, retained the exogenous sequences for up to 20 passages, and consistently expressed the PEDV antigen fusion protein. Immunizing pregnant sows with these recombinant viruses effectively enhanced both cellular and mucosal immune responses and provided significant clinical protection against PEDV to their offspring. This study not only generated a vaccine candidate for PEDV but also established a pipeline for using the SADS-CoV as a vector for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 and HIV pandemics have disproportionately affected Black and Latino sexual minority men (BLSMM) in the United States, with them having the highest burden of disease. Despite this disparity, few studies have examined the intersection of COVID-19 mitigation measures, access to healthcare, and other social determinants during the COVID-19 pandemic among BLSMM. To fill this gap in the literature, the purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the pandemic on mental and physical health, access to healthcare, and resource security among BLSMM. Using an interpretive phenomenological approach, we conducted individual interviews with 41 participants between August 2021 and December 2022. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Participants ranged in age from 19-65 years. The majority described their gender as male (93%). Black participants comprised the majority of the sample (73%), with 25% identified as Latino. Participants' narratives indicated a sense of hopelessness, despair, anxiety, and depression-all amplified by social isolation experienced from COVID-19 shelter-in-place (SIP) orders. Fear of contracting COVID-19 disrupted engagement in healthcare. Resource security was exacerbated by unemployment, resulting in food and housing insecurity and reliance on government assistance programs. These findings highlight the pandemic's impact on participants' mental and physical health, access to healthcare, and resource security. Our findings suggest a more nuanced and culturally tailored public health response approach, expanding telemedicine to increase access to healthcare, and other governmental policy changes to increase access to affordable housing and food, regardless of immigration status.",

This study evaluated the current status of CVH in US adults using the LE8 score and compared the overall CVH and each CVH metric between the pre-COVID-19 era and the COVID-19 era. Participants aged 20 to 79 years without a history of cardiovascular disease in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles from 2017 to 2023 were included. The LE8 score and its components were analyzed in the entire population and further categorized by gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, household poverty, and depression. CVH scores were also assessed between the pre-COVID-19 era and the COVID-19 era. Sample weights and design were incorporated to calculate prevalence estimates and standard errors using standard survey procedures. Among 11,939 adults, representing approximately 207,742,565 US adults, the mean overall CVH score was 68.5 (95 % CI, 67.6-69.4). Significant differences in mean overall CVH scores were observed by gender (women: 69.8; men: 67.2) and age groups (20-44 years: 72.1; 45-64 years: 65.5; 65-79 years: 65.2). Overall CVH scores were highest among non-Hispanic (NH) Asian (75.2) individuals, followed by NH White (69.0), other Hispanic (68.4), Mexican (67.6), and NH Black (64.6). Diet, physical activity, and body mass index had the lowest mean scores, while sleep health and blood glucose had the highest. Substantial differences in mean scores across demographic groups were observed for body mass index (range, 49.4-78.5), blood glucose (range, 73.4-92.4), and blood pressure (range, 55.4-82.2). Overall mean CVH scores significantly improved during the COVID-19 era (70.2 vs. 68.9) compared to the pre-COVID-19 era, primarily driven by increased scores on physical activity (72.8 vs. 52.4) and nicotine exposure (74.4 vs. 70.2). The prevalence of high CVH was significantly higher during the COVID-19 era compared to the pre-COVID-19 era (26.7 % vs. 22.2 %), while the prevalence of low CVH was decreased (7.6 % vs. 13.6 %). Despite improvements during the COVID-19 era, overall CVH among US adults remains suboptimal. Future research should prioritize interventions aimed at enhancing the CVH of the US population.",

We find that the effort to reduce infection rates was more successful in the UK than in the EU, and that the deaths due to the trade vector were 10% on average across Europe. Our results imply that without the policy response in Europe, the number of deaths during the first wave would have been about 4,520,000 higher in the EU and around 1,240,000 greater in the UK, with significant variations across regions. Oberbayern in Germany and South Yorkshire in the UK appear as the most effective in reducing the death burden of COVID-19 at different points during the first wave. Moreover, 42% and 37% of the total deaths in the UK and the EU, respectively, could have been prevented if the policy implemented in these two regions had prevailed throughout Europe.",

There is an increasing demand for highly sensitive, rapid, and simple diagnostic assays capable of detecting viral infection across various species. In this study, we developed a biosensor assay based on a blocking ELISA (bELISA) immunoassay format. The assay employs a photonic crystal (PC) biosensor, gold-nanoparticle (AuNP) tags, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, and specific anti-N monoclonal antibody (mAb) to detect antibody responses in animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Based on an evaluation of 162 cat serum samples with known antibody status, an optimal percentage of inhibition (PI) cut-off value of 0.5877 resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.80% and a diagnostic specificity of 98.67%. The assay demonstrated high repeatability with low variation coefficients across different conditions, ensuring consistent performance. Additionally, the assay successfully detected anti-N antibody responses in ferrets and deer as early as 14 days post-infection (DPI), and in cats infected with both Omicron (B.1.1.529) and B.1 D614G (B.1) variants as early as 7 DPI. These results highlight the assay's ability to detect infections early and reliably across species and its capability to identify multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2. This test platform provides an important tool for rapid field surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection across multiple species.",

Recently liposomal drug delivery platforms have demonstrated promising results in enhancing the effectiveness of various therapeutics including infectious diseases. In this study, we designed a liposomal delivery system containing vitamin C to evaluate its antiviral efficacy in COVID-19, focusing on its effects on viral entry gene expression in Vero cells. Vitamin C was loaded into a liposome made up of hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy (polyethylene glycol)-2000], and their physicochemical properties were assessed. Next, the cytotoxicity of free and liposomal vitamin C on the survival of the Vero cell line was evaluated using the MTT assay. In addition, the expression of viral entry genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), key mediators of SARS-CoV-2 entry into kidney cells, was investigated using RTq-PCR. Liposomes were successfully loaded with vitamin C, achieving an encapsulation efficiency of 88.03%. The liposomal vitamin C formulation exhibited a brilliant surface morphology as observed by SEM. Both free and liposomal forms of vitamin C showed cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations. Moreover, both forms downregulated the expression of viral entry genes, although the liposomal form showed superior inhibitory performance compared to the free form.

    "abstract": "Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are at a higher risk of bacterial and fungal infections. Procalcitonin is an inflammatory marker that has been suggested for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections that predicting bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 and serving as a helpful indicator for determining the severity of the illness. This study aimed to evaluate procalcitonin levels and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among microbial co-infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Clinical and microbiological data were obtained from the medical records of 100 COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with bacterial infections had a 55% mortality rate. The majority of microbial cultures were detected in blood (49%), sputum (44%), and urine (7%). Among the isolates, 57.7% were Gram-negative bacteria, 31.7% were Gram-positive bacteria, 6.7% were mixed isolates, and 3.8% were fungal isolates. The predominant Gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (37.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (20.2%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.4%). Candida albicans (2.9%) was the most commonly isolated fungal pathogen, followed by Aspergillus spp. (1%). Most of the isolates showed high resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Gram-negative bacteria were detected in 29% of COVID-19 patients who died, Gram-positive bacteria in 20%, and mixed bacteria in 6%. The majority of surviving patients had procalcitonin levels below 0.25 ng/mL, whereas non- survivors had higher levels. Secondary microbial infections in COVID-19 patients remain a critical concern during the pandemic. Additionally, multidrug-resistant organisms are an increasing challenge. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, baseline procalcitonin levels were associated with patient outcomes and bacterial coinfection.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects the respiratory system and occasionally the gastrointestinal system, and it was declared a pandemic in 2020. Haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein and a potent antioxidant in the body, which exerts its antioxidant effect by binding to free hemoglobin. Haptoglobin has three main variants (Hp1-1, Hp1-2, Hp2-2), each with different antioxidant capacities. The purpose of this study is to investigate frequency of the haptoglobin variants in COVID-19 patients compared to a control group. This study was conducted on 148 COVID-19 patients and 145 healthy individuals from the Sistan and Baluchestan province. DNA was isolated from whole blood using the salt precipitation method, and the determination of haptoglobin genotypes (Hp1-1, Hp1-2, and Hp2-2) was performed using Conventional PCR. This study analyzed haptoglobin (HP) genotypes in COVID-19 patients and controls, finding no significant difference in HP variant frequencies between groups (p= 0.529). However, the HP1-2 genotype was associated with a twofold increased COVID-19 risk in men (OR=2.069, p= 0.021), and the HP1 allele significantly raised infection risk (OR= 1.62, p= 0.039). Hospitalizations and respiratory symptoms were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (p= 0.0001 and p= 0.0176, respectively). These results suggest that haptoglobin variants are not risk factors for COVID-19 infection in the overall population (both males and females). However, men with the HP1-2 genotype are 1.9 times more likely to develop COVID-19 infection compared to men with HP1-1 and HP 2-2 genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater surveillance is a critical tool in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet traditional centralized methods are unsustainable due to their high costs and complex implementation requirements. Here, we introduce Wastewater Analysis and Tracking for Epidemiological Recognition: Necessary Early Warning System (WATER NEWS)-a field clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-diagnostic approach designed for robust and cost-effective pathogen detection in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). WATER NEWS combined a one-pot assay, an optimized reporter probe, on-site nucleic acid extraction, an improved freeze-drying process and a user-friendly, low-cost, battery-operated device, thereby overcoming the limitations of field-deployable wastewater surveillance. In evaluations across 25 WWTPs in 10 Chinese cities, WATER NEWS achieved sensitivities exceeding 90% and specificities of 100% in SARS-CoV-2 detection from the influent and effluent samples of WWTPs. Notably, the system consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 presence within 20 days at a local WWTP. Economic analysis reveals that our approach achieved a 6.5-fold cost reduction compared with clinical testing and costs nearly half that of traditional wastewater surveillance methods, making it a viable and sustainable option for wastewater surveillance.",

    "abstract": "When SARS-CoV-2 became regional epidemics, a substantial number of patients suffered from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, aka long COVID). Exploring the pathogenesis and especially the heterogenicity features of long COVID subgroups is of paramount importance for understanding its etiology. In this study, through integrative multi-omics analyses encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, long COVID patients exhibited overall elevated MAPK pathway activation, while patients who have recovered from long COVID showed down-regulation of this response. Long COVID heterogenicity is described by multi-omics distinct signatures for each subgroup. The Multisystemic (MULTI) symptom subgroup is characterized by enhanced glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, Neurological (NEU) by augmented glycoprotein synthesis metabolism, Cardio cerebral (CACRB) by increased pyruvate metabolism and suppressed macrophage polarization, Musculoskeletal + Systemic (MSK + SYST) by elevated glycerophospholipid metabolism, and Cardiopulmonary (CAPM) by inhibited NF-κB signaling pathways. ABHD17A, CSNK1D, PSME4 and SYVN1 were general long COVID combination biomarkers, while CRH (MULTI), FPGT (NEU), CBX6 (CACRB) and RBBP4 (CAPM) were selected as serum-specific subgroup proteins.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health systems, with emerging evidence suggesting unique implications for pediatric populations with endocrine disorders. While children generally experience milder acute COVID-19 symptoms, those with pre-existing endocrine conditions may face heightened risks due to the interplay between viral infection and endocrine homeostasis. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the relationship between endocrine disorders and COVID-19 severity in children, focusing on disease outcomes, metabolic control, and management challenges during the pandemic. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Ten studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected after screening 638 records. Data were extracted on study characteristics, patient demographics, endocrine disorders, COVID-19 severity outcomes, and key findings. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool. A narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes. The review revealed significant pandemic-related disruptions in pediatric endocrine health, including increased central precocious puberty cases and elevated BMI z-scores in children with obesity. Diabetes outcomes were mixed: type 1 diabetes patients had better mortality prognoses than type 2 diabetes patients, but diabetic ketoacidosis rates surged. Thyroid dysfunction and stable medication adherence in congenital adrenal hyperplasia were also noted. Risk of bias varied, with three studies rated low, five rated moderate, and two rated as high risk of bias. COVID-19 exacerbated endocrine disorders in children through direct viral effects and indirect lifestyle and healthcare disruptions. The findings underscore the need for adaptive care strategies, including telehealth and mental health support, to mitigate long-term impacts. Future research should prioritize prospective studies to evaluate sustained effects and interventions for at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of moderate and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their association with avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head has raised concern. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the severity of COVID-19 and functional outcome in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) for post-COVID-19 steroid-induced AVN. This prospective observational study was conducted on 26 patients diagnosed with steroid-induced AVN of the femoral head following moderate or severe COVID-19 infection. All patients underwent cementless THR. The severity of COVID-19, steroid exposure, time to symptom onset, and preoperative and postoperative hip function were recorded. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Harris hip score (MHHS) at 12 months. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher total dose and longer steroid exposure (mean 2759.1 mg, 25.76 days) and earlier onset of hip pain (mean 54.1 days) than those with moderate infection (mean 1248.8 mg; 16.8 days, and 81.2 days, respectively). Both groups showed significant improvement in postoperative MHHS, with the moderate group achieving slightly higher scores (mean 89.2 vs. 85.8). The severity of AVN, total steroid dose, and duration had no significant association with outcome. While THR provided satisfactory outcomes in all cases, patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited marginally better functional recovery, suggesting that infection severity and steroid burden may influence postoperative prognosis.",

    "abstract": "There are few clinical studies related to COVID-19 in pediatric cancer patients, and systematic reviews or meta-analyses on its mortality risk factors are particularly lacking. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to systematically analyze the mortality risk factors of pediatric cancer patients after COVID-19 infection, providing effective evidence-based medical evidence for epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment of pediatric COVID-19 patients. Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched using \"cancer\" \"COVID-19\" \"children\" \"mortality\" related subject headings and keywords. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Outcomes included age, weight, clinical complications in patients, cancer type, consolidation of cancer treatment, and critical illness. The quality of observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which includes criteria such as study population selection, comparability, and evaluation of exposure or outcome, by two independent reviewers. A computerized search of the literature yielded six observational studies with a total of 2,696 patients, and a pooled assessment of predictive factors revealed that the occurrence of adverse clinical complications, the presence of solid tumors, and the presence of acute and critical conditions significantly increased mortality in pediatric oncology patients (P < 0.05), although, overall, aggressive consolidation of cancer treatment significantly reduced the death of patients. Although overall,being in the cancer consolidation treatment period is significantly associated with a reduced risk of patient mortality, there is still an increase in mortality with Radiotherapy, possibly due to immunocompromise (P < 0.05), whereas Immunotherapy and Surgery do not affect patient prognosis. Subgroup analyses showed that prolonged consolidation of cancer treatment reduced mortality. The sensitivity analysis of the results of the outcome indicators was stable with low sensitivity and high confidence. Adverse clinical complications, the presence of solid tumors, and the occurrence of critical conditions increase mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Receiving aggressive cancer treatment is associated with lower mortality rates, but this association should be interpreted with caution, as it may be confounded by other factors. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD420250570932.",

    "title": "Bridging the gap between CVD and COVID-19: the oxidized LDL hypothesis.",
    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus and the causative agent of COVID-19. The viral envelope includes the spike (S) glycoprotein which mediates the entry of the virus to the host cell. The S protein comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor on the surface of target cells. ACE 2 is highly expressed on the endothelium lining blood vessels which may explain the cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) may share important mechanisms that regulate their pathogenesis and that endothelial dysfunction (ED), which has been already shown to be tightly linked to CVD, plays an instrumental role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by mainly affecting the hyperinflammatory and coaguloatory states that are seen during disease progression. Meanwhile, there is also increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19-linked ED is due to a dysregulation in lipid metabolism pathways. Of note, it has been reported that low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels correlate with the severity of COVID-19 through a potential impairment in the antioxidant capacity of HDL which may lead to lipid oxidation and the generation of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL). Interestingly, we have previously shown that myeloperoxidase oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) possesses an anti-fibrinolytic activity in endothelial cells; this may negatively affect the course of COVID-19 by increasing the chance of complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation events and ischemic strokes. In this article, I hypothesize that targeting inflammatory dyslipidemia could be highly beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients and improving their clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "As pharmacy education in Saudi Arabia progresses in accordance with Saudi Vision 2030 and international competency-based standards, the necessity for systematic evaluation of Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) has become essential. This study aimed to establish a scalable framework for evaluating PLOs' achievement under the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA) criteria. A mixed-methods methodology was utilized in a public pharmacy institution in Saudi Arabia. Eight PLOs derived from the Pharm.D program framework were assessed utilizing stakeholder feedback and national quality standards. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was employed to prioritize outcomes, while the Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis (MOORA) technique was utilized to evaluate performance over five graduating cohorts (2018-2022). Data sources comprised alumni employment data, postgraduate enrollment, and professional practice positions. A program based on Microsoft Access was created for data administration and visualization. PLO2 (clinical application) and PLO5 (ethics and professionalism) earned the greatest AHP weights, measuring 0.28 and 0.19, respectively. Composite MOORA scores exhibited optimal performance in 2020 (0.883) and declined to 0.792 in 2022. The decline in 2022 may be attributed to reduced clinical training opportunities and delayed workforce absorption following COVID-19-related disruptions, as documented in comparable educational settings. The technology facilitated long-term trend analysis and cohort-specific reporting. The holistic monitoring tool established a durable framework for evaluating PLOs attainment by national accreditation standards. It facilitated evidence-based enhancements to the curriculum and enhanced institutional quality assurance. The widespread application of this strategy in pharmacy colleges, including digital integration and external benchmarking, can increase accreditation preparedness and facilitate ongoing educational enhancement.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants has underscored the need to understand not only the structural basis of antibody recognition but also the dynamic and allosteric mechanisms that could be the underlying contributors to their complex broad and escape-resistant neutralization activities. In this study, we employed a multi-scale approach integrating structural analysis, hierarchical molecular simulations, mutational scanning and network-based allosteric modeling to dissect how class 4 antibodies (represented by S2X35, 25F9, and SA55) and class 5 antibodies (represented by S2H97, WRAIR-2063 and WRAIR-2134) can modulate conformational behavior, binding energetics, allosteric interactions and immune escape patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using hierarchical simulations of the antibody complexes with the spike protein and ensemble-based mutational scanning of binding interactions we showed that these antibodies through targeting conserved cryptic sites can exert allosteric effects that influence global conformational dynamics in the RBD functional regions. The ensemble-based mutational scanning of binding interactions revealed excellent agreement with experimentally derived deep mutational scanning (DMS) data accurately recapitulating the known binding hotspots and escape mutations across all studied antibodies. The predicted destabilization values in functional sites are consistent with experimentally observed reductions in antibody binding affinity and immune escape profiles demonstrating that computational models can robustly reproduce and forecast mutation-induced immune escape trends. Using dynamic network modeling we characterized the antibody-induced changes in residue interaction networks and long-range interactions. The results revealed that class 4 antibodies can exhibit distinct patterns of allosteric influence despite targeting overlapping regions, while class 5 antibodies elicit consistently dense and broadly distributed allosteric networks and long-range stabilization of the RBD conformations. Dynamic network analysis identifies a conserved allosteric network core that mediates long-range interactions and includes antibody specific allosteric extensions that connect the binding interface hotspots with allosteric hubs. This study suggests that mechanisms of binding and immune escape for classes of antibodies targeting cryptic binding sites may be determined by the confluence of multiple factors including high-affinity binding, long-range allosteric effects that modulate RBD adaptability and propagation of dynamic constraints that can reshape the conformational equilibrium and ultimately determine efficacy and neutralization patterns.",

    "abstract": "Default videolaryngoscopy - use of a videolaryngoscope in preference to a direct laryngoscope - remains a hotly debated topic. High-risk tracheal intubations performed during the COVID-19 pandemic added to the extensive existing evidence of advantages of videolaryngoscopy for patients and staff. Despite this, and calls for implementation of default videolaryngoscopy, it has not been adopted widely. We summarise current evidence for the benefits of videolaryngoscopy and discuss (and where appropriate dispute) the common reasons given for not using videolaryngoscopy. The experiences of five UK NHS hospitals which have made a move to default videolaryngoscopy are described, with practical advice to assist other hospitals planning similar projects. Several recent large randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses, incorporating data from over 200 trials, support the use of videolaryngoscopes. Guidelines and reports published since 2015 have recommended immediate access to videolaryngoscopes plus training and skill acquisition in the required techniques. Recent guidelines have recommended the routine use of videolaryngoscopes whenever possible. Reported advantages include: technical benefits (improved safety, efficacy and ease of tracheal intubation plus fewer complications); non-technical benefits (including improved teamwork and communication); improved direct laryngoscopy training; and environmental benefits. Reasons cited for not using a videolaryngoscope include concerns that they: are unnecessary; lead to decay in or failure to learn direct laryngoscopy skills; videolaryngoscopy failure; ineffectiveness in a soiled airway; cost; and challenges relating to decontamination of reusable blades. We discuss these and, where appropriate, provide counter arguments. This narrative review provides the relevant evidence and information for clinicians, managers, procurement teams and sterile services departments to use, should a business case be proposed to implement default videolaryngoscopy. We describe effective practical strategies for addressing implementation challenges. Doctors often use a tool called a laryngoscope to help put a breathing tube into a person's throat. There are two kinds: a regular one (called a direct laryngoscope) and a video one (called a videolaryngoscope). Some doctors think the video one is better and safer, especially for hard cases. But even with lots of proof, many hospitals still don't use the video kind all the time. This report looks at the research showing why the video laryngoscope is useful. It also talks about common reasons people give for not using it and explains why those reasons might not be right. It shares what five hospitals in the UK did to start using the video kind as their first choice and gives tips for others who want to do the same. Big studies that looked at over 200 trials say the video laryngoscope works well. Since 2015, expert groups have said hospitals should have these tools ready and train doctors to use them. New rules even say they should be used as the normal choice when possible. The video laryngoscope helps doctors see better and avoid problems. It also helps teams work together better and makes training easier. Some people worry the video tool is too expensive, too hard to clean or won't work in certain situations. The report talks about these worries and gives reasons why they may not be true. This report gives useful facts and ideas to help doctors, hospital leaders and equipment teams decide if they want to switch to using the video laryngoscope as the first choice. It also gives helpful steps to make the change smoother.",

This study's objectives were: 1) to develop a deeper understanding of leadership practices that led to successful responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to learn about the underlying principles and practices that may help in preparing for the next pandemic. Senior leaders (14/23 or 61%) from across a multisite, multicountry integrated health system were recruited using maximum variation sampling. Individual recorded interviews (averaging 20 minutes) were based on principles of Appreciative Inquiry and critical incident reporting. Iterative consensus coding produced 6 major themes: self- and situation awareness, teamwork, readiness, inspirational leadership, internal communication, and external communication. Beyond individual leadership decisions, organizational culture, shared cognition, and history may play a major role in shaping system-wide responses to catastrophic events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of preparation for dealing with novel events and one-way communication may be risk factors for chaotic and ineffective responses. Senior leaders must balance clinical necessity with humanistic values and purpose. Situation awareness and attention to organizational culture may improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of responses to the next pandemic threat.",

    "title": "Using non-linear slide decks to administer individualized problem-based learning assessments within pharmacology education.",
    "abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an established approach in medical, nursing, pharmacy and veterinary medicine education. This study describes the implementation and aims to evaluate the use of non-linear slide decks as a method to deliver PBL as individualized student assessments within pharmacology education. This approach, originally developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been evaluated over 5 years since its integration within undergraduate pharmacology modules. Two non-linear slide decks were designed using Microsoft PowerPoint with interactive hyperlink navigation, allowing dynamic and student-directed progression through two scenarios: a summative clinical toxicology assessment and a formative pharmacokinetic calculation activity. Comparative analysis of student performance demonstrated that grades achieved via non-linear PBL (67.6 ± 10.4%, n = 140) were comparable to those from essays (65.3 ± 12.7%, n = 83) and oral presentations (66.0 ± 6.5%, n = 56), though lower than online quizzes (71.4 ± 11.3%, n = 141). Furthermore, student feedback (n = 31) demonstrated positive student perceptions of non-linear PBL. Despite the increased complexity involved in developing and integrating non-linear PBL resources, this methodology offers an engaging, flexible and pedagogically robust strategy that promotes active learning. It addresses long-standing challenges associated with group-based PBL formats while meeting recommended pharmacology education curricula.",

    "abstract": "Immune tolerance restricts the number of T cells with significant affinity for self tumor associated antigens (TAA), thereby limiting successful cancer immunotherapy through an inability to generate populations of high affinity anti-tumor T cells. In contrast, viral infection/vaccination primes and expands high affinity effector and memory T cells against viral antigens. We show here that it is possible to exploit population-wide pre-existing, anti-viral memory recall responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to focus a high affinity, immuno-dominant T cell response into tumors by oncolytic virus (OV)-, or CAR-, mediated-, delivery of viral antigen(s) which are not themselves related to TAA. Heterologous prime and OV/boost led to CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor cures using either SARS-CoV-2 Mem or SPIKE proteins as vaccinating/tumor focusing T cell targets, associated with epitope spreading against TAA. We also show that CAR T cells carry SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing vectors systemically to tumors even in pre-immune mice. Finally, SPIKE-specific CAR T cells could be boosted in vivo with SPIKE vaccines to enhance anti-tumor activity and persistence. Thus, where high affinity anti-tumor T cells are not available, boosting pre-existing infection-, or vaccination-, induced T cell populations within tumors using OV-mediated immunogen delivery provides a therapeutically valuable alternative.",

This survey was conducted in November 2020. 1461 participants (convenient sampling method) completed the online questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) which included Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS). The relationship between HRQoL and the willingness of COVID-19 vaccination was assessed by multivariate logistic regression. 25.67% of respondents intended to be vaccinated immediately, 61.05% hesitated, and 13.28% refused. The mean score of PCS was 51.27 ± 6.30 and MCS was 47.72 ± 9.26. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the correlation between HRQoL and the willingness of vaccination (Ρ<0.05). Based on Z-score standardization, for 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in PCS, the odds ratio (OR) was 0.854 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.753-0.969) for hesitant vaccination vs. immediate vaccination. For 1 SD increase in MCS, the OR was 0.810 (95% CI: 0.677-0.970) for reluctant vaccination (refusal of COVID-19 vaccination) vs immediate vaccination, and the OR was 0.808 (95% CI: 0.710-0.919) for hesitant vaccination vs immediate vaccination. People with better HRQoL preferred to receive the COVID-19 vaccine immediately.",

Because of the considerable spectral overlap, six mathematical spectrophotometric approaches were applied, including ratio derivative, ratio difference, mean centering of ratio spectra, area under the curve, Q-analysis, and bivariate calibration, to allow accurate interference-free determination without preliminary separation. The proposed methods were validated as per ICH guidelines, demonstrating excellent linearity over the concentration ranges of 1-15 µg/mL for RDV and 1-10 µg/mL for MFX, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. They showed high sensitivity with LODs from 0.26 to 0.92 µg/mL and LOQs from 0.27 to 0.96 µg/mL for both drugs, enabling reliable trace analysis of the studied drugs in complex matrices. The methods also applied to dosage forms and spiked human plasma provided good recoveries with minimal matrix interference, demonstrating that the methods are robust and applicable. Eco-Scale, ComplexGAPI, and AGREE gave a high score on green profiles for environmental and practical sustainability. Further, the high whiteness and blueness scores indicated that the methods met the requirements of white analytical chemistry by RGB12 and BAGI tools. Thus, these methods offer a practical, eco-conscious solution for simultaneous determination of RDV and MFX in pharmaceutical and clinical settings, contributing to better therapeutic monitoring in COVID-19 management.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the associations between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control measures and infant health in Vietnam are limited. This study investigated differences in birth outcomes between pregnancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and those before the pandemic. Data on infants born alive between 2016 and 2023 in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) were collected. For each infant, the estimated first day of pregnancy was calculated based on birth date and gestational age. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify significant associations. The birth outcomes examined included decreased birth weight (BW), low BW (LBW), term LBW, and preterm birth (PTB). The models were adjusted for infant sex, birth order, gestational age, and maternal age. The COVID-19 pandemic period in HCMC was defined as April 2020 to December 2022. Among 172,017 infants, 31% had at least 1 trimester of gestation during the COVID-19 pandemic, 44.2% were first births, and 52% were male. Infants with full gestation during the pandemic had significantly lower BW (by 20.7 grams) compared to those born pre-pandemic. Pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with higher rates of LBW, term LBW, and PTB compared to the pre-pandemic period. The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.21 (1.15 to 1.27), 1.28 (1.18 to 1.39), and 1.10 (1.06 to 1.15), respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with elevated risk of adverse birth outcomes. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 response should be applied to prepare for future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Although studies have demonstrated a decline in mental health during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term psychological effects remain insufficiently understood. This study conducted a web-based questionnaire survey to identify factors associated with depression among college students in Hokkaido, Japan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 187 participants who responded to a questionnaire administered in April 2022 were included in this study. The survey evaluated depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and included items on exercise habits, sleep duration, food frequency score (FFS), World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), daily step count, part-time job participation, and involvement in club activities. The mean CES-D score was 18.2 (±9.9), with 95 participants (49.7%) exhibiting symptoms of depression. Compared to those in the depression group, participants in the non-depression group were significantly more likely to engage in regular exercise and part-time jobs, as well as higher FFS, WHO-5, and FCV-19S scores. Logistic regression analysis showed that, even after adjusting for confounding variables, the WHO-5 score, FCV-19S score, and participation in part-time jobs remained significantly associated with depression scores. Almost half of the participants showed symptoms of depression. These symptoms were associated with poor exercise habits and lack of part-time employment, among other factors. Among college students who had experienced more than 2 years of the pandemic, engaging in part-time work may have reduced social isolation and helped lower the risk of depression.",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic diseases are increasingly affecting global health, making it crucial to understand viral dynamics in wildlife reservoirs like bats. Bats are well-established coronavirus reservoirs, and their proximity to human habitats in France raises concerns about zoonotic transmission. This study investigates the prevalence, diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in bats from the Camargue and Eastern Provence, two ecologically distinct regions. A total of 785 bat guano samples were collected non-invasively, with 154 (19.6%) testing positive for coronavirus RNA, among the highest infection rates observed in European studies. Camargue samples were entirely from Pipistrellus bats, with a prevalence of 20.1%, while Provence showed greater genus diversity and prevalence ranging from 1.3% to 35.6%. Phylogenetic analysis identified Alphacoronaviruses in four subgenera: Nyctacovirus, Myotacovirus, Decacovirus, and Minunacovirus, alongside unclassified sequences. No coronavirus related to human-infecting strains (e.g., HCoV-229E) was detected. However, the combination of high prevalence, proximity to humans, and potential for host-switching led to the investigation of coronavirus infection in bats, a topic with limited data in France. These findings highlight the ecological role of bats and the importance of continuous viral monitoring, filling a gap in knowledge about coronavirus circulation in European bat populations.",

Political ideology is currently a popular possible explanation for discrepancies among states in pandemic outcomes, given that Republican states tended to have higher death rates compared to Democratic ones. Additionally, partisan politics have been criticized for hindering the US pandemic response, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. However, this study demonstrates that the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) index may serve as a more significant predictor of the death and excess death rates among the US states than political affiliation. This suggests that it was not \"red\" or \"blue,\" but rather \"green\" that was the most important factor in determining COVID-19 mortality. Pandemic lessons are lessons of sustainability.",

    "abstract": "European countries rapidly advised coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination during pregnancy based on the evidence of first and reassuring data, especially with mRNA vaccines. Besides the close European pharmacovigilance monitoring, Luxembourg set up a prospective study cohort of women vaccinated during pregnancy to collect maternal and embryofetal outcomes. The study was conducted between June 2021 and October 2023, based on the national vaccination registry. Women were contacted by email and all reported events were retrospectively reviewed by an expert group. The cohort involved 2335 vaccinated pregnant women of which 476 (20.4%) provided an answer, with 383 (80.5%) reporting no adverse events, 88 (18.5%) reporting a total of 90 adverse events (five reports not assessable). Vaccines were almost exclusively messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. Between the women who reported an adverse event and those who did not, no significant difference was identified for vaccine rank and pregnancy trimester. Among the 90 reported events, 73 (81,9%) were considered as without link with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. Among the 17 adverse events having a non-excluded link with the vaccine, 16 (94%) had a favorable outcome and/or no pathophysiological explanation in regard to the vaccine. Rates of congenital anomalies and miscarriages were reassuringly lower than in the general population. Our Luxembourgish cohort study provided results consistent with other European pharmacovigilance surveys and literature data, in agreement with the overall safety of the vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 with mRNA vaccine during pregnancy.",

    "title": "The management of cryptorchidism in Brazil: An ecological overview.",
    "abstract": "Cryptorchidism refers to the extra-scrotal location of the testicle and is the most common male genital anomaly. Although the recommended age ranges for both hormonal and surgical treatments are well-established, within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), children with cryptorchidism undergo surgery at varying ages across the country. As a time-sensitive procedure, delayed orchidopexy has consequences such as an increased risk of infertility or even testicular cancer. Correlating data on cryptorchidism treatment in SUS with geographic and socioeconomic indicators may help to understand how a population's profile influences the public healthcare system. This study explores the potential relationship between the age at which orchiopexy is performed and the quality of public healthcare services in Brazil while also assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this surgery's backlog. To achieve this, we collected data from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health System (DATASUS) and indicators provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography (IBGE) and the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). We cataloged and compiled the data for comprehensive analysis. Between 2008 and 2022, 94,237 orchiopexies were performed in SUS in patients aged 0-15. Nationwide, this represents only 47.6 % of the expected procedures, ranging from 22.75 % in the North to 68.18 % in the South. The proportion of surgeries performed before age 2 was very low, ranging from 12 % in the North and Northeast to 24 % in the South. Most orchiopexies in Brazil were performed after the age of five. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly worsened this situation, causing a 44.45 % decline in surgeries in 2020 compared to 2019, disproportionately affecting all age groups and exacerbating the backlog of surgeries. Our study indicates that many children with cryptorchidism remain undiagnosed or receive delayed treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic further worsened this scenario, temporarily reducing the number of operations. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive public policies to improve healthcare access and prevent complications associated with untreated cryptorchism.",

Physicians cited low health literacy, poor understanding of discharge instructions, social determinants of health, and medical complexity as major barriers. Staff identified time constraints, medication access, and inter team communication as primary challenges. Patients highlighted complex discharge instructions, COVID-19's impact on support systems, and technology barriers. Healthcare providers and patients identified very different priorities regarding an optimized discharge. Physicians were most concerned with low patient understanding of impeding discharge. Nursing staff identified obtaining medications, inter-team communication, and time constraints as their greatest obstacles. Patients found the impact of COVID-19, lack of support systems, and accessing technology as the most difficult. These findings underscore the need for tailored interventions to improve the discharge process which account for individual stakeholders' priorities to develop a national standardized \"patient-centered\" discharge process for patients with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Urban areas are the major anthropogenic source of atmospheric CO2, thus making long-term and continuous observations of their carbon emission dynamics extremely important. The COVID-19 lockdown served as a natural experiment that provided a unique opportunity to analyse the contribution of human activities to CO2 emissions from urban areas. In 2020, Beijing experienced COVID-19 confinement with different levels of restrictions on social mobility and economic activity, resulting in reductions in CO2 emissions. To investigate the response mechanisms of CO2 flux to restriction measures, we analysed CO2 flux data obtained using the eddy covariance technique from 2015 to 2020, and compared CO2 flux during the COVID-19 confinement period in 2020 with the preceding years (2015-2019) and across various levels of confinement. The results showed that: (1) the annual CO2 flux was 2.1 ± 0.2 kg C/(m2·yr) in 2020, which showed a significant reduction of 31.8 % compared to the adjacent 2019; (2) the reduction in CO2 flux was closely related to the level of restrictions on human activities; (3) most reductions occurred during the morning (85.7 %) and evening (32.7 %) peak traffic times, indicating that commuting-related transportation is a primary contributor to urban CO2 emissions. It is suggested that measures that reduce transportation-related CO2 sources should be considered as priorities for reducing urban CO2 emissions. The dynamic variation of urban CO2 flux captured by the eddy covariance technology is conductive to strengthening the supervision of the implementation of urban carbon emission reduction policies, promoting the achievement of dual carbon goals.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 lockdown was a typical example of extreme emission reduction, providing an opportunity to study the impact of lockdown measures on air pollution. Particle number concentrations (PNC) originate from direct emissions or through new particle formation events. However, their variations during the lockdown period are under investigation. This study focuses on Luohe, a city on the southern edge of the North China Plain, analyzing the changes in PNC and its sources before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. From March 25th to May 31st, 2022, real-time PNC measurements were conducted using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for particle size. Results showed an 11.2 % decrease in PNC during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown and a 3.6 % decrease compared to post-lockdown, indicating reduced local emissions and weakened regional transportation during the lockdown. Positive Matrix Factorization analysis identified six sources contributing to the total PNC, including photochemical nucleation, aged photochemical nucleation, gasoline vehicle emissions, diesel vehicle emissions, coal and biomass combustion, and secondary aerosols. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implementation of lockdown measures (2644.8 #/cm3, 2202.2 #/cm3, 2792.7#/cm3). Concurrently, photochemical nucleation (310.1 #/cm3, 306.3 #/cm3, 393.1 #/cm3) and photochemical nucleation aging (592.8 #/cm3, 744.1 #/cm3, 810.7 #/cm3) exhibited increasing trends, while coal/biomass combustion (1656.6 #/cm3, 1586.2 #/cm3, 980.0 #/cm3) and secondary sources (999.4 #/cm3, 791.1 #/cm3, 804.1 #/cm3) showed decreasing trends. In summary, the contributions of traffic emissions to PNC highlight the potential for targeted traffic management strategies to improve urban air quality.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus spike protein, the key entity effectuating membrane fusion, cannot exist without membrane-active fragments. In addition to fusion peptides, among such domains are HR1 and HR2. Crucial to the spike's refolding and membrane fusion, they are believed to both interact with each other and bind to the membranes that are merged. To elucidate HR2's precise role in this process, an understanding of its structure and behaviour is required. Here, we used various computational approaches to study SARS-CoV-2 spike HR2's (1163-1211) interaction with membranes in the context within which it operates in live spike. During simulations with model bilayers, HR2 remained hugely unresponsive to the presence of a membrane, however, when extended to include the transmembrane domain (TMD) (1212-1234) and/or membrane-active preHR2 fragment (1147-1161), HR2's binding to model bilayers was markedly enhanced. The trimeric coiled-coil of HR2 does not dissociate either on its own or with added TMD and/or preHR2. Molecular hydrophobicity potential (MHP) mapping showed that HR2's central part possesses a tilted oblique-oriented motif characteristic of \"textbook\" membrane-active peptides, albeit flanked by highly hydrophilic fragments. A truncated HR2 only encompassing this motif had a greater affinity for membranes, suggesting HR2 has a modular structure with a membrane-active segment masked by flanking regions and might be potentiated by HR2-adjacent domains and other factors coming into play after the spike gets enzymatically cleaved. Such a modular structure may have evolved for HR2's membrane activity to be regulated very subtly and \"switched on\" at precisely the right moment during viral fusion.",

Patients meeting the inclusion criteria for severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled as the case group, while age- and gender-matched healthy individuals were selected as the control group. Levels of PCT, CRP, and HBP were measured. The case group was further stratified based on bacterial culture results, and differences in serum, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid markers were subjected to statistical analysis. Plasma levels of PCT and HBP were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared to both the COVID-19 group and the healthy control group, while CRP was only significant in distinguishing cases from the healthy control group. The AUC for PCT in differentiating COVID-19 patients from those with bacterial infection was 0.937 with a sensitivity of 0.828 and specificity of 0.933, while the AUC for CRP was 0.564 with a sensitivity of 0.828 and specificity of 0.400. The AUC for HBP was 0.775 with a sensitivity of 0.690 and specificity of 0.967. The combined detection of PCT+CRP+HBP exhibited the highest diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.978, a sensitivity of 0.966, and a specificity of 0.933. The combined detection of PCT, CRP, and HBP can enable more precise classification of COVID-19 patients with concurrent bacterial infections and inform the optimal timing of antibiotic initiation.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to characterize the multimodal imaging findings and clinical features of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) in a series of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients from China. In this observational study, a total of 18 patients (30 eyes) with post-COVID-19 infection presenting as AMN were enrolled between December 2022 and May 2024 and underwent a minimum of 12 months of ophthalmic follow-up. Multimodal imaging features following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were evaluated by infrared (IR) reflectance imaging, ultrawide-field scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography, visual field testing, and fundus fluorescein angiography. Scotomas were present in all 18 patients (30 eyes) at the initial visit. IR reflectance imaging revealed localized areas of hyporeflectivity in the macular region in 5 patients (8 eyes). SD-OCT scans demonstrated hyper-reflective changes within the photoreceptor layer and disruption of its normal laminar architecture in all 18 patients (30 eyes). All cases in this series exhibited signs of classic maculopathy. Notably, these abnormalities persisted for at least 12 months in all affected eyes. These data suggest that AMN is a significant ocular manifestation in patients with COVID-19, characterized by persistent scotomas lasting at least 12 months.",

This study evaluates four direct sample preparation protocols and proposes an economical alternative RNA extraction method using generic silica columns as a feasible solution during resource scarcity. While the non-extraction protocols tested presented an elevated risk of producing false negatives, the alternative method demonstrated results statistically comparable to standard manual and automated extraction protocols (ANOVA, F=0.69, p = 0.415), with an average Ct difference of only one cycle. The protocol demonstrated reduced efficiency only at extreme viral loads and offers a cost-effective, accessible option for public health laboratories facing supply chain constraints during increasingly common epidemic pressures.",

The cofactor nsp8 is an important component of the RTC in both alpha and betacoronaviruses required for nsp12 polymerase activity, complex stability, and recruitment of other RTC cofactors. Here we use NMR and other biophysical methods to characterize the structural features and oligomeric state of full-length nsp8 in solution. We show that the C-terminal domain of nsp8 has molten-globule like intrinsic disorder, while the N-terminal domain retains its folded structure in the absence of binding partners. Our data also shows a concentration-dependent association of nsp8 into dimers and possibly tetramers, but not larger molecular weight species. Upon binding nsp7, the C-terminal domain of nsp8 folds into a well-defined conformation consistent with available structures of the complex, while the linker region connecting the N- and C-terminal domains remains disordered.",

We analyzed 2021 COVID-19 vaccination data from Ontario administrative databases. The social housing population was identified using postal codes of designated social housing buildings. Vaccination rates were compared quarterly across age and sex categories between social housing residents and the general population. In 2021, there were 14,842,488 eligible individuals identified in Ontario administrative health data, with 328,276 individuals residing in social housing. By the end of 2021, 75.45% of adult social housing residents were fully vaccinated (2 or more COVID-19 vaccine doses) compared to 87.46% of the general adult population. This gap persisted over time and across sexes. Over the same period, 30.61% of the children and youth in social housing achieved full vaccination rates compared to 30.21% of the general population, with greater vaccine uptake among females. Despite COVID-19 vaccination policies aimed at prioritizing vulnerable groups in Ontario, Canada, adult social housing residents had lower vaccination rates compared to the general population. Children and youth in social housing achieved relatively higher vaccination coverage. These findings underscore the need for more targeted efforts to improve vaccine accessibility and uptake among adult social housing residents.",

Nulliparous women with term singleton pregnancies in which the fetus was in vertex presentation (NTSV) who underwent non-emergent cesareans (N = 868) and their interprofessional clinical teams, including nurses, certified nurse midwives, attending physicians, and resident physicians. Implementation of a validated, adapted communication tool for use by the clinical team before non-emergent cesareans. We added individual nurse cesarean rates for women with NTSV pregnancies to the existing clinical audit and feedback process. We collected compliance data through chart reviews and an Epic report. Rates of compliance with use of the tool and variation in individual nurse cesarean rates for women with NTSV pregnancies. Compliance with use of the tool averaged 62% and peaked at 77% during active education efforts but declined to 33% after implementation. We noted wide variation in individual nurse cesarean rates for women with NTSV pregnancies (0.00%-45.45%) among nurses who managed 10 or more eligible births over 5 months. We identified positive outliers or nurses who consistently had low cesarean rates. Achieving high compliance with the use of an interprofessional communication tool before non-emergent cesareans requires sustained education and engagement. Integrating the communication tool into existing workflows may enhance its long-term effect. The variability in individual nurse cesarean rates that we found suggests a need for further investigation into nursing practices that support physiological birth and reduce unnecessary cesareans.",

    "abstract": "Viral Infections cause several common human illnesses, like the common cold, flu, mouth blisters, and chickenpox. However, numerous viruses, including rabies, hepatitis, Ebola, avian flu, and coronavirus cause significant health risks due to their high transmission rates. Infections are obligate intracellular parasites that depend on host cellular organisms, resources, and replication for their reproduction and spread. Timely and precise identification of these viruses is vital for appropriate treatment and preventing further spread. However common challenges such as, non-specific symptoms, variability in viral expression, and delayed testing often complicate timely diagnosis. To address this issue, a powerful module named Quantum Dilated Convolutional Recurrent Network (QDCRNet) has been developed for virus detection. Firstly, gene expression data is given into data transformation, and it is done by the Box-Cox transformation. Then, Feature Selection (FS) is performed using Gower distance and mutual information to select the virus-affected region. Finally, detection of the virus is done using QDCRNet, which is the integration of Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) and Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) model. The proposed QDCRNet has achieved a great performance with an accuracy of 90.80 %, sensitivity of 90.50 % and specificity of 90.40 %.",

    "abstract": "The sense of smell perceives odorants via the olfactory circuitry. Sense of smell is essential for multiple species, while its loss in humans (Anosmia) has been described in COVID-19, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, where neuroinflammation is a common denominator. Olfactory circuitry is proximal to the respiratory tract, therefore, is susceptible to foreign particles intromission that trigger neuroinflammation. The brain Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) influence neuroinflammation through its counter-regulatory axes: The pro-inflammatory Renin/(Pro)Renin Receptor ((P)RR) axis and the anti-inflammatory Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7))/Mas Receptor (MasR) axis. Certain phytochemicals with angiotensinergic activity may improve neuroinflammation. Among these, β-Caryophyllene, stands out for its bicyclic sesquiterpenoid structure and its activity toward multiple targets, including the Cannabinoid Receptor 2 and the peripheral ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis. It is still unknown whether β-Caryophyllene affects the brain RAS, especially in vulnerable regions to neuroinflammation, like the olfactory circuitry. This study aims to explore the angiotensinergic effect of β-Caryophyllene on anosmia and the neuroinflammation of the olfactory circuitry. Male BALB/c mice were intranasally administered with lipopolysaccharide and orally treated with β-Caryophyllene for seven days. Multiple parameters concerning RAS, olfaction, neuroinflammation, cell death and stress were evaluated. Results demonstrate that β-Caryophyllene improved anosmia, increased ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) levels, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reduced corticosterone levels and cell death. Molecular docking showed favorable interactions between β-Caryophyllene and ACE2. Therefore, β-Caryophyllene could be useful against anosmia and neuroinflammation due to the possible regulation of the RAS.",

Herein, we have developed a diagnostic platform for several respiratory viruses by integrating surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals from three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic nanopillar substrates with interpretability-driven deep learning. The 3D plasmonic nanopillar array enables robust and reproducible capture of viral components, enhancing the SERS signal for virus-specific molecular fingerprinting. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) has been trained on SERS spectra from 13 respiratory virus types, including SARS-CoV-2 variants and sublineages, achieving over 98 % classification accuracy. To further improve model transparency, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) has been applied, revealing consistent Raman shift regions critical for virus discrimination across various media conditions. The platform has demonstrated reliable performance even in complex clinical samples, confirming its applicability for real-world diagnostics. The present approach offers a scalable and label-free solution for rapid virus detection, with potential for point-of-care applications and epidemiological surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based nucleic acid detection has advanced rapidly due to its simplicity, high specificity, and high sensitivity. However, most conventional CRISPR-based detection methods lack quantitative capability. Although the strategy of digital PCR technology enhances the sensitivity of CRISPR detection and enables quantification analysis through sample dispersion, integration remains limited. In this study, we developed a one-pot digital recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)/CRISPR nucleic acid detection platform by integrating RPA-assisted CRISPR nucleic acid detection with droplet microfluidics. A microfluidic chip was designed to integrate nucleic acid extraction, reagent mixing, droplet generation and collection, and on-chip isothermal reaction. The one-pot RPA/CRISPR reaction system and droplet preparation conditions were systematically optimized. In addition, a portable smartphone-based temperature control and fluorescence imaging device was developed to enable convenient \"sample-to-answer\" nucleic acid quantification with high sensitivity. This platform allows digital quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 samples within 50 min, achieving a detection limit as low as 1 copy/μL, with results comparable to commercial instruments. By integrating the immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST)-based nucleic acid extraction with droplet digital RPA/CRISPR and utilizing smartphones and cloud processing for real-time result analysis, this study offers a novel \"sample-to-answer\" and highly sensitive nucleic acid quantification solution for point-of-care testing (POCT).",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of bivalent vaccines targeting both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and Omicron subvariants, vaccination rates remain low in South Korea. This study aims to evaluate the neutralizing activity against Omicron subvariants following the third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients undergoing chemotherapy, as well as to assess the need for additional vaccinations. Between April and November 2022, the authors assessed the neutralizing activity of the third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in 63 patients undergoing chemotherapy using an ELISA-based surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT). The authors examined the influence of factors such as prior COVID-19 infection, cancer type (solid vs. hematologic malignancy), type of chemotherapy regimen (cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors), and vaccine type (homologous vector, homologous mRNA, heterologous) on neutralizing activity. Among the 57 patients included in the analysis, 26 (45.6 %) had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with hematologic cancers exhibited lower neutralizing antibody responses compared to those with solid tumors for Omicron subvariants BA.1 (24.44 % vs. 71.68 %, p = 0.020), BA.2 (48.22 % vs. 94.59 %, p = 0.006), and BA.4/5 (24.76 % vs. 78.06 %, p = 0.046). Among uninfected patients (n = 31), sVNT inhibition scores were significantly lower across all subvariants (e.g., 5.89 % for BA.1 vs. 58.11 % in infected, p = 0.0025). Treatment delays due to infection were observed in 9 patients (17.75 days on average). Although no deaths were directly attributed to infection, one patient died due to disease progression following a treatment delay caused by the infection. Patients undergoing chemotherapy displayed weak neutralizing responses against Omicron subvariants, especially those with hematologic cancers or no prior infection. Consequently, it is crucial to actively recommend additional vaccinations with bivalent or newly developed vaccines for these vulnerable patients.",

Healthcare workers (HCWs) were uniquely positioned at the intersection of clinical care and public communication. This scoping review aims to map and synthesise the existing literature on HCWs' experiences and engagement with Covid-19-related misinformation, identifying recurring themes across qualitative and quantitative studies. A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Four scientific databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library) were searched for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 31 August 2024, yielding 55 eligible publications that included surveys and interviews with HCWs, employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The analysis focused on identifying common themes related to HCWs' experiences with misinformation. Five key themes emerged: (1) belief in misinformation, shaped by trust and uncertainty; (2) frustration with inconsistent and overwhelming official communication; (3) strained patient-provider relationships due to eroded trust; (4) social media as both a source of misinformation and professional support; and (5) mental health impacts, including anxiety and exhaustion. The review highlights the significant burden that Covid-19 misinformation placed on HCWs, contributing to professional dissatisfaction, strained patient relationships, and emotional distress. Despite their lower susceptibility to misinformation, HCWs expressed a need for reliable information channels and training to manage misinformation in clinical interactions. To enhance pandemic preparedness, targeted infodemic management training for HCWs is crucial, focusing on misinformation detection, effective communication strategies, and patient education. Strengthening public health communication efforts can help alleviate the burden on HCWs by reducing the spread of misinformation, thereby supporting their well-being and professional efficacy during future public health crises.",

This study analyzes TikTok data related to mpox using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. This paper aims to extract key topics and inform targeted health promotion strategies for mpox prevention and control. Using the \"Aisou Jisou\" system, we collected TikTok data containing the keyword \"Mpox\" from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2025. The dataset comprised 25,672 text data and associated search terms. We analyzed trends in the Search Index and Target Group Index (TGI) across time, gender, age groups, and provinces. LDA topic modeling was applied to identify latent topics within the text data, and topic evolution was examined during 4 peak months of the Search Index. A total of 4 major Search Index peaks were identified on TikTok in China, which are May 2022, July 2023, August 2024, and February 2025. These peaks aligned with key global and national mpox events, including WHO's declaration of a global mpox outbreak in May 2022 and the detection of the clade Ib Mpox in China in January 2025. TGI analysis revealed that users aged 18-23 years exhibited the highest engagement. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin, and Jilin recorded the highest cumulative TGI values (5922.38, 5692.41, and 3579.90, respectively). LDA topic modeling identified 8 primary topics, including transmission and prevention, vaccine concerns, and misinformation, etc. Public attention evolved from general disease knowledge toward issues of stigmatization and vaccine distrust over time. Sankey diagrams illustrated shifts in public attention across topics at different Search Index peaks, with \"Mpox Transmission and Prevention\" receiving the most attention in May 2022 and \"Mpox Vaccination and Infection Prevention\" in February 2025. TikTok provides real-time insights into public attention during mpox outbreaks, but can also propagate misinformation and stigmatizing narratives. Public health authorities should leverage these platforms for timely communication, actively address misinformation, and mitigate social bias. Tailored strategies are needed to enhance health literacy, minimize stigma, and strengthen outbreak preparedness and response. This study highlights the dual role of social media as both an information source and a potential vector for misinformation, emphasizing the necessity for active monitoring and regulation by health authorities to ensure the accuracy and reliability of disseminated health information.",

We evaluated the influence of mindfulness and coping flexibility in the early days of burnout development in a prospective study of 50 military caregivers working in a mobile resuscitation unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. We visited the participants at the end of deployment (day 0; D0) and three weeks later (D21). On D0, the participants completed questionnaires assessing mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory; FMI), coping flexibility (Flexcop), and burnout (Burnout Measure, Short Version; BMS). Subjective sleep symptoms were also assessed to evaluate their relationship with burnout. The BMS was repeated on D21. Four short-term burnout evolutions were observed: (i) \"healthy\" on D0 and D21; (ii) \"exhausted,\" healthy on D0 and burnout on D21; (iii) \"resilient,\" burnout on D0 and healthy on D21; and (iv) \"burnout\" on D0 and D21.

Exhausted participants had more difficulty waking, and burnout participants had higher daytime fatigue than healthy participants. FMI scores on D0 negatively correlated with BMS scores on D21 (r = ‒0.40 r2 = 0.16 p = 0.009) for the entire population, and also after excluding burnout status at D0 (r = ‒0.41 r2 = 0.17 p = 0.02). Flexcop scores on D0 did not correlate with BMS scores on D21. This study underlines the importance of mindfulness in the early days of burnout onset, and suggests considering its reinforcement for prevention of burnout and its measurement as a potential biomarker of burnout risk.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and may contribute to poor clinical outcomes when co-detected in COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of pneumococcal positivity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at two tertiary care centers. Pneumococcal positivity was defined by either a positive urinary antigen test or multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Disease severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 scoring systems. Propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to adjust for confounders and identify independent risk factors for mortality. Among 280 patients, 65 pneumococcus-positive patients were matched with 65 pneumococcus-negative patients after propensity score matching. In the overall matched cohort, pneumococcal positivity was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. However, in patients with severe disease (n = 156), defined as pneumonia severity index >130 or CURB-65 ≥ 3, mortality was significantly higher in pneumococcus-positive patients (n = 39) than in pneumococcus-negative patients (53.8% vs. 29.1%, p = 0.009).

This study aimed to investigate predictors of COVID-19 testing and disclosure hesitancy, with a focus on the role of responsibility attribution during the early stages of the Omicron epidemic in South Korea. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1,000 participants between February 25 and March 2, 2022. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression models were used for analysis. Findings showed that 41.5% of participants expressed hesitancy toward COVID-19 testing, and 59.4% expressed hesitancy toward disclosing test results to contacts. Greater attribution of responsibility to individuals was significantly associated with increased hesitancy toward testing (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.90, p < 0.001) and disclosure (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.80, p < 0.001). Conversely, testing acceptance was positively associated with trust in the government (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07-1.55, p = 0.01), social support (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.73-2.73, p < 0.001), and full vaccination status (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.11-3.50, p = 0.02).

These results underscore the central role of responsibility attribution in shaping public participation in surveillance efforts. Mitigating excessive individual attribution and fostering a balanced perspective that integrates both personal and contextual factors may enhance public engagement. While attribution remains a key psychological predictor, building trust in government and strengthening social support systems also emerge as important strategies for promoting active and voluntary participation in public health surveillance.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, community participation was expressed by participants as a compliance measure with guidelines, helping to create awareness, and providing support (food, sanitizers, money, etc.) to fellow citizens. These experiences were related to CS and valued for personal achievement, satisfaction, and happiness with a chance to build social capital. Some participants expressed lack of confidence and language barriers as notable concerns while sharing their opinions with stakeholders (policymakers and researchers). Sustainability of CS activities was associated with creation of an organizations or networks, securing budget, incentivise participation, and assisting transportation. Participants considered CS as a community participation mechanism as a potentially viable and efficient manage future pandemics and public health crises.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to improve mental health of hospital workers: The SEEGEN multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Hospital workers are at high risk for stress-related mental health issues and are considered a vulnerable workforce in most Western countries. Although multilevel interventions that address individual and organizational factors show promise, there is limited robust evidence of their effectiveness in hospital settings. This study evaluated the SEEGEN trial, a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in the German healthcare sector, to assess the effectiveness of a structured multilevel intervention designed to reduce psychosocial stress and to promote mental well-being among hospital employees. The intervention included five modules that targeted different hierarchical levels, sources of interpersonal and structural stress, and potentially vulnerable life stages. These modules were: (i) top management training, (ii) dilemma management - coping by taking responsibility, (iii) promoting stress-preventive relational leadership competence, (iv) reconciling work and family life, and (v) staying healthy at work. The study was conducted at three clinical centers in Germany and included 18 clusters with a total of N = 415 participants. The clusters were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a wait-list control group. The primary outcome was psychological strain (Irritation Scale; IRR), and the secondary outcomes were mental well-being (WHO-5) and perceived psychosocial safety climate, (PSC-12). Intervention effects were estimated using a two-level linear analysis of covariance. Changes from baseline to the 11-month follow-up were analyzed. The intervention had no statistically significant effect on the primary or secondary outcomes. The lack of significant effects may be attributed to low participation rates, an insufficient intervention dosage, and contextual factors, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and staffing shortages in the participating hospitals. Although the intervention cannot currently be recommended for widespread implementation, the study provides valuable insights into developing, delivering, and overcoming the challenges of multilevel workplace interventions in healthcare settings.",

    "title": "Epidemiology of liver cancer in Kazakhstan: data from the Unified National Electronic Health System, 2014-2023.",
    "abstract": "Liver cancer is the third-deadliest cancer globally, significantly affecting the Asian population, which accounts for 70% of cases. Despite these numbers, the burden of liver cancer in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, remains underexplored. This paper reviews the epidemiology of liver cancer in Kazakhstan by analyzing large-scale administrative data from the national registry. The study cohort included 10,455 patients diagnosed with liver neoplasms (C22.0-C22.9, D13.4) from 2014 to 2023, using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Age-standardized incidence, mortality, and prevalence rates per 100,000 population were calculated. Cox regression analysis estimated hazard ratios across social-demographic and medical predictors. Over the decade, age-standardized incidence rates decreased from 5.55 to 5.40 per 100,000, while mortality rates rose from 3.75 to 4.75 per 100,000. A downward trend appeared between 2017-2019 but gradually reversed post-2020. Prevalence rates steadily increased from 1.30 to 7.32 per 100,000. The cohort's mean age was 63.2 ± 0.1 years, with most cases diagnosed as stage III hepatocellular carcinoma. West Kazakhstan, East Kazakhstan, and Pavlodar were the most burdened regions. Liver cirrhosis history predicted worse survival (Hazard Ratio, HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.06-1.22), while primary hypertension showed a protective effect (HR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.78-0.86). Liver cancer morbidity and mortality rates have risen in Kazakhstan over the past decade, with a slight decrease during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are mostly diagnosed with stage III hepatocellular carcinoma. West Kazakhstan, East Kazakhstan, and Pavlodar are the most affected regions, requiring better management of high-risk groups. Poor survival was linked to liver cirrhosis. Further research on the role of rising metabolic liver diseases and treatment options in Kazakhstan is needed to better predict liver cancer prognosis.",

    "title": "Evaluating the MT-CYB and MT-ATP6 variations in COVID-19 patients: A case-control study.",
    "abstract": "The complications and lingering effects of COVID-19 have caused a global health crisis, prompting intense investigations into the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease. The majority of symptoms associated with this infectious disease are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, and recent studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can impair host mitochondrial function. This study aims to investigate mutations in the MT-CYB and MT-ATP6 genes of mtDNA in COVID-19 patients and their association with disease outcomes. Out of 110 individuals enrolled, 30 were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the remaining 80 were healthy. Following DNA isolation from the blood samples, the MT-CYB and MT-ATP6 genes were amplified through PCR, purified, and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. In the MT-CYB gene, 9 distinct mutations were found. Among these, novel mutation m.14942A > C was more prevalent in COVID-19-positive individuals than COVID-19 negative controls (p = 0.012 < 0.05) and exhibited a significant correlation with the disease as OR (95% CI) = 19.75 (2.264-172.246). According to in-silico analyses, this mutation is deemed deleterious and decreases the stability of the CYB protein. In case of the MT-ATP6 gene, among the identified 8 mutations, the m.8744T > G mutation was higher in COVID-19-positive individuals than healthy controls (p = 0.009 < 0.05) and showed a significant correlation with the disease: OR (95% CI) = 24.04 (2.81-205.62). According to in-silico analyses, this mutation is found to be pathogenic and reduces the stability of the ATP6 protein. In conclusion, one novel mtDNA mutation was identified in this study, and some of the mutations identified in the MT-CYB as well as MT-ATP6 genes, including the novel mutation, are relatively common in the COVID-19 patient group. Moreover, the findings demonstrated that these mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of public health efforts and vaccination campaigns depends on the level of trust that the population has, which in turn depends on the population's confidence in health information sources and organizations. This study aims to assess post-pandemic compliance with vaccine information sources and their influence on future pandemic preparedness in Iran and to identify the underlying factors related to adherence. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire among Iranian adults in 2024. The instrument used in this study was rooted in the Health Belief Model and the 3 C Model of Vaccine Hesitancy, and was developed according to previous literature, objectives of the study, and inputs from experts in this field. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire were further evaluated using face, content and construct validity, and Cronbach's alpha. We applied multiple linear regression to identify independent predictors of compliance with national and international vaccination guidelines and future pandemic preparedness. Among 457 Iranian adults who participated in our study, approximately 75% reported favorable attitudes toward adherence to vaccination guidelines and pandemic preparedness. Mean adherence scores were higher for international (4.06 ± 0.76) than for national (3.81 ± 0.81) vaccination guidelines. Multiple linear regression revealed that trust in health authorities, favorable vaccine perceptions, and self-efficacy were the strongest predictors of adherence to both national and international vaccination guidelines. Notably, trust in national health authorities was negatively associated with adherence to international vaccination guidelines (B: -0.137, 95% CI: -0.198 -0.076). In addition, individuals with a personal or family history of COVID-19 scored significantly higher in adherence to international vaccination guidelines by an average of 0.31 points (95% CI: 0.11-0.51). Enhancing vaccine perceptions, trust in health organizations, and self-efficacy improves public compliance and pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Given the recent redefinition of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and the clinical demand for non-invasive tools, this study evaluated the effect of body position (e.g., supine, left lateral recumbent) and respiratory status (e.g., deep inspiration, expiration) on ultrasound-derived fat fraction (UDFF) measurements., assessed their reliability and consistency, and determined the optimal conditions for obtaining UDFF. A retrospective analysis was performed using the system with the UDFF algorithm. Two operators performed UDFF measurements in six different scenarios, each consisting of three measurements (18 in total). Consistency analysis was achieved primarily by intragroup correlation coefficients (ICC) and Friedman’s test, and Spearman’s correlation analysis mainly achieved correlation. 319 participants were included (mean age 40 ± 17 years; 154 males). The ICC showed strong reliability (mean ICC = 0.999), and Friedman’s test showed no significant differences between BMI groups or between the various breathing and postural conditions (p > 0.05). However, the coefficient of variation (Cov), which affects the results, was lowest for supine breath-holding. Spearman’s ρ showed a strong correlation between supine breath-holding (ρ = 0.973) and end-inspiratory and end-expiratory breathing (ρ = 0.965). Body mass index was also closely and positively correlated with UDFF (ρ = 0.652; p < 0.001), and highly correlated across positions and respiratory states (ρ = 0.954–0.973; p < 0.001). UDFF demonstrates high reliability and consistency, particularly in the supine breath-hold state, offering a standardized protocol for patients with limited mobility or respiratory distress, such as those with COPD or pediatric populations. In addition, the supine breath-hold state may be a more appropriate measurement condition.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to food safety practices globally, profoundly affecting the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of both food handlers and consumers. This study aimed to investigate food safety knowledge and practices of food handlers in the context of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jigjiga during the pandemic. A total of 384 food handlers were surveyed using a structured questionnaire and an observational checklist. The questionnaire assessed knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, and prevention measures, and the checklist evaluated food safety practices and the implementation of COVID-19 prevention measures in food businesses. Categorical variables (eg, sufficient vs insufficient COVID-19 knowledge and good vs poor food-safety practice) were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Pearson chi-square test was used to assess differences in these binary outcomes across demographic and other categorical subgroups (eg, sex, age category, education level, and source of COVID-19 information). A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 384 food handlers were approached, and all responded (response rate=100%). The majority of participants (276/384, 71.9%) had received food hygiene training, and the main source of COVID-19 information was government news media (170/384, 44.3%). The majority of respondents (264/384, 68.8%) correctly identified the key COVID‑19 symptoms, and 52.1% (200/384) accurately understood that respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes drive transmission. However, less than 50% of participants consistently practiced preventive measures such as avoiding handshaking, frequently sanitizing food contact surfaces, and reminding customers to follow physical distancing. Participants who obtained information from government sites and the media had sufficient knowledge compared to other participants (P=.07). Females (P=.03), younger adults (P=.03), married individuals (P=.04), those with secondary education (P=.014), and those who had received previous food safety training (P=.004) demonstrated better food handling practices than their counterparts. Furthermore, 61.4% (236/384) of food businesses had handwashing facilities at the entrance, 70.2% (270/384) implemented crowd control measures, and 56.1% (215/384) used floor markings to facilitate physical distancing. However, only 57.7% (221/384) of food establishments routinely cleaned and disinfected their work surfaces and touch points. These findings highlight the need for targeted education and training interventions to improve food handlers' knowledge and practices, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The city received 3,328 CoronaVac, 1,685 AstraZeneca, and 174 Pfizer-BioNTech doses (5,187 in total). Vaccination with the first dose occurred from January 20, 2021 to April 1, 2022. This study analyzed hospitalized patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and deaths from COVID-19 in Guaramiranga from March 2020 to December 2022. In total, nine cases required hospitalization, seven of which resulted in death. Patients' median age at death equaled 87 (64-95) years. Only one was male, and five had incomplete vaccination schedules before their hospitalization. Hypertension and diabetes configured the most frequent comorbidities, whereas common symptoms at admission included fever (four cases), cough (four cases), and dyspnea (five cases). Of these nine patients, 4 received anticoagulants and corticosteroids; 6, oxygen supplementation; 2, oseltamivir; and 3, empirical antibiotic for pneumonia. The mean interval between the last vaccine dose and hospitalization totaled 128 days (28-326; SD 137). These findings highlight incomplete vaccination, a prolonged interval since last doses, comorbidities, and advanced age as key factors associated with severe cases and deaths and emphasize the protective role of high vaccination coverage.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting confinement at home may have affected physical health and mental well-being especially among vulnerable young people, widening health disparities. Therefore, the aim of the EPaSS-ISS study was to study the changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours among 8-9 years old Italian students during the pandemic of COVID-19 compared with before the pandemic. Data were collected using a web questionnaire. The target population was parents of children attending third-grade primary schools and living in Italy. A cluster sample design was used. Logistic regression models were used to explore changes between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in children's studying hours, active play and screen time. The possible effects of gender, geographical area of residence, parents' nationality and educational level, family structure, family-perceived wealth, availability of home outdoor spaces and house size were investigated. A stratification by sociodemographic characteristics of children and parents was also included in the analysis. 4863 children were included: 47.9% were females, the average age was 8 years and 9 months (SD ± 5 months). The parents reported that 44.3% of their children increased the time spent studying at home, 52.7% the screen time for non-educational purposes on weekdays, and 47.3% at weekends; 44% of the children decreased their time spent playing actively outside school hours on weekdays and 39.3% at weekends. A larger increase of sedentary lifestyle was found among children with at least one parent with a medium (OR:2.57; 95%CI:1.78-3.72) or high educational level (OR:3.32, 95%CI:2.29-4.82), with low family-perceived wealth (OR:1.21; 95%CI:1.03-1.41), with both Italian parents (OR:1.44; 95%CI:1.10-1.90), resident in Centre (OR:1.25; 95%CI:1.04-1.50) or South (OR:1.26; 95%CI:1.05-1.51) Italy. No outdoor spaces (OR:2.14; 95%CI:1.82-2.51) and home size < = 90m2 (OR:1.41; 95%CI:1.05-1.68) had also a negative effect on children's behaviours. In Italy physical activity decreased and sedentary behaviours increased among 8-9 years old children during the COVID 19 pandemic.",

The purpose of this exploratory descriptive analysis was to characterize the differences and commonalities between types of nurse leaders and their experiences of perceived organizational effectiveness, moral injury, and moral resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a quantitative study conducted via an online, national, cross-sectional survey. The survey included sociodemographic and professional practice questions, validated instruments measuring organizational effectiveness, moral injury, and moral resilience. Open-ended questions allowed participants to expand on topics of particular interest. Quantitative data were analyzed using ANCOVA models, qualitative data accompanies the quantitative results for descriptive elaboration. In total, 763 nurse leaders were included in the analysis. Executives scored higher on overall organizational effectiveness than other leaders but not nurse managers. Examining the differences in specific facets of organizational effectiveness revealed that nurse managers rated several aspects of staffing lower than executives. One-third of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant levels of moral injury (score ≥ 36). No significant differences were found between nurse leader roles on moral injury. ANCOVAs indicated that nurse executives had higher total moral resilience than either nurse managers (p = 0.030) or other leaders (p < 0.001). In the open-ended questions, nurse leaders discussed two additional facets of organizational effectiveness that affected moral injury and moral resilience: (1) inequity between healthcare workers in different roles, and (2) an imbalance between organizational finances and patient safety. Organizations can promote retention and moral resilience among nurse leaders by cultivating trustworthy behaviors. This may be achieved through authentic communication and transparency, and by promoting the values reflected in the nursing code of ethics. Not applicable.",

A total of 31 healthy controls and 154 infected patients were enrolled, from which 13 matched controls and 38 infected nasal swab samples were analyzed using miRNA sequencing, followed by qRT-PCR validation. Among the 1788 miRNAs detected, 14 differentially expressed miRNAs and four novel miRNAs were identified, with novel-miR-264-5p showing a ≥ 2-fold change. Correlation with clinical markers highlighted several miRNAs as potential prognostic biomarkers. Seven miRNAs, including miR-146b-3p, miR-154-5p, miR-5010-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-335-3p, miR-30c-5p, and miR-202-5p, showed strong prognostic potential. Combined ROC analysis demonstrated that a panel of top-performing miRNAs significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.939-0.972; p < 0.0001). Moreover, integrating miRNA biomarkers with clinical parameters further improved performance (AUC = 0.982; p < 0.0001). miR-146b-3p, detected exclusively in infected patients, emerged as a highly specific biomarker. Several nasal miRNAs mirrored blood profiles, highlighting the utility of nasal swabs for non-invasive monitoring. Collectively, these findings suggest that miRNA-based biomarkers, alone or combined with clinical markers, offer a promising platform for COVID-19 prognosis and diagnosis, and lay groundwork for future miRNA-based antiviral strategies.",

However, little is known about the diversity of profiles within oncology settings where immunocompromised patients are at high risk. This study aimed to identify distinct clusters of vaccine-related attitudes among Italian nurses working in comprehensive cancer centers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to September 2024, using validated instruments to assess decision regret and vaccine hesitancy (i.e., trust in vaccine efficacy, concerns about vaccine safety, and trust in health authorities and compliance). Data were collected from 241 RNs affiliated with the Italian Association of Cancer Nurses. A t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was used for dimensionality reduction before hierarchical clustering. Seven distinct profiles emerged, ranging from Confident Adherent (low regret, high trust, high compliance) to Resigned Skeptic (low trust, moderate concern, low compliance). Educational status and age significantly influenced cluster membership. Specific profiles displayed unexpected patterns (e.g., high trust with high regret, as in the Regretful Believer group), highlighting the complexity of vaccination attitudes. These findings underscore the importance of person-centered strategies for vaccine communication.

    "abstract": "Increasing life expectancy will lead to more people living with dementia (PLwD) and, consequently, more caregivers experiencing burden. Caregivers burden is influenced by characteristics of both PLwD and caregivers themselves, as well as healthcare services organisation. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures implemented in Italy worsened PLwD and their caregivers' well-being. Recognising the importance of understanding the profiles and care needs of PLwD and their caregivers, a national survey was conducted within the Italian Fund for Alzheimer's and Dementias to investigate the sociodemographic characteristics of PLwD caregivers and their care recipients in Italy. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of Italian caregivers of PLwD, their use of services, and satisfaction with the latter. A cross-sectional national survey was conducted. A self-administered questionnaire was developed consisting mainly of multiple-choice questions. A total of 2369 caregivers participated in the survey. Most of them resided in Northern Italy (60.1%), were females (73.4%) and care recipients' children (74.1%). Median diagnostic delay ranged from 7 to 36 months. Diagnosis was formulated mainly by a physician from a Centre for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia. Caregiver training was poorly reported (34.1%). PLwD clinical condition worsened during the pandemic. The mean degree of satisfaction with services dedicated to dementia was \"acceptable\". Negative/very negative degree of satisfaction was associated with not living in the North, increased caregiver's age, not having received training, severe degree of disease, having received the diagnosis suspicion from a private doctor, and not having used day care centres or Centres for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia. Differences in the sociodemographic profile of caregivers and disparity in services across Italy emerged. The establishment of a comprehensive, accessible, and well-integrated network of services across all stages of the disease progression is needed.",

    "abstract": "A fully portable device featuring electricity-free heating was developed for conducting loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP), enabling rapid nucleic acid detection in resource-limited settings. The system utilizes a chemical heating module powered by the exothermic reaction between calcium oxide (CaO) and water, in conjunction with a palmitic acid-based phase-change material (PCM) that maintains a stable reaction temperature within the optimal DNA amplification range of 60°C-65 °C. DNA amplification is monitored in real time via SYTO-9 fluorescence using a compact optical detection module consisting of a low-power blue light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodiode. Analytical performance of the system was evaluated using human genomic DNA (BRCA1) and synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA as model targets. The device exhibited excellent linearity in SYTO-9 fluorescence detection (R2 = 0.989-0.993) and a lower limit of detection (LOD; 0.010-0.026 μM) compared to a commercial microplate reader (R2 = 0.981, LOD = 0.061 μM). For RT-LAMP assays, the device achieved an LOD of 1.025 copies/reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Specificity testing confirmed the absence of false-positive signals from saliva or non-target RNA samples. Owing to its compact size, electricity-free thermal control, and high analytical sensitivity, the developed device offers a promising platform for point-of-care diagnostics, especially in emergency response and off-grid environments.",

    "abstract": "Blocking the membrane fusion function mediated by the S2 subunit 6-helix bundle (6-HB) structure is an effective strategy for treating coronavirus infections. However, the 6-HB structure of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted drugs. In this study, we predicted the 6-HB structure of IBV via in silico and designed an antiviral peptide HR2P based on this structure. This peptide, derived from a conserved HR2 domain identified via amino acid sequence alignment of 511 IBV strains, disrupted IBV-mediated intercellular membrane fusion. The inhibition results demonstrated that HR2P had broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against different IBV strains representing four dominant genotypes in vitro, reducing viral proliferation and replication by 100- to 1000-fold. Notably, the most potent suppression was observed against the IBV Sczy3 strain of the predominant GI-19 genotype. Meanwhile, in vivo treatment with HR2P effectively mitigated IBV infection and reduced horizontal transmission capacity, as evidenced by reduced morbidity and mortality in IBV-infected chickens and alleviated tracheal and kidney damage. Early administration of HR2P showed superior suppression efficacy. Therefore, the HR2P peptide demonstrates potential as a targeted therapeutic agent against IBV, offering a foundation for IBV prevention strategies.",

    "title": "A Scoping Review on the Ethics of Wastewater Surveillance for COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "Wastewater surveillance (WWS) emerged as a tool to monitor public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wastewater surveillance is generally undertaken voluntarily by public health and wastewater treatment agencies. Therefore, public trust and support is essential to its sustainability. Development and implementation of ethically informed practices may contribute to public support for expansion of WWS to other public health applications. We conducted a scoping review of existing publications on the ethics of WWS for COVID-19. We characterized these publications and identified research gaps. This scoping review was based on searches through Scopus and PubMed for the period January 2020 to December 2023 focusing on four concepts: wastewater, surveillance, ethics, and COVID-19. We included studies published in journals, reports, and books and identified 31 publications. Publications were coded thematically as well as by approach, region, discipline, and publication type. The majority of publications focused on the need to develop ethical guidelines that promote long-term public support for WWS. A number of publications proposed ethical guidelines and also emphasized that these considerations are context-specific and dynamic, requiring an ongoing system for input as new situations, endpoints, and technologies evolve. Themes included protection of privacy, potential to stigmatize communities with high COVID-19 signals, the importance of effective communication, equitable application of WWS, community engagement, and high standards for data quality. There were few empirical studies of diverse populations' preferences for WWS. Ethical considerations may vary across communities and countries and as new applications of wastewater surveillance emerge. We provide an overview of the emerging principles for ethical practice of WWS and identify gaps in knowledge. These findings may guide future research and consideration of ethics as decisionmakers consider new monitoring endpoints (eg, pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs, infectious diseases, and indicators of population health).",

    "abstract": "The Equity Mapping Tool (EMT), a set of integrated tools providing rapid up-to-date COVID-19 data was previously developed for local health departments and health care systems in Franklin County, Ohio, to guide decisions about mobile vaccination. We aimed to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT to 12 Pathway Community HUBs (HUBs) in Ohio, connecting at-risk individuals to health and social services across 61 counties. This was an innovation demonstration project in HUBs to increase community resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the project goals was to provide Community Health Workers (CHWs) working with HUBs with local data for local decisions to advance the health of all Ohioans by engaging, extending, and enhancing the EMT. We used a continuous improvement process called the Engagement, Analytics, Translation (EAT) Framework to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT for HUBs. Engagement activities consisted of focus groups with HUB staff and consultation with CHW Advisory Council, facilitated the co-creation of EMT tools for HUBs and their subsequent enhancement. These activities guided analytics tasks by identifying data requirements, curation, and guiding the development of reports and dashboard for the extended EMT. In translation phase, EMT products were disseminated to HUBs, whose feedback during subsequent engagement activities guided further analytical workflows to enhance EMT. Engagement activities resulted in the identification of shared goals. Public health data needs of HUBs were centered around their populations served, health disparities of focus, and services provided. The capacity to access the EMT interactive dashboard and PDF reports was extended to all 12 HUBs. The collaboration between academic, public health, and community health partners was critical to extending and enhancing the EMT to HUBs. Cycles of EAT helped to be responsive to HUBs' need for data and build their capacity for improving community resiliency.",

Multicenter COVID-19 cohort study was conducted between January 2020 and May 2023. Demographics, chronic underlying diseases, symptoms and signs, analytical and radiological variables, cytokines, and neutralizing antibodies were evaluated on admission. RNAemia was the primary endpoint. We included 1011 patients, 392 (38.8%) immunocompromised and 619 (61.2%) immunocompetent. RNAemia occurred in 49.7% and 18.7% (p < 0.001), respectively, being independently associated with 30-day all-cause mortality. In immunocompromised patients, factors independently associated with RNAemia were Alpha and Omicron VOC periods (OR: 1.95 [1.01-3.79]), pneumonia (OR: 1.96 [1.10-3.50]), LDH > 300 UI/L (OR: 1.64 [1.02-2.63]) and neutralizing antibodies absence (OR: 2.51 [1.57-4.00]). In immunocompetent patients, the factors associated with RNAemia were Delta and Omicron VOC periods (OR: 2.27 [1.46-3.52]), lymphocyte count < 1000/µL (OR: 1.81 [1.16-2.80]) and LDH levels > 300 IU/L (OR: 3.99 [2.51-6.36]).

    "abstract": "The mental health and wellbeing of nurses has been a concern, long before the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Working on the frontline under such challenging circumstances, for extended periods of time, has resulted in negative psychological responses. The current study aims to examine redeployed nurses' resilience in acute hospitals in Ireland, during a period of adversity (pandemic). The impact on their personal and professional identity, and their perception of meaningful supports and coping will be explored. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out to gain insight into how nurses adapted to the changing work environment during the pandemic. Online semi-structured interviews were carried out with six experienced female nurses, who were redeployed to the frontline from their own roles. Three experiential themes representing the nurses' journey were generated: Protection of Sacrificial Self; The Fortifying Effect of Us, and Critical Turning Points & Growth. Nurses made significant sacrifices and had to find ways to detach to cope. They revitalized themselves by creating a sense of 'us' to help them face a harsh climate against others, which enabled critical turning points and growth. This study has strongly highlighted the emotional effects on nurses due to feeling isolated, undervalued, and excluded during redeployment to the frontline. It has also featured how well redeployed nurses coped while faced with an existential crisis. It has given voice to all nurses who faced this pandemic, despite exposure to a risk of burnout and threats to their mental health and wellbeing. This study has further enriched our understanding of personal growth and trauma in adverse work conditions by including an exploration of what sacrificial commitment adds to our understanding of physical and moral courage. Future provision of supports for nurses must be ongoing both during and after crisis events.",

    "abstract": "There is a high prevalence of mental health difficulties among students in higher education. Barriers to seeking mental health support are well documented in this population. However, there is very little research on students' experiences of accessing mental health support services in Ireland. This study aims to: 1) explore students' experiences of accessing mental health support services in Ireland, and 2) investigate barriers to the use and continuous utilisation of these services. We distributed an anonymous online survey to students at University College Cork through mailing lists and posters. The results presented in this study are a thematic analysis of the open-ended responses describing experiences with mental health support services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis produced three main themes encompassing students' experience seeking support. They include: 1) barriers to service use and engagement, 2) impact of COVID-19 restrictions on service use, and 3) barriers to continued use of support. These themes summarise barriers encountered by students throughout their help-seeking journeys. The process of seeking support was not straightforward, and students often encountered barriers that prevented or delayed their use of services. There is a need to improve mental health literacy in this population, specifically, teaching students how to access support and what to expect from services. In addition, we recommend that mental health support services improve the process of gaining entrance to a service, by making it better suited to the student population.",

Adolescents (N = 1,034; 14-19 years old; M age =16; 50% male, 50% female) from across the United States completed online surveys in January 2021, retrospectively reporting on three periods of 2020 (Pre-COVID 2020, Spring/Summer 2020, and Fall 2020). First, across 2020, many adolescents shifted from in-person worship services to other formats, particularly virtual. Second, while most adolescents perceived they remained stable across 2020 in their religiosity and psychological functioning, some thought they increased while others thought they decreased. Third, paired samples t-tests of retrospectively reported religiosity and psychological functioning during the three periods of 2020 found evidence for possible declines across 2020 in worship service attendance, religious youth activities for adolescents, potential increases in the importance of religion, religious belief, and possible decreases in psychological well-being and increases in psychological distress. Fourth, retrospective reports of religiosity and psychological functioning during Pre-COVID 2020 were correlated-positively for psychological well-being and negatively for psychological distress. Fifth, based on difference scores, possible changes in religiosity were correlated with potential changes in psychological functioning-positively for psychological well-being and negatively for psychological distress. Sixth, auto-regressive cross-lagged models found evidence for possible bidirectional links between religiosity and psychological functioning across 2020; particularly, retrospective reports of religiosity predicted perceived increases in psychological well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic, as a Nonnormative life event, may have influenced adolescent religiosity and psychological functioning across the year 2020.",

    "abstract": "The course of young children's anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis varied. To understand this variability, this longitudinal study examined trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms and associated risk factors. Parents of 503 children aged 1-6 years (48% girls, 99% Dutch) completed a survey in four waves, covering a period of 1.5 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents answered questionnaires regarding children's anxiety and depressive symptoms and risk factors: direct COVID-19 factors (infection, death), family-related COVID-19 factors (parental perceived impact of the pandemic and parent-child emotion regulation strategies), and general caregiver's distress (parental mental health, parental feelings of rejection toward the child). Using latent class growth analyses, anxiety and depressive symptom trajectories were identified. Regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors. For anxiety, two trajectories were identified: low (87.67%) and high (12.33%). For depressive symptoms, three trajectories were identified: low (78.93%), high-decreasing (13.72%), and strong increasing (7.36%). Risk factors for falling within the high anxiety symptoms, or high-decreasing or strong increasing depressive symptoms trajectory, were death of a loved one, parental perceived negative impact of the pandemic, avoidant- and information-focused parent-child emotion regulation strategies, parental mental health problems, and parental feelings of rejection toward the child. Most children were reported to have low levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis, but some children experienced higher symptoms and may benefit from follow-up and support. If a future crisis occurs, it is advised to screen and intervene on a family level to protect young children's mental health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "This article aimed to examine the prospective effects of anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic (virus-specific anxiety, VSA) and perceived stress related to a missile attack in predicting general anxiety episodes during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. Nine hundred ninety-one Israeli adults completed online self-report questionnaires over 7 weeks. The total number of anxiety episodes (defined as an average score of 4 or 5 on two state anxiety items) was predicted by VSA and perceived stress related to missile attacks at Wave 1, controlling for anxiety episodes at baseline (Wave 0) and Wave 1. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to analyze the count data. The number of anxiety episodes was positively correlated with VSA and perceived stress related to missile attacks. The zero-inflated negative binomial model revealed that (a) higher VSA (b = -0.46, p < .001) and perceived stress (b = -0.41, p < .001) at Wave 1 predicted a lower probability of having no anxiety episodes. (b) Only higher levels of VSA at Wave 1 (b = 0.13, p < .001) prospectively predicted the number of anxiety episodes, controlling for anxiety episodes at baseline and Wave 1. Findings support an additive pattern, whereby perceived stress from missile attacks contributed to the onset of an anxiety episode over and above the effect of VSA, while VSA predicted the total number of such episodes. Focusing solely on a single, highly salient stressor may hinder clinicians and policymakers' ability to identify the adverse effect of multiple stressors.

    "abstract": "Baicalin possesses anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the antiviral effect of baicalin against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has not been well-studied. In this study, chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells were used as a model to investigate the antiviral effects of baicalin against the IBV Hebei QX strain. Virus TCID50, the MNTC of baicalin on CEK cells, CPE observation, CCK-8 assay for viral inhibition rate, and qPCR for viral load were performed to evaluate the antiviral effect of baicalin and determine its optimal mechanism of action. Additionally, to explore the molecular mechanism of baicalin's inhibition of IBV infection, we adopted real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess its impact on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5/interferon regulatory factor 7 (MDA5/IRF7) signaling pathways. The results showed that baicalin exhibited a maximum inhibition rate of 68.37% when acting through direct virucidal effects, which was 14.07% higher than the inhibition rate observed under the adsorption-blocking method (54.30%). Under the replication-blocking method, baicalin achieved a maximum inhibition rate of 56.31%, which showed no significant difference from the ribavirin group, but was 2.01% higher than the adsorption-blocking method. These findings suggest that baicalin significantly inhibits IBV replication, with direct virucidal activity as the primary antiviral mechanism. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that baicalin downregulated the expression of NF-κB signaling molecules, suppressed the expression of cytokines such as TRAF6, TAB1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and promoted the relative expression of IL-10. Furthermore, baicalin upregulated the MDA5/IRF7 pathway, enhancing the expression of cytokines IFN-α and IFN-β. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and new insights for the prevention and treatment of IBV in poultry.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the global adoption of telemedicine; however, the triadic model of assisted remote care, where nursing assistants or caregivers facilitate patient interaction with remote physicians, remains underutilized. This narrative review examines the challenges and opportunities associated with assisted telemedicine globally, with a particular focus on the Israeli health care system. Emphasis is placed on health care providers' attitudes, as well as the competencies and training required for effective care delivery within this model. Methods: The review of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar publications was conducted from 2015 to 2025. Results: Evidence suggests that assisted telemedicine contributes to improved patient outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations and mortality among those with chronic conditions. In Israel, despite a robust digital infrastructure, the health care system faces professional shortages, particularly in nursing and secondary care. While current remote services are mostly phone-based, studies indicate that the triadic model of assisted care can enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline physician workflows, and improve continuity of care. Conclusions: The triadic model of assisted telemedicine holds considerable potential for equitable, efficient, and high-quality care. Its success relies on the establishment of clear protocols, robust technological platforms, ethical safeguards, and comprehensive training initiatives for all participants involved.",

Surveys included 6 questions on a four-point Likert-type scale about loneliness in the school context (range: 1-4). Multilevel piecewise regression was used to estimate trends in loneliness scores during 3 periods: 2000-2012, 2012-2015, and 2015-2022. We estimated associations between loneliness and the following country-level factors: COVID-19 mortality, public health distancing measures, internet use, unemployment rate, income inequality (Gini index), and peacefulness. Models of COVID-19-related factors were restricted to 2022. The remaining models included 3 levels (individuals, country-years, and countries), allowing estimation of time-invariant between-country and longitudinal within-country effects. We observed a 0.007-point decrease in mean loneliness scores per year from 2000 to 2012 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.022, 0.008), although this was not statistically significant. Loneliness scores increased by 0.045 points per year from 2012 to 2015 (95% CI: 0.035, 0.054) and by 0.017 points per year from 2015 to 2022 (95% CI: 0.008, 0.025). In within-country models, a one-hour higher country-level weekly internet use and one percentage-point higher unemployment rate were associated with 0.012 (95% CI: -0.021, -0.003) and 0.006 (95% CI: -0.011, -0.001) lower scores per year, respectively. Remaining contextual measures were not associated with loneliness. Loneliness substantially increased from 2012 to 2015, followed by smaller annual increases until 2022. Within countries, greater increases in unemployment rates and internet use over time are associated with lower loneliness.",

    "abstract": "Most cytoplasmic RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to identify their genomic RNA (gRNA) as the sole RNA species to be packaged into assembled virions. Coronaviruses exhibit highly selective packaging of their gRNA, in spite of the presence of a large excess of subgenomic viral and host RNA in infected cells. Failure to accomplish this selectivity does not impair virion assembly but renders the virus vulnerable to host innate immunity. In the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) packaging selectivity is brought about by a packaging signal (PS), an RNA structure found exclusively in gRNA and absent from subgenomic RNAs. However, it is not well resolved how virion structural proteins participate in the recognition of the PS. Previous studies with virions have shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein carboxy-terminal RNA-binding domain (CTD) and the carboxy-terminal tail (domain N3) both have roles in PS recognition. Separately, work with a virus-like particle system has implicated the viral membrane (M) protein as the main factor in this process. Here, we pinpoint key amino acids in the CTD and domain N3 that govern selective gRNA packaging into virions, and we provide genetic evidence that the M protein endodomain also plays a required role. We show that the N protein CTD is the primary determinant of PS recognition, and we localize residues in the CTD structure that are critical for specific and nonspecific RNA binding.",

    "abstract": "β-Coronaviruses hijack host factors to remodel host endo-membranes to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which act as central hubs for the replication of viral genomes. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying DMV formation is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies and has garnered significant attention. However, the host factors involved in DMV formation remain scanty. Here, we employed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based proximity labeling (BiFCPL) strategy to investigate the proteome of DMVs generated by co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 and NSP4. Our analysis identified 62 proteins with high confidence, among which five proteins were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and were further confirmed to be recruited to DMVs through interactions with NSP3/NSP4. Moreover, we demonstrated that the absence of GRAMD1B or TEX2 resulted in the formation of enlarged DMVs induced by either NSP3/NSP4 or coronaviruses infection, and impaired coronaviruses replication as well. Collectively, our study concerning host-virus interactions sheds light on novel host factors involved in DMV formation.",

    "title": "A novel nanoparticle vaccine, based on S1-CTD, elicits robust protective immune responses against porcine deltacoronavirus.",
    "abstract": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), an emerging swine pathogen causing severe enteric disease in piglets, poses cross-species transmission risks, including humans. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of its spike protein harbors a key receptor-binding region with antigenic specificity and cross-protective potential. Here, we developed a novel nanoparticle-based CTD vaccine (CTDnps) by conjugating PDCoV S1-CTD to bacteriophage AP205 capsids, leveraging subunit vaccine advantages in safety, scalability, and affordability, to address urgent needs for PDCoV control. Compared to the CTD monomer, the CTDnps vaccine induced a markedly faster antigen-specific IgG response and greater neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in mice. In immunized sows, the CTDnps vaccine elicited sustained IgG and secretory IgA (sIgA) responses, with serum NAbs persisting up to 60 days post-farrowing at titers exceeding 1:64. Passive transfer of maternal antibodies to newborn piglets significantly reduced viral loads and clinical signs upon PDCoV challenge, whereas histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed reduced viral presence and intestinal damage in the CTDnps-vaccinated group. Furthermore, CTDnps enhanced dendritic cell antigen uptake and upregulated expression of major histocompatibility complex II and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) to activate humoral and cellular immunity. We concluded that the PDCoV S1-CTD nanoparticle vaccine has much potential for robust and prolonged PDCoV prevention. Finally, the formed nanoparticle platform has potentially broad applications for developing multivalent vaccines against diverse coronaviruses. Although porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) poses a potential threat to public health, effective vaccines against PDCoV remain lacking. Here, we developed a novel nanoparticle-based C-terminal domain vaccine (CTDnps) targeting the conserved S1-CTD domain of the PDCoV spike protein. Unlike traditional subunit vaccines, CTDnps displayed AP205 capsids to enhance antigen presentation, induced rapid and robust neutralizing antibodies in sows, and conferred passive immunity to piglets via maternal antibody transfer. Mechanistically, CTDnps promoted dendritic cell activation and cellular immunity by upregulating major histocompatibility complex II and co-stimulatory molecules, a feature absent in monomeric CTD vaccines. We not only established CTDnps as a potent PDCoV intervention, but also pioneered a scalable, fast platform adaptable to emerging or multivalent coronavirus vaccines. This study provided actionable strategies to mitigate PDCoV outbreaks and broader coronavirus threats.",

    "title": "Global-of-care testing (GOCT): emerging challenges for laboratory medicine network.",
    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed laboratory medicine at the forefront of public health and clinical care. Larger use of social media and official communication platforms raised public awareness of laboratory science, driving demand for rapid, accurate diagnostic information and shifting expectations around access and interpretation of testing. Laboratory medicine, rooted in accuracy, precision, reproducibility and clinical relevance, has advanced from basic diagnostics to sophisticated molecular and data-driven platforms. Yet, literature and policy on coordinated international laboratory networks, especially for surveillance and emergency response, remain limited. This opinion paper introduces the concept of \"global-of-care testing\", encompassing globally connected diagnostic infrastructures with regional adaptability, robust governance, and sustained investment in technology and workforce. Laboratory network design must account for geography and population density in allocating facilities. Integrated systems require automation capable of interfacing across multiple platforms (preanalytical processing, clinical chemistry, immunochemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis and even molecular diagnostics and mass spectrometry) to optimize workflows, support real-time decision-making, facilitate remote collaboration and maintain rigorous quality assurance. A decentralized yet interconnected model allows peripheral laboratories to actively participate in clinical decision-making through shared protocols, telemedicine and integrated data, ultimately reducing turnaround times, improving responsiveness and enhancing patient-centred care. Embedding Value-Based Laboratory Medicine (VBLM) within this framework ensures that diagnostics are aligned with health outcomes in a multidisciplinary ecosystem organized around patient needs. The future of laboratory medicine will hence depend on evidence-based reforms that integrate technology, reorganize systems and reinforce governance for promoting quality, equitable access and sustainable precision healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses encode nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15), a conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU) known to suppress host antiviral responses. It is imperative to understand the role of Nsp15/EndoU during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in its primary target respiratory epithelial cells. Using a recombinant wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (rWT) and a mutant with catalytically inactive EndoU (rH234A), we show that the EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication in Vero cells but critically facilitates immune suppression and infection in physiologically relevant human lung cells, including human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Compared to rWT, rH234A infection elicited augmented type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and stronger RNase L activation, suggesting that Nsp15 suppresses these antiviral pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rH234A infection increased PKR phosphorylation, downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and stress granule formation remained limited, implying incomplete PKR/eIF2α pathway activation. Furthermore, Nsp15 mutants lacking key residues required for hexamerization or double-stranded RNA binding also showed impaired replication and heightened IFN responses, highlighting the importance of these structural features for EndoU function. In vivo, rH234A was attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice, resulting in improved survival, reduced viral loads, and milder lung pathology. Together, these findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/EndoU as a key immune antagonist that facilitates lung infection, underscoring its potential as a target for antiviral development.IMPORTANCESevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects upper and lower airway epithelial cells, and the latter infection can result in severe pneumonia. Understanding how the virus evades host immunity in these primary target cells is critical for developing effective therapies. Nsp15, a conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), is known to suppress antiviral responses, but its precise role in respiratory epithelial cells has remained unclear. This study reveals that while EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication, it is essential for dampening host defenses in human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids. Loss of EndoU activity results in enhanced interferon signaling and RNase L activation, along with partial PKR pathway engagement. Structural integrity, including double-stranded RNA binding and hexamerization, is vital for Nsp15 function. In vivo, an EndoU-deficient virus is attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice. These findings position Nsp15 as a key immune antagonist and a promising target for antiviral intervention.",

    "abstract": "The concerns exist regarding the inadequate immune response to inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in some people living with HIV (PLWH). A prospective cohort study was conducted across four regions of Zhejiang, China. Both PLWH and healthy controls (HCs) received two doses of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection were monitored. PLWH with CD4 counts <500 cells/µL received a third dose. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and IgG were measured to evaluate the immunogenicity of each dose. A total of 400 PLWH were enrolled, with 12.2% aged ≥60 years. Adverse reactions to the first two doses were mild or moderate in PLWH (12.0% and 5.5%). After the second dose, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of NAbs was lower in PLWH (46.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 43.6-50.4) compared to HCs (58.2, 95% CI 53.4-63.5). However, seropositivity rates were similar (97.9% vs 100.0%). Single and multifactor generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that PLWH aged ≥60 years with CD4 count <500 cells/µL exhibited a weaker immune response. After a third dose in this subgroup (aged ≥60 years), the GMT of NAbs was 61.5 (95% CI 47.8-79.2), significantly lower than the 18-59 years group. In conclusion, PLWH showed a weaker and delayed immune response after receiving two doses of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Older age combined with a lower CD4+ T cell count posed significant challenges to achieving an adequate immune response. Strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake and overall immunization in PLWH are needed.IMPORTANCEIn this prospective cohort study, we analyzed the safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose schedule of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Covilo) in people living with HIV (PLWH). We also investigated factors associated with antibody titers and seropositivity rates. Additionally, we evaluated the immunogenicity of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine booster in PLWH with CD4+ T cell counts ≤500 cells/µL within both 18-59 and ≥60 years age groups. We found vaccination with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was well-tolerated in PLWH but induced a weaker and delayed immune response compared with healthy controls. Importantly, the older PLWH with low CD4+ T cell counts face considerable challenges in mounting an adequate immune response to vaccines, even after booster immunization. Our findings highlight the need for strategies to improve vaccine immunogenicity in PLWH with low immune responses, particularly among older individuals and those with low CD4+ T cell counts.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT05075070.",

    "abstract": "Globally, tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and care were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Brazil, TB notification rates decreased in the first 2 years of the pandemic. There is a need for rigorous model-based methods to quantify the impact of health system disruptions on TB control. In this study, we aimed to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected both incidence and case detection in Brazilian states. We used a Bayesian evidence synthesis model to estimate TB incidence and case detection rates over the period 2016-21 by using routinely collected case notification and mortality data. We then used a meta-regression framework to estimate factors associated with state-level rates of undiagnosed symptomatic TB. We found that the probability that an individual with symptomatic TB was diagnosed decreased in the majority of states in April 2020 (median = -10.4%age points, interquartile range = -6.6, -16.2). Incident TB decreased slightly in April 2020 and rebounded beginning in 2021. Together, this led to an increase in missed TB cases in nearly every state during the pandemic. Nationally, we estimate that there were 20 671 (95% credible interval: 19 249, 22 501) missed TB cases between April 2020 and December 2021. Disruptions to the Brazilian healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic prevented tens of thousands of individuals with symptomatic disease from receiving a TB diagnosis. While some Brazilian states recovered rapidly to pre-pandemic levels of TB case detection, many did not and the rates of missed TB cases remained high through 2021.",

    "abstract": "Institutions of higher education faced a number of challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chief among them was whether or not to reopen during the second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, which was controversial because incidence in young adults was on the rise. The migration of students back to campuses worried many that transmission within student populations would spread into surrounding communities. In light of this, many colleges and universities implemented mitigation strategies, with varied degrees of success. Washington State University, located in the city of Pullman in Whitman County, WA, is an example of this type of university-community co-location, where the role of students returning to the area for the fall 2020 semester was contentious. Using COVID-19 incidence in Pullman, WA, reported to the Whitman County Health Department, we retrospectively study the transmission dynamics that occurred between the student and community subpopulations in fall 2020. We develop a two-population ordinary differential equations mechanistic model to infer transmission rates within and across the university student and community subpopulations. We use results from Bayesian parameter estimation to determine if exponential transmission of COVID-19 occurred in Pullman, WA, and the magnitude of cross-transmission from students to community members. We find these results are consistent with the estimation of the time-varying reproductive number that outbreak potential was minimal and resolved quickly, and conclude that the students returning to Washington State University-Pullman did not place the surrounding community at disproportionate risk of COVID-19 during fall 2020 when mitigation efforts were in place.",

Pre-existing chronic respiratory diseases may influence patient outcomes, and understanding their role is essential for improving healthcare strategies during such crises. This study analysed data from the Italian hospital discharge records database to explore the association between chronic respiratory diseases and in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19. Patients hospitalized in 2020 were studied, with exposure to respiratory diseases assessed based on hospitalizations between 2010 and 2019. Cox regression models were used to adjust for demographic and clinical factors, including age, gender, and comorbidity. Patients with pre-existing chronic respiratory diseases (n = 28 375, 13.9% of the total study population of 203 820) had a 71% higher risk (hazard ratio: 1.71, confidence interval: 1.54-1.90, P < .001) of in-hospital mortality compared to those without such conditions. Age, gender, the number of previous hospitalizations, and the Charlson comorbidity index were identified as key factors in mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated significant differences in survival probabilities between exposed and unexposed groups across various age categories. Chronic respiratory diseases are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in vulnerable populations to reduce the impact of future pandemics.",

This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on long-term sickness absence (SA) with common mental disorders (CMDs) and antidepressant prescriptions in different employment branches and age groups in Sweden. Using national registers, we observed the Swedish population (18-65 years) with gainful employment quarterly from 2018 to 2021. An interrupted time-series design was employed to examine changes in trends of incidence rates (IRs) for (i) long-term (>90 days) SA with CMDs and for (ii) antidepressant prescriptions across eight employment branches during versus pre-pandemic. Analyses were stratified by age group. There was no evidence of outcome changes in the entire working age population. However, compared to pre-pandemic levels, the IRs of long-term SA with CMD increased by 5.9% per quarter for those working in the cultural sector [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2%-9.8%], 3.4% in trade and transportation (95% CI: 0.4%-6.4%), and 5.5% in manufacturing and services (95% CI: 1.5%-9.7%) as well as among individuals aged 56-64. Incident antidepressant prescription rates were marginally higher for workers in construction (1.1% annual increase; 95% CI: 0.1%-2.1%), culture (1.4%; 0.7%-2.0%), and trade and transportation (0.9%; 0.1%-1.7%). While the risk of CMD-related long-term SA or incident antidepressant prescription in Swedish workers did not appear to be impacted by the pandemic, certain employment branches and older individuals were negatively affected in terms of both outcomes.

    "abstract": "Negative control outcomes (NCOs) are useful tools for hidden bias detection, but empirical evidence validating NCOs for COVID-19 is lacking. To address this gap, we examined the blinded phase of the randomized, placebo-controlled Coronavirus Vaccine Efficacy (COVE; NCT04470427) trial of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. We confirmed that acute respiratory illness with a positive test for a non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen on a multiplex PCR panel was a valid NCO for COVID-19, considering that it was unaffected by vaccination (vaccine efficacy, VE=3.3% (95% CI, -22.3-23.6)) yet strongly associated with COVID-19 (odds ratio=2.95 (95% CI, 2.00-4.24)). Subsequently, we leveraged non-SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect bias in time-varying VE estimates from COVE's blinded and booster phases. Balanced incidence of non-SARS-CoV-2 infection between vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19-free risk sets suggested low selection bias in VE estimates of two-dose mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 during the blinded phase (VE=92.5% (95% CI, 88.8-94.9) 14 days post-dose-two, stable for 5 months). In COVE's booster phase, higher non-SARS-CoV-2 incidence was observed after the single booster (intensity ratio, IR=2.38 (95% CI, 1.75-3.25) 14 days post-boost), suggesting that booster VE estimates may underestimate the true VE against COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate the potential of off-target infections for unraveling complex biases in COVID-19 vaccine studies.",

Of the 100 top drug classes contributing to total drug spending in 2020, we categorized those prescribed for chronic diseases into 26 drug groups; specifically, drugs for psychiatric and neurologic, cardiac and respiratory, hormone-related, and immune and musculoskeletal conditions. Using administrative health data on all dispensed medications, we quantified adherence by monthly proportion of days covered (PDC) and performed interrupted time-series analysis (ITS) to estimate changes in PDC trends 1-year before and after the implementation of pandemic mitigation measures. We included 3,906,377 adults with ≥1 prescription to ≥1 included drug groups. The most common prescriptions among our study population were for antidepressants (45.0%), drugs for obstructive airway diseases (41.6%), renin-angiotensin system agents (30.5%), diuretics (28.2%), and lipid modifying agents (24.8%). ITS models for 22 of 26 drug groups showed statistically significant changes in monthly PDC trends, with the greatest change occurring among parenteral immunosuppressants, injectable insulins and analogues, and renin-angiotensin system agents. Findings suggest that the pandemic did not substantially impact adherence to commonly used medications; however, adherence was found to be suboptimal across all drug groups regardless of the impact of COVID-19.

Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed GC/EGJC, confirmed dMMR/MSI-H status, and clinically staged as cT3-4aNxM0 or cT2N + M0 (AJCC 8th edition) based on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, upper endoscopy, diagnostic laparoscopy, and peritoneal lavage cytology. Patients received four cycles of neoadjuvant toripalimab (240 mg IV every 3 weeks) plus CapeOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on Days 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV on Day 1), followed by curative-intent surgery and up to four cycles of the same regimen as adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint was the major pathological response (MPR) rate, defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor cells in the tumor specimen resected after neoadjuvant therapy. All patients who received at least one dose of treatment were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04744649. Between March 12, 2021 and June 1, 2024, twenty-two patients were screened, with sixteen meeting the inclusion criteria and undergoing treatment. Tumor stages were cT2N1 (n = 1), cT3N0-3 (n = 3), and cT4aN1-3 (n = 12). Fifteen patients completed four cycles of therapy preoperatively, while one patient completed two cycles due to adverse events. None of patients experienced disease progression. One patient achieved a complete clinical response as indicated by radiology and endoscopy and consequently refused surgery, while the remaining fifteen patients underwent resection. The R0 resection rate was 100% (15/15). The MPR rate was 93.3% (14/15), and the pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 80% (12/15). Six patients (37.5%, 6/16) experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events. One patient died of COVID-19 287 days post-surgery without relapse. No disease relapse was observed in any patient. Given the small sample size and limited population diversity, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, neoadjuvant toripalimab combined with the CapeOX regimen is feasible for localized advanced dMMR/MSI-H GC/EGJC, demonstrating high MPR and pCR rates without unexpected adverse events.

    "title": "Converging evidence for reduced global atmospheric oxidation in 2020.",
    "abstract": "The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a central role in the oxidation of methane and many other reduced gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The inter-annual changes of global mean OH concentrations are poorly constrained, posing challenges to understanding annual methane budgets. Here, we use observations of multiple atmospheric species to investigate the anomaly of global OH concentration in 2020. We develop a new method to infer the zonal distribution of OH concentrations from satellite carbon monoxide (CO) observations. This method finds that the global OH concentration reduced by 4.0% ± 0.9% in 2020 relative to 2018-2019 and that the reduction occurred in both Northern (2.4% ± 1.2%) and Southern (5.7% ± 1.2%) Hemispheres. This result is also consistent with our analysis of methane and methyl chloroform observations. Atmospheric chemistry simulations suggest that the OH reduction in the Northern Hemisphere is primarily explained by reduced reactive nitrogen emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns and in the Southern Hemisphere partly by enhanced reactive carbon emissions from extreme Australian fires, hence resulting in distinct chemical mechanisms for OH reduction in the two hemispheres. This contrast is further supported by opposite anomalies in hemispheric tropospheric ozone observed by satellite. Our results highlight the critical role of both anthropogenic and natural perturbations in reduced atmospheric oxidation and rapid methane increases in 2020. This has important implications for future scenarios, given the projected decrease in anthropogenic emissions and increase in fire emissions.",

    "abstract": "Parents influence children's lifestyle behaviors, though this influence may decline as children gain autonomy. However, the COVID-19 pandemic likely altered these dynamics due to increased time at home. We examined whether associations between parenting practices and adolescents' physical activity and recreational screen-time changed during the transition to secondary school in two cohorts: one assessed pre-pandemic and one during the pandemic. Data were collected in British Columbia (2018-2021) at two time points (elementary and secondary school) among 689 parent-adolescent dyads (parent age: 46 ± 5.4 years, 73 % mothers; child age: 13 ± 0.3 years, 52 % female). Forty-two percent were assessed pre-pandemic, and 58 % during the pandemic. Both cohorts self-reported parenting practices, recreational screen-time, and physical activity; non-pandemic children also wore accelerometers. Mixed-effect models with parenting-by-grade interaction terms assessed within-cohort changes over time. Supportive parenting predicted lower self-reported recreational screen-time and higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (non-pandemic: b = -25, 95 %CI:-38,-12 & b = 0.66, 95 %CI:0.38,0.93; pandemic: b = -19, 95 %CI:-30,-8 & b = 0.63, 95 %CI:0.32,0.93). In non-pandemic families, supportive parenting also predicted weekday light and MVPA (b = 12, 95 %CI:4,21 & b = 9, 95 %CI:4,14), though the latter significantly weakened post-transition (b = -11, 95 %CI:-19,-2). Our findings highlight the importance of positive parenting in supporting children's active lifestyles, particularly during key life transitions.",

    "title": "The Role of Poly Vinyl Pyrrolidone Iodine (PVP-I) in Preventing Cross-Infection during Dental Procedures: A Systematic Review in the COVID-19 Context.",
    "abstract": "As the dental community navigates the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, mitigating the risk of viral cross-transmission among dentists and dental clinic operators remains paramount. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine (PVP-I) has emerged as a promising agent in reducing the chance of cross-transmission, primarily through its broad-spectrum antiseptic properties and ability to kill viruses rapidly. This study aimed to explore the role of PVP-I in preventing cross-infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and assess its effectiveness as a prophylaxis before dental treatment. A comprehensive search of multiple databases, including Science Direct, PubMed, Sage Journal, Cochrane, and Wiley Online Library, was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The study selection process utilized the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Design framework (P: SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, I: PVP-I mouthwash, C: various PVP-I concentrations, O: virucidal effect, S: randomized-controlled trials and clinical trials). Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance, and full-text articles were assessed for eligibility based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2 for randomized controlled trials and Toxicological Data Reliability Assessment Tool for in vitro studies. A total of 11 articles (seven in vitro and four in vivo) were included in the systematic review. Our findings suggest that PVP-I exhibits superior antiseptic properties compared to other agents, with gargling using PVP-I solutions of 0.2% and 0.5% demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing viral load in saliva. Notably, PVP-I showed rapid virucidal action, effectively reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and potentially lowering the risk of cross-infection during dental procedures. However, despite these promising results in viral reduction, the evidence remains insufficient to definitively recommend PVP-I as a routine clinical prophylaxis for preventing cross-infection in dental care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further large-scale clinical trials are necessary to establish its widespread use. This systematic review highlights the potential of PVP-I as a critical antiseptic in dental settings to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The rapid and significant reduction in viral load suggests that PVP-I could play a pivotal role in infection control protocols. Nonetheless, further robust clinical trials are essential to confirm its efficacy and guide its adoption in routine dental care practices.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the dynamic patterns of ORF1ab and N gene Ct values in oropharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assess their clinical and laboratory correlations. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 259 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Jilin Province between 2021-2023. Comparative analyses were performed on: (1) variant-specific Ct value trajectories for ORF1ab and N genes, (2) nucleic acid conversion times, and (3) longitudinal hematological and biochemical parameters. B.1 variant exhibited the lowest median Ct values (ORF1ab: 31.37; N gene: 30.49) and longest median nucleic acid conversion time (18 days). BA.2 variant demonstrated the highest median Ct values (ORF1ab: 33.00; N gene: 32.00) and shortest conversion time (14 days). Disease progression correlated with: increased creatinine (CREA), neutrophil percentage (NE%), and coagulation markers (D-dimer). Decreased lymphocyte percentage (LY%). Significant inter-variant differences were observed in viral clearance kinetics (Ct values and conversion times) and organ dysfunction markers. These findings highlight variant-specific pathophysiological profiles, with B.1 showing prolonged viral shedding and Omicron subvariants (particularly BA.2) exhibiting faster clearance but distinct hematological perturbations.",

Retrospective clinical data from 185 COVID-19 patients were stratified into four-time points based on their survival status and length of hospital stay (<8> days). Chi-square tests, two-way ANOVA, multinomial logistic regression analyses, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to study their associations, strengths, and risk. The frequency distributions of blood groups among COVID-19 patients were A (19.45%), B (26.48%); AB (7.02%); and O (47.02%), respectively. Even though patients in the O-blood group had the highest infection rate (47.02%), patients in the AB blood group had the maximum severity and mortality and patients in the A-blood group had the most negligible mortality. The mean overall survival time among different blood groups was O (23), A (19), B (24), and AB (17) days. Mean platelet count (%), aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and hospital stay were increased (P < 0.005) in the AB blood group among survivors >8 days. Total leukocyte count (TLC) cells/mm3 levels were increased among nonsurvivors in <8 days in the AB blood group (P < 0.005). Lactate dehydrogenase U/L was increased (P < 0.005) in A blood group of nonsurvivors of <8 days. Even though O blood group patients had the highest infection rate, AB group patients had the most severe disease accompanied by the least survival.

    "abstract": "Blood transfusion services were seriously affected during COVID-19 not only due to limited availability of blood components but also due to gap in the clinical knowledge about the need for transfusion in COVID-19 patients. However, understanding the transfusion needs is essential for inventory management. We analyzed the utilization of blood components in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and recorded the outcome of the patients who were transfused. The study included all COVID-19 patients who underwent transfusions over a time period. Patient details included demographics, clinical condition, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and outcome. Details of transfusion were collected from the blood bank and patient records. Of 3052 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 395 (12.9%) were transfused blood components and were included in the study. Comorbidities were identified in 85% of these patients. Red blood cell (RBC) was transfused in 348 (11.4%) with a mean of 2.3 units/patient. Similarly, platelets and fresh frozen plasma were transfused in 3.3% of patients (mean 6.2 units) and 3% (mean 4.9 units), respectively. Transfusion triggers were largely restrictive in nature. Patients with haemato-oncologic conditions required significantly higher numbers of RBCs and random donor platelets. RBCs transfusion were also higher in patients requiring intensive care unit care and ventilatory support. Blood components usage was not affected by severity of COVID-19 disease, comorbidity index, or coagulopathy. Blood utilization in COVID-19 patients is typically low. Blood components were mainly required by patients with preexisting comorbidities, or those requiring critical care. RBCs were the predominant blood component transfused. Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 did not necessitate transfusion.",

Donors are selected based on the deferral criteria given by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and amended thereof. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination became mandatory after the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and was included in the deferral criteria. The objective was to study and analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the deferral pattern in blood donors. A retrospective study was carried out in the Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion for pre-COVID period from January 2019 to December 2019 for the most common reason of deferral before COVID-19 and for comparison for donor deferral with COVID-19 period. Then, a retrospective study was carried out over a period of 12 months from February 2021 to January 2022. The demographic details of donors such as age, gender, voluntary or replacement donation, and temporary and permanent reasons for deferral were recorded. The data were entered in the MS Excel sheet and descriptive statistics were calculated. The total numbers of registered donors were 7064. Six thousand two hundred and sixty-four donors were accepted for donation, of which voluntary donations were 4478 (71.48%). The deferred donors were 800 (11.3%). Seven hundred and thirty-eight (92.26%) deferred donors were male; the most common cause of temporary deferral was COVID-19 vaccination 179 (22.37%), followed by low hemoglobin 162 (20.25%). The common causes of permanent deferral were high blood pressure 36 (5.17%) and history of unknown jaundice 10 (1.43%). COVID-19 vaccination had a significant impact on the pattern of donor deferral. However, this was only a temporary situation till the pandemic is over. The loss of potential donors has adversely impacted the transfusion services.",

    "abstract": "This study examines COVID-19 transmission across 3,142 U.S. counties using a truncated dataset from March to September 2020. County-level factors include demographics, socioeconomic status, environmental conditions, and mobility patterns. Ordinary Least Squares regression establishes a baseline for analyzing COVID-19 confirm case counts for each county. We then use Moran's I to evaluate spatial clustering, prompting Spatial Autoregressive and Spatial Error Models when autocorrelation is significant. Notably, spatial models outperform the Ordinary Least Squares approach-R 2 rises from 0.4849 with Ordinary Least Squares to 0.6846 under Spatial Error Model, while RMSE decreases from 2.0891 to 1.642-demonstrating improved fit and more accurate spatial transmission dynamics. A multilevel framework further explores state-level policy variations. Finally, Geographically Weighted Regression captures spatial non-stationarity by mapping local coefficient differences; we visualized temperature, precipitation, and other key variables-revealing precipitation peaks near 110° W in the Southeast and Northeast and strong sensitivity to temperature. This integrated sequence of methods provides a comprehensive lens for studying epidemiological phenomena. While certain findings align with established research, other variables reveal unexpected patterns. The proposed framework offers a robust template for future investigations where spatial dependence and policy heterogeneity warrant close examination.",

    "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic presented serious challenges in accessing health care, especially for individuals with hearing loss who rely heavily on both sight and sound. Communication and routine care, such as hearing aid management, were negatively impacted by the mandatory use of face masks and the limited availability of clinics. Objective This study aimed to assess the difficulties faced by patients with hearing loss who were prescribed hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate their awareness and acceptance of telehealthcare services. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Armed Forces Hospital, Southern Region in Aseer Province, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 210 individuals aged 18-65 years who had a medical diagnosis of hearing loss and were using conventional hearing aids prescribed between 2017 and 2019. SPSS version 22 was used for both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. Results Among the 210 respondents, 109 (51.9%) reported difficulty communicating with individuals wearing face masks, primarily due to an inability to lip-read (n = 15, 7.3%) and muffled speech (n = 75, 35.8%). Despite this, 130 participants (61.9%) experienced no difficulty using their hearing aids while wearing a mask. Although 166 (80.2%) preferred in-person consultations over telehealth, 69 (32.8%) reported being less likely to visit a clinic due to the pandemic. Communication challenges were more prevalent among users with bilateral (n = 42, 20.0%) and severe hearing loss (n = 57, 27.1%). Statistically significant associations were found between hearing loss type and both preference for in-person visits (χ² = 6.01, p = 0.049) and mask-related communication difficulty (χ² = 12.37, p = .002). Conclusion The use of face masks and restricted clinic access during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly inconvenienced individuals using hearing aids. Although tele-audiology presents a promising alternative, uptake remains low due to limited patient awareness and acceptance. Investment in telehealth infrastructure and expanded patient education is essential to ensure continuity of hearing care during future public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "The pervasive rise of digital media and screen-based entertainment has transformed the developmental landscape for children and adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic further amplified screen exposure, exacerbating public health concerns. While digital media offers educational, social, and recreational benefits, growing concerns have emerged regarding its adverse health outcomes. Several international guidelines recommend limited screen time particularly for children under five; however, adherence remains inconsistent. This review combines recent global data and research findings to examine the physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, and emotional health consequences of digital media use and excessive screen time among youth. Physical effects include increased risks of obesity, sleep disturbances, visual impairments, and musculoskeletal pain, particularly with prolonged sedentary behaviors. Mental health outcomes are equally concerning, with excessive screen exposure associated with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and, alarmingly, self-harm and suicidal tendencies. Screen time exceeding 2-4 hours per day is consistently linked with increased cognitive and developmental health risks, though the threshold for harm remains debated. Despite some potential benefits of high-quality, interactive content, the evidence highlights the need for balanced media use, age-appropriate limits, and active parental guidance. By integrating findings from international studies and public health recommendations, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for clinicians, educators, and policymakers to develop targeted strategies that promote healthier digital behaviors in children and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies safeguard our health through their precise and potent binding to specific antigens, demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of numerous diseases, including COVID-19. Recent advancements in biomedical language models have shown the great potential to interpret complex biological structures and functions. However, existing antibody-specific models have a notable limitation that they lack explicit consideration for antibody structural information, despite the fact that both 1-dimensional sequence and 3-dimensional structure carry unique and complementary insights into antibody behavior and functionality. This paper proposes the Sequence-Structure multi-level pre-trained Antibody Language Model (S2ALM), combining holistic sequential and structural information in one unified, generic antibody foundation model. We construct a hierarchical pre-training paradigm incorporated with 2 customized multi-level training objectives to facilitate the modeling of comprehensive antibody representations. S2ALM's representation space uncovers inherent functional binding mechanisms, biological evolution properties, and structural interaction patterns. Pre-trained over 75 million sequences and 11.7 million structures, S2ALM can be adopted for diverse downstream tasks: accurately predicting antigen-antibody binding affinities, precisely distinguishing B cell maturation stages, identifying antibody crucial binding positions, and specifically designing novel coronavirus-binding antibodies. Remarkably, S2ALM outperforms well-established and renowned baselines and sets new state-of-the-art performance across extensive antibody-specific understanding and generation tasks. S2ALM's ability to model comprehensive and generalized representations further positions its potential to advance real-world therapeutic antibody development, potentially addressing unmet academic, industrial, and clinical needs.",

This study aimed to identify the care complexity factors according to age in older people hospitalized with COVID-19. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2022 at eight public hospitals in Spain. All older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were classified in the following groups: young-old (65-74 years), middle-old (75-84 years), and oldest-old (≥85 years). The main variable was care complexity individual factors (CCIFs), which included 27 CCIFs classified in four domains: comorbidity/complications, psycho-emotional, mental-cognitive, and sociocultural. Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to identify the association of each CCIFs with age group. A total of 5,658 admissions were included. Of these, 46.3% were young-old (65-74 years), 34.8% middle-old (75-84 years) and 18.8% oldest-old (≥85 years). The analysis shows that middle-old (75-84 years) patients were associated with chronic disease, position impairment, urinary or fecal incontinence, anatomical and functional disorders, vascular fragility, involuntary movements, fear or anxiety and mental status impairments. Extreme weight, communication disorders, aggressive behavior, agitation and perception reality disorders were additional factors associated with the oldest-old (≥85 years) inpatients with COVID-19. The median number of CCIFs was higher in the oldest-old than in the other age groups (four in young-old [65-74 years]; six in middle-old [75-84 years]; seven in oldest-old [≥85 years] [OR:2.9; 95%CI:2.8-3.1; p < 0.001]). The oldest groups of patients (≥75 years) admitted with COVID-19 had more CCIFs than the young-old group. CCIFs should be included in patient assessment in order to identify care needs in older hospitalized patients.",

We extracted data on incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) for 12 categories of mental disorders from 1990 to 2021 across 204 countries and territories grouped into 21 regions. Trends in ASIR and ASDR were also analyzed during the COVID-19 period (2019-2021). From 1990 to 2021, global ASIR rose by 15.23% (12.97% to 17.60%), while ASDR increased by 73.52% (70.24% to 76.71%). All 21 GBD regions saw a rise in cases and DALYs. In 2021, Central sub-Saharan Africa had the highest ASIR (8706.11), and East Asia reported the lowest (3340.99). Australasia recorded the highest ASDR (2787.87). On the national level, Greenland, Greece, United States, and Australia had the greatest ASDR values. During the pandemic years, ASIR and ASDR rose across all five socio-demographic index levels and GBD regions, with the exception of East Asia, where rates remained stable. Females experienced a higher ASDR than males in 2021. Major depressive disorder (557.87) and anxiety disorders (524.33) were the most burdensome among the 12 types, with depressive disorders ranking first in 13 out of the 21 regions. The GBD study 2021 results highlight a continued and worsening global burden of mental disorders, further intensified by the COVID-19 crisis. This underscores the urgent need to reinforce mental health care systems. Special attention should be directed toward high-middle socio-demographic index areas and female populations. Expanding access to mental health services, enhancing public awareness, and delivering targeted interventions are essential to lessen the growing impact of mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores vaccine hesitancy through the lens of management learning in public healthcare during pandemics. It addresses the need for qualitative insights from active academics, focusing on their uncertainties and ambivalence regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The study aims to deepen understanding of vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic from a management learning perspective, examining healthcare systems, governance, and community trust. Using a qualitative approach, the research draws from a multidisciplinary research network in health and digital society. A total of 27 scholars from 17 countries participated in an open-ended questionnaire designed to elicit insights on the strategies, ethics, and public responses associated with national COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Data collection occurred from May 2021 to July 2021, during the initial rollout of vaccines to broader populations. The analysis employed a hermeneutical framework, using thematic analysis to interpret textual data. Illustrative accounts enriched the contextual understanding. The resulting themes are information and disinformation; social inclusion and exclusion; trust and distrust; individual liberties and collective constraints. The findings indicate that individual nations actions play a role in shaping public discourse, opinion, and political responses related to vaccination, despite a globalized context. The analysis reveals that historical and political factors significantly influence public health policies and perceptions of vaccine hesitancy, together with the importance of information and dialogue with various stakeholders to create trust. The COVID-19 crisis, characterized by threats and uncertainties, has strained trust in public health institutions. A management learning perspective can be adopted that embraces a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding COVID-19 vaccination. By fostering collaborative learning and stakeholder engagement, public health organizations can enhance their responsiveness and build trust within communities.",

This review aimed to categorize virtual-based prenatal care methods and their reported clinical and nonclinical outcomes. This scoping review was conducted by searching the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, SID, Irandoc, Magiran databases, and Google Scholar search engine from January 2005 to February 2021 and completed until December 2023. Our included studies were quantitative and review studies in English that mentioned virtual prenatal care and related outcomes. We followed the narrative approach for presenting and synthesizing results and PRISMA-ScR guidelines for the accompanying explanation. After retrieving 1324 studies and removing duplicates, 35 articles were reviewed. We divided virtual-based prenatal care into two main categories: only using virtual methods and modified care models by virtual methods. Mhealth was the most widely used virtual care method due to its accessibility to most mothers, low cost, and use of dedicated apps. The reported outcomes were also classified into seven subcategories. Maternal and neonatal outcomes, maternal and provider satisfaction, and change in patient knowledge, attitude, and practice were the three most commonly reported outcomes. Improvement of a variety of clinical and nonclinical outcomes is anticipated to facilitate the effective implementation of tailored virtual interventions for mothers, ultimately improving health outcomes for both mothers and fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID (LC) is a condition characterized by the persistence of physical or psychological symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. While its pathophysiology remains unclear, it is essential to identify acute-phase risk factors associated with its development. This study aimed to investigate the association between symptoms during acute COVID-19 and the risk of developing LC, and to evaluate the impact of LC on functional status in a nonhospitalized population. A retrospective observational case-control study was conducted between May 2022 and March 2024 including 434 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were classified as cases (those with LC; n = 226) or controls (those without LC; n = 208). Data were collected using a structured electronic form, including self-reported sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle information. Severity and number of acute symptoms were recorded. Functional status was assessed using the Post-COVID functional status (PCFS) Scale. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to explore associations, adjusted for potential confounders. Severe acute COVID-19 (defined as pneumonia or hospitalization) was associated with a significantly increased risk of LC (adjusted OR = 7.22; 95% CI: 2.79-18.70). Additionally, each additional symptom during the acute phase increased the odds of LC by 52% (adjusted OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.35-1.77). Dyspnea and chest pain were the symptoms most strongly associated with LC. The severity and symptom burden of acute COVID-19 are strongly associated with the development of LC and with long-term functional impairment. These findings highlight the importance of early identification and follow-up in patients with severe initial COVID-19 symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in literature on emerging nanotechnologies, including nanoparticles, nanorobots, and exosomes, for various therapeutic applications. Additionally, politically driven research initiatives aimed at accelerating COVID-19 vaccine development have further amplified interest in nanoparticles as drug delivery systems. This article provides a personal perspective on the scientific claims surrounding nanoparticles by: (i) analyzing the historical evolution of their terminology, (ii) reviewing the most cited publications in the field, and (iii) offering a professional assessment to guide the next-generation of medicinal chemists. A key aspect of this discussion is the stealth effect, which refers to the ability of nanoparticles to evade recognition and clearance by the immune system, thereby prolonging their circulation time in the bloodstream. This property is essential for enhancing the efficacy of nanoparticle-based therapeutics by improving bioavailability and ensuring targeted drug delivery to diseased tissues. Furthermore, the continuing improvement in ligand-molecules and other functional tools have developed novel strategies and brand-new definition of delivery systems, such as Trojan Horse and Nanorobots.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 transmission and detection on academic campuses in low- to middle-income countries has not been explored. The present study explored wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a campus setting in Pune, Maharashtra, India, offering insights into variant-specific trends and their correlation with clinical cases over a 2.5 year period from November 2021 to April 2024. We collected 242 wastewater samples from the campus sewershed and processed them to extract RNA and perform RT-qPCR and sequencing, followed by lineage assignment using the LCS tool. Early signals of different SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as BA.2.X, JN.1.X, and KP.2.X, were detected in wastewater prior to its first clinical report in Maharashtra, India. Wastewater viral load strongly correlated with clinical cases during the Omicron phase (ρ = 0.73-0.81) compared to the post-Omicron phase (ρ = -0.06 to 0.31). This study also highlights that alerts and warnings issued on the basis of wastewater viral hikes have proven instrumental in preventing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants on campus. However, downgrading COVID-19 from pandemic status by the WHO resulted in a subsequent decrease in public vigilance, changing the viral dynamic in the last phase of the study. This study showcases the utility of wastewater surveillance in a campus setting as an early warning system and understands the interplay of public health policy effects in viral dynamics within controlled ecosystems, such as campuses or offices.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphorus compounds, widely used as flame retardants and plasticizers in plastic products, present significant health risks due to their potential adverse effects. While inhalation and ingestion are well-studied exposure pathways, dermal exposure remains underexplored. In recent years, the growing popularity of gamingdriven by extended home stays during the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of e-sports in international competitionshas led to prolonged contact with gaming devices, particularly among young people and professional gamers. This study investigates dermal exposure to triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) from 37 home-use video game controllers. TPhP was detected in 5 first-party and 22 third-party controllers, with concentrations reaching up to 530 μg g-1. Using artificial skin (EPISKIN), we measured a TPhP skin permeation rate of 0.42 ng cm-2 h-1. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate daily dermal intake rates; professional gamers (5th percentile-50th percentile-95th percentile, 9.0-22-45 ng kg-1 day-1) and e-sports students (5.3-8.5-18 ng kg-1 day-1) were identified as the most exposed groups due to prolonged gaming sessions. Remarkably, dermal exposure from the controller was found to rival or exceed other pathways, including dust ingestion and inhalation. This study highlights the urgent need for strategies to mitigate dermal exposure risks from gaming devices.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), being associated with larger infarct size (IS) and worse left ventricular remodeling (LVR). Methotrexate (MTX) is a potent anti-inflammatory drug with potential benefits in the treatment of STEMI. Experimental studies have suggested that a formulation of MTX incorporated into lipid nanoemulsion (LDE-MTX) could be beneficial and safe. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDE-MTX in patients with STEMI. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study. Patients were randomized 4 ± 2 days after first anterior STEMI to receive LDE-MTX (40 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) or LDE-placebo weekly for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance at 90 ± 7 days post-randomization; the main secondary endpoints were changes in LVEDV, other LVR parameters and IS. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the study was stopped prematurely, with 32 randomized patients (15 LDE-placebo, 17 LDE-MTX) completing the protocol. At 90 days, there was no difference in LVEDV between groups. Among other secondary endpoints, there appeared to be a greater reduction of IS (%LV) in favor of the LDE-MTX group (-3.9 ± 6.9 vs -9.4 ± 8.4, p = 0.030). LDE-MTX was well tolerated. In patients with STEMI, LDE-MTX appears to be safe but did not influence LVEDV and other LVR parameters, although it possibly reduced infarct size at 90 days. These hypothesis-generating results support further investigation of a novel nanomedicine approach to STEMI in larger trials.",

Viral infections have been proposed as contributing triggers, supported by the disease's seasonal pattern, which typically shows higher incidence in autumn and winter. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdowns created a unique context to examine the incidence and seasonality of T1DM during a period characterized by reduced circulation of common viral infections. To investigate the incidence and seasonality of T1DM before and during COVID-19 pandemic in relation to global viral infection rates. This population-based retrospective study utilized a nationwide computerized database. Extracted data included the number of new T1DM cases over the 8 years preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic, demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and nationwide respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction data from weekly nasal wash sample collections. A total of 2176 patients were diagnosed with new-onset T1DM during the pre-pandemic period, compared to 348 cases during the pandemic. In the same periods, 33727 respiratory virus-positive polymerase chain reaction results from nasal wash samples were recorded pre-pandemic, compared to 2603 during the pandemic. Additionally, 363399 positive COVID-19 cases were reported during the pandemic period. Seasonality analysis revealed a higher rate of new-onset T1DM cases and a weaker seasonal pattern during the pandemic. Trend analysis showed a consistent increase in T1DM incidence prior to COVID-19, with a more variable trend observed during the pandemic. Correlation analysis between T1DM incidence and respiratory viruses demonstrated a weak correlation between T1DM incidence and a few respiratory viruses. The observed increase in new-onset T1DM cases and the disruption of its typical seasonal pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a potential association between respiratory virus exposure and the development of T1DM.",

This will provide a status update on the current situation of publication productivity on the related topic, while simultaneously studying the potential effect of COVID-19 pandemic on it. We looked into articles and reviews published between 2020 and 2023 in Scopus based on predefined inclusion criteria which included neurotrauma-related publications sourced or co-authored by authors from war-stricken countries. 80 articles were included in the final analysis. The global research publication output, contributions of countries, institutions, journals, authors, average citation index (ACI), and keywords were analyzed. There was a rise in publication productivity in 2020, which declined in 2021 and then again increased in 2022 onward.

However, access to state-level paid sick leave during the pandemic had the potential to reduce the mental health burden of financial hardship-a possibility that has not been tested in prior research. Using nationally representative survey data on more than 1.7 million individuals from the Household Pulse Survey (August 2020 to November 2022) merged with state-level data on paid sick leave policies, we estimated a battery of two-way fixed-effects linear probability models to examine whether paid leave policies buffered the association between financial hardship and depression and anxiety risks. Results show that experiencing financial hardship increased depression and anxiety risks but that the mental health consequences of financial hardship were dampened for respondents living in a state with an active paid sick leave policy. Moreover, because racially minoritized adults, women, transgender adults, and less-educated adults were more likely to experience financial hardship over the period, our study highlights the potential for paid leave policies to reduce population inequities in mental health. We point to paid sick leave policies as an important macro-level determinant of mental health with especially salient mental health consequences for marginalized groups.",

    "abstract": "Hip fractures are a common serious injury in older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on hip fracture prevention services, but contemporary data on incidence are scarce. We investigated recent trends and variation in the incidence of hip fracture in England. A population-based study was conducted of hip fracture hospital presentations in adults aged ≥50 years using English national secondary care data (January 2014-October 2024). Trends in incidence were compared across pre-pandemic (January 2014-February 2020), pandemic (March-2020-July-2021), and post-pandemic periods (August 2021-October 2024). Variation by age, sex, and area-level deprivation were explored. From 2014 to 2024, there were 704,762 hip fractures in 669,101 patients. Age-standardised incidence rates steadily declined from 2014 to 2019 from a mean monthly rate of 28.0-26.4 per 100,000 population. Incidence rates were below expected levels during the pandemic (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97) but above expected levels in the post-pandemic period (IRR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04), resulting in 5595 more hip fractures than expected from August 2021 to October 2024. Hip fractures were more common in women, but temporal trends were consistent by sex. Incidence rates were higher in the most compared with the least deprived quintile; these inequalities remained largely unchanged by 2024 (IRR, 95% CI 1.67 [1.45-1.93] in men; 1.30 [1.19-1.42] in women). This study highlights an excess of hip fracture presentations to hospital since the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued disparities in incidence by deprivation, despite an overall decreasing long-term trend. More equitable prevention strategies are needed, such as through more widespread screening for fracture risk and better coverage of fracture liaison services.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique and widespread challenge that profoundly impacted the well-being of individuals across all age groups. This study aimed to identify the latent classes of resilience among a nationwide sample of US adults and characterize these classes according to their socio-demographic profiles. We conducted a survey of 3,340 US adults from March to June 2020 through Qualtrics panel participants, stratified demographically to represent the US population by gender, race, age, and geographic region. A latent class analysis was performed to identify distinct profiles of resilience based on emotions, behaviors, physical symptoms, coping resources, and social support. Four latent classes of resilience were identified among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: Low Mental/Physical Resilience (5.6%), Low Mental/Social Resilience (12.9%), Low Social Resilience (24.9%), and High Resilience (56.5%). The Low Mental/Physical Resilience class, which faced the highest mental risk, was notably distinguished by its members being younger, essential workers, and having children at home. Socially vulnerable groups, such as females and those with lower income, were more likely to be part of the Low Mental/Social Resilience and Low Social Resilience classes. Different groups of US adults may exhibit varying profiles of physical, mental, and social resilience during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings may help inform policies and interventions for mental health in future global health crises like COVID-19. During such crises, mental health support should be prioritized to essential workers and socially vulnerable groups, while accessible childcare services may particularly benefit parents who work.",

    "title": "From fitness to flourishing: culturally grounded implementation of the PERMAH model in Philippine physical education.",
    "abstract": "Disruptions in education caused by natural disasters, conflict, or global crises pose significant challenges for educators, particularly in physical education (PE), where embodied learning and social interaction are essential. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the wellbeing of both students and teachers became a central focus of educational recovery. While the PERMAH model of wellbeing has garnered international attention, this study contributes to the growing body of work by exploring how it may take shape within culturally specific and resource-constrained educational contexts. This qualitative study examined how Filipino PE teachers implemented the PERMAH model-Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, and Health-to support college students transitioning from online to in-person learning. Two focus group discussions were conducted with 13 instructors from a Philippine public university, all of whom taught parallel PERMAH and non-PERMAH PE classes. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret participant narratives through the lens of Filipino psychology. Four key themes were generated: (1) creating meaningful connections, reflecting teachers' efforts to rebuild rapport and empathy with students; (2) nurturing safe spaces, demonstrating how they fostered emotional and physical safety in the classroom; (3) cultivating enjoyment and engagement, describe how they promote active participation and enthusiasm; and (4) enhancing teaching fulfillment, reveal how they developed their wellbeing and sense of professional purpose while incorporating PERMAH in their classes. This study presents one of the first culturally grounded applications of PERMAH in a Global South context. The findings suggest that locally adapted wellbeing frameworks, such as PERMAH, may help reframe PE as a more relational and meaningful space, offering insights that can inform curriculum design and educational reform.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection may result in complications including congestive heart failure (CHF). It is vital to identify factors associated with CHF post COVID so as to improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether baseline low alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are associated with new diagnosis of CHF following infection with COVID-19. The study was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Meuchedet Health Fund database. The analysis was performed on all subjects aged 18 years and older who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had ALT levels measured prior to infection. Patients were excluded if diagnosed with congestive heart failure or cirrhosis prior to COVID-19, or if they died within 30 days of SARS-CoV-2 contraction. The study endpoint was a new diagnosis of CHF as recorded in the subject's electronic medical record. 131,953 adult patients infected with COVID were included in the cohort. Of them, 205 patients (0.16%) were diagnosed with CHF following COVID-19 infection. The occurrence of CHF was significantly higher in the low ALT group (0.34% vs. 0.14%, p- value < 0.001). This difference was more prominent when analyzing patients aged 50 and older (1.4% vs. 0.35, p-value < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression, pre-morbid low ALT remained significantly associated with the occurrence of post COVID-19 CHF (OR-1.95, 95% CI -1.03 to 2.53). This study demonstrates that low ALT levels prior to infection with COVID-19 is associated with a new diagnosis of CHF following infection. Patients with low ALT levels prior to COVID-19 infection should have cardiovascular complaints post COVID carefully assessed.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma infections have increased globally, including in Japan. Severe pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) that is resistant to macrolides has been reported in the post-COVID-19 period, but its pathogenesis and detailed treatment regimens are still unclear. Four adult cases of M. pneumoniae pneumonia that required admission to the hospital in the 2024-2025 season are presented. Case 1: a 17-year-old male without a specific medical history who was admitted with pneumonia with a severe dry cough. Mycoplasma. pneumoniae genes were detected by multiplex PCR from his sputum. The patient's condition improved with minocycline and corticosteroids for 5 days. Case 2: a 88-year-old man with acute kidney injury who was admitted with severe respiratory failure. Mycoplasma antigen was detected in his pharyngeal swab. He received lascufloxacin drip infusion with corticosteroids for 10 days, and soon improved. Case 3: a 38-year-old woman with maxillary carcinoma and a history of aplastic anemia who was admitted with a severe cough. Mycoplasma antigen was detected in her pharyngeal swab. She received minocycline and corticosteroid drip infusion for 1 week, and finally improved. Case 4: a 74-year-old man with multiple systemic atrophies who was admitted with a severe cough and dyspnea. Mycoplasma antigen was detected from his pharyngeal swab and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was isolated from his sputum. The patient was diagnosed with co-infection with mycoplasma and MSSA. He was treated with sulbactam/ampicillin drip infusion and oral administration of minocycline for 2 weeks, and improved. All hospitalized adult patients with mycoplasma pneumonia were treated with antibiotics, such as minocycline and fluoroquinolone, along with corticosteroid co-administration, and all of them ultimately improved, although the chest X-ray findings varied. Antibiotics other than macrolides and corticosteroids may be an effective regimen for the treatment of severe mycoplasma pneumonia with potential macrolide resistance.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition has a direct impact on infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rates, which are prime indicators of the health status of a country. COVID-19 has also substantially affected the nutritional status of children. Hence, the objective is to highlight the magnitude of malnutrition and associated maternal factors in rural areas of Rajkot district. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2021 to May 2022 among children up to six years of age registered in the Anganwadi centers (AWCs) of Rajkot district. To achieve the desired sample size of 504, a multi-stage sampling method was used. Statistical significance for all comparisons was based on the Chi-square test and factors with P value <0.05 were considered for binary logistic regression. For nutritional status assessment, a Z-score was obtained using WHO Anthro 2011 software. Out of the total 504 participants, 50.2% were female and 49.8% were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.43 ± 18.7 months Prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting was found to be 39.1%, 36.7%, and 30.5%, respectively. After adjustment by binary logistic regression, a significant correlation was found between different forms of malnutrition and the age of participants, education of the mother, type of family, socio-economic class, mother's age at the birth of participants, and birth weight. (P < 0.05). The prevalence of acute malnutrition (wasting) is higher than the national, state, and regional average in this study. Thus, more emphasis should be given to better utilization of services such as nutritional supplementation, nutritional rehabilitation, and growth monitoring along with treatment of morbidities.",

    "abstract": "Millions of Canadians contract enteric illnesses each year, many of which are acquired during, or are otherwise associated with, international travel. As the number of Canadians travelling fluctuates throughout the year, a corresponding change in the number of travel-acquired enteric illnesses was expected. A change in the number of travel-acquired enteric illnesses was also expected during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. This study aims to explore trends in the number and distribution of select travel-acquired enteric infections in Canada, from May 2017 to April 2023. To evaluate trends, Student's t-tests and negative binomial regression modelling were conducted. Percent changes and relative risks were calculated to assess the impact of the pandemic on travel-acquired enteric illnesses. Findings demonstrated a seasonal peak in the number of reported travel-acquired enteric illnesses during the winter and spring pre- and post-pandemic travel restrictions (May 2017-February 2020 and September 2021-April 2023). Additionally, there was a decrease in the number of travel-acquired enteric illnesses added to enteric illness travel clusters with cases in more than one province or territory (multi-jurisdictional) during and after the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, cases reported post-travel restrictions had a higher risk of being added to a multi-jurisdictional enteric illness travel cluster compared to the pre-travel restriction phase. Nonessential travel restrictions and changes in the healthcare-seeking behaviours due to the pandemic likely account in part for the change in the number of travel-acquired enteric illnesses observed while travel restrictions were implemented and after they were lifted. Further research is required to explain the increased risk of illnesses being added to multi-jurisdictional enteric illness travel clusters after the lifting of travel restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Dialysis patients experience a high rate of hospitalizations for infection. This work aimed to study the frequency of hospitalizations for infections and the associated risk factors in a nationwide dialysis cohort during 2019-2020. This was an observational, retrospective study using two national databases. We included 59 585 patients undergoing dialysis from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Hospitalization rates (per 1000 patient-years) were calculated from all hospital discharges with a principal or related diagnosis of infection. Infections were classified into 14 categories. The association between individual risk factors and incidence of infection-related hospitalizations was estimated with multilevel Poisson models with patients as random effects. The incidence rate was 245 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 242-249) hospitalizations per 1000 patient-years, 241 (236-246) and 249 (244-254) in 2019 and 2020. After excluding COVID-19-related hospitalizations, the 2020 incidence was 197 (192-201). The main source of infection-related hospitalizations was pulmonary [93 (91-96)] followed by sepsis [33 (32-34)], digestive excluding peritonitis [25 (24-26)], cutaneous [24 (23-26)], urinary [18 (17-19)], and osteoarticular [9 (8-9)]. Except for pulmonary infection lower in 2020, attributed to barrier measures and lockdowns, there were no major discrepancies in incidence between 2019 and 2020. The main factors associated with risk of infection were male gender; low albumin level; presence of diabetes, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, and lower-limb arteritis; cirrhosis stage; walking disability; and presence of active cancer. The risk of infection-related hospitalization was increased for patients with tunneled catheters and arteriovenous grafts and those under peritoneal dialysis compared with patients with arteriovenous fistula [1.63 (95% CI 1.52-1.76), 1.30 (1.11-1.53) and 1.73 (1.53-1.96); all P < .001]. The risk of hospitalization for infection is high in dialysis patients, which calls for intensified prevention measures. Lockdown and shielding barriers were efficient to decrease the incidence of pulmonary infections but not other infections.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic reintroduced single-fraction radiotherapy for symptomatic bone metastases due to its efficiency, rapid realization, and cost-effectiveness. However, pain flare can occur as a side effect that can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. With pain flare incidence ranging between 2% and 44%, there are no definitive conclusions about which patients are at greater risk. This study aims to analyze the occurrence of pain flare in relation to age, patient's performance status, primary tumor, histopathology, and bone localization of metastases. Our clinical, prospective, non-randomized study included 64 patients with non-complicated, painful bone metastases who underwent palliative, pain-relieving 8 Gy single-fraction radiotherapy in a single hospital visit. Response to treatment was patient-reported via telephone interview using a visual analog scale and assessed based on the international consensus panel of radiation oncologists. In the entire group of patients, 17% developed pain flare. No statistically significant difference was observed in pain flare occurrence depending on the patient's age, performance status, the primary origin of the tumor, histopathology, or location of the metastasis (bone) that was irradiated. All but one patient had a good response to treatment after the flare. Pain flare can be expected in less than 20% of patients receiving 8 Gy single fraction radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. It is not proven that any of the mentioned clinical parameters influence the occurrence of pain flare. Pain flare does not interfere with response to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Calixarenes are a structurally versatile class of macrocyclic compounds that exhibit broad functionality across pharmaceutical, analytical, industrial, and environmental domains. Their conformational flexibility and functionalize upper and lower rims facilitate selective host-guest interactions, enabling their use in targeted drug delivery systems with demonstrated antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer efficacy. In analytical chemistry, calixarene-based sensors have been integrated into colorimetric, fluorometric, potentiometric, and voltammetric platforms, offering high selectivity and low detection limits for analytes such as metal ions, nucleotides, and neurotransmitters. Advances in medical imaging have leveraged calixarene derivatives to enhance MRI contrast and specificity. Their strong chelating capabilities and environmental stability support their application in water purification and soil remediation. Commercial developments, including green leather tanning agents, anti-corrosion coatings, and COVID-19-era antiviral coatings, highlight their real-world potential. Furthermore, computational and AI-driven molecular modeling approaches have facilitated rational calixarene design by predicting binding affinities, dynamic conformations, and interaction energies. While promising, considerations such as low intrinsic solubility, scale-up limitations, and dose-dependent cytotoxicity require further exploration for clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of calixarenes, emphasizing their evolving role as supramolecular platforms in next-generation scientific and industrial innovations.

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 outbreak hit the world forcing public institutions to rethink their core functioning. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were particularly at risk for negative mental health outcomes, given their direct exposure to many pandemic-related stressors. Our study aimed to assess the psychological outcomes of French HCWs during the Covid-19 pandemic, including PTSD, depression and burn-out. This study presents the baseline data of a large cohort study conducted during the pandemic. Participants were 849 French HCWs (mostly single women, working as nurses) assessed for PTSD with the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), for depression with the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), and for burn-out and compassion satisfaction with the ProQOL (Professional Quality of Life). Other pandemic-related variables were also collected, including characteristics related to participants' Covid-19 experience, as well as psychological and clinical measures. The prevalence rates of PTSD, moderately severe depression, and high risk for burn-out were 17.7% (n = 146), 14.0% (n = 118) and 0.9% (n = 7), respectively. Further, findings suggested that working conditions were challenging, though they still found pride in their work. Univariate analyses showed that being a woman, not being a physician, and lacking protective equipment were each associated with higher scores on several negative psychological outcomes (PTSD, depression, burn-out and secondary traumatic stress), though not consistently across all dimensions. Notably, satisfaction scores on the ProQOL did not differ by gender and were higher among physicians. In the multivariate analyses, not being a physician was independently associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression and burn-out symptoms. Being a woman was independently associated with increased PTSD symptom severity. Higher levels of positivity-defined as a general tendency to view life and experiences with an optimistic and constructive outlook, as measured by the Positivity Scale-were associated with lower symptom scores across all three psychological outcomes. This study highlights the considerable psychological toll of the Covid-19 pandemic on French HCWs, particularly among nurses and women, and underscores the protective role of individual psychological resources such as positivity. As one of the largest cohort studies conducted during the pandemic in France, it provides critical evidence to guide public health strategies, institutional policies and mental health interventions. The findings emphasise the urgent need to strengthen occupational mental health support systems and to promote resilience-building approaches among healthcare professionals facing prolonged crisis conditions.",

No standardised diagnostic or treatment pathway is yet available, though a holistic, person-centred approach to symptom management is recommended. The LC Optimal Health Programme (LC-OHP) is a psychoeducational programme designed to support the mental and physical health of people with LC. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of delivering the LC-OHP to people with LC. This was a feasibility randomised controlled trial of the LC-OHP conducted across the UK. Adults diagnosed with LC were recruited and randomised to control (usual care) or to intervention (LC-OHP) groups; follow-up questionnaires were completed at three- and 6-months (December 2021 to May 2023). Sixty participants were recruited with a completion rate of 83% (n = 50). Most participants in the LC-OHP group completed programme sessions (n = 19, 68%), rated the programme positively (n = 23, 87%); and felt that it had potential to improve health outcomes (n = 42, 70%). Initial findings demonstrate improvements across all variables at 3- and 6-months, and more so for the LC-OHP group than the control group in the short-term. Findings support the feasibility of delivering the LC-OHP to people with LC. Further, initial data demonstrate potential for the programme to improve most outcomes at three and 6 months. Data from this feasibility trial will be used as an evidence base to support a fully powered RCT of the LC-OHP on patients with LC. The LC-OHP programme was adapted from the original OHP. Taking into account the various symptoms that people with LC experience, including fatigue and brain fog, public members were not directly involved in the design of the study; however, several approaches were considered to obtain ongoing support from public members while conducting the study, to suit people with LC. This included consulting with practitioners who care for people with LC and implementing their feedback, implementing prior feedback from patients with other chronic health conditions who used the OHP in previous studies, and collecting and implementing feedback from participants receiving this programme in this study. Additionally, two public members with lived LC experience were members of the data management committee that overviewed the study progress and provided continuous support. Public members and practitioners provided advice and guidance on different aspects related to the LC-OHP programme and to the process of delivering it to study participants. This included making the programme concise, visual, colourful, and more user-friendly, and adjusting and adapting the mode and timing of delivering the programme sessions (i.e., reduce the session duration, use convenient delivery methods) as preferred by study participants.

Vaccine-induced allergic reactions, though rare, have made it difficult to ensure complete coverage of COVID-19 vaccination. Initial guideline issued by the Government of India contraindicated vaccination in those with food or drug allergies. Allergic reactions largely result from excipients such as polysorbate 80 (P-80) (present in COVISHIELD™) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [present in the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines]. The present study was carried out with the objective of allergy testing in those with a history of allergic diathesis to generate objective evidence to the extent of true allergies to COVID-19 vaccination. After approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee, written informed consent was obtained for this prospective, open-label study in 100 participants. Allergic response assessment in participants with a history of any allergies, yet unvaccinated to COVID-19, or have taken the first dose and were due for second dose, or had taken the second dose and were due for the precautionary dose, was done by skin prick test (SPT) followed by intradermal testing (IDT) injection with COVISHIELD™ vaccine, P-80, and PEG individually. Based on the result of the skin test (either positive or negative), participants were given advice regarding vaccination. Of the 100 enrolled participants, n = 75 had taken both doses of any COVID-19 vaccine, n = 15 had taken only the first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, and n = 10 were yet unvaccinated. There was no [0/92 (0%) and 0/98 (0%)] positive test with PEG and P-80, respectively. Only 02/98 (2.04%) returned a positive test with full strength (1:1) COVISHIELD™ vaccine IDT but not with SPT. This study indicates a low risk of allergy to PEG, P-80, and COVISHIELD™. Where feasible, allergy testing and counseling can be offered to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals with a history of allergic diathesis.",

Data were collected from April 2022 to February 2023 using one-on-one in-depth interviews with nine nurses working in COVID-19-designated hospitals; these data were analysed using content analysis. This study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines. The five categories were: encountering barriers between nurses and patients, the conflict between principles and dignity, providing individualised care even under controlled circumstances, providing care in a therapeutic community relationship and desiring stable care even in a crisis. This study examined nurses' challenges and experiences in delivering person-centred care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the conflict between infection control guidelines and individual patient needs, nurses sought to address patients' psychological and physical challenges while overcoming COVID-19 together, leading to satisfaction for both patients and nurses. Systemic support and education are essential to sustain person-centred care, and this study provides valuable insights for improving nursing practice in crisis situations.

    "title": "Outcomes of Virtual Versus Physical Psychiatric Admissions: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Telepsychiatry is an effective alternative to in-person care in many settings. However, evidence is lacking on clinical outcomes when telepsychiatry is used to deliver virtual inpatient psychiatric care. This study compared clinical outcomes of patients virtually admitted with outcomes of those physically admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with transfer from virtual to physical admission were also investigated. Data for this retrospective cohort study (N=1,579 patients) were extracted from electronic health records. Admissions were coded as physical or virtual. Outcome measures were treatment response, length of stay, and time to readmission or death within 6 months of discharge. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for confounding. Outcomes were analyzed by using logistic and Cox regressions. In 2021, a total of 214 patients were virtually admitted and 1,365 were physically admitted. The virtual admission group had significantly lower odds of treatment response (OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.41-0.81), longer lengths of stay (hazard ratio [HR]=0.83, 95% CI=0.71-0.97), and faster times to readmission or death (HR=2.11, 95% CI=1.52-2.93). Lower socioeconomic status, personality disorder or personality difficulties, history of suicide attempt or deliberate self-harm, and lack of insight into need for treatment were associated with a greater likelihood of transfer from virtual to physical admission. Patients virtually admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic had worse outcomes than patients who were physically admitted. Postpandemic research should further evaluate the effectiveness of virtual psychiatric wards and identify patient characteristics associated with outcomes of such novel services.",

Study sample: A group of 22 (Group A) and a group of 25 (Group B) SIS patients participated. Data collection and Analysis: The isometric force of shoulder internal and external rotation was measured using only K-Muscle Controller (group A, two measurements with K-Muscle Controller) or both instruments (group B, one measurement with each instrument). The Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) test was used to investigate the reliability and validity of the K-Muscle Controller. The Coefficient of Variation (CoV) was also calculated for both shoulders' internal and external rotation of both groups. Furthermore, Bland-Altman plots were used to present the level of agreement between the measurements for both groups. Results: Intraclass correlation tests revealed high correlation coefficients for validity (ICCs ranging from 0.957 to 0.986) and for reliability (ICCs ranging from 0.944 to 0.986) for both groups and both arms for K-Muscle Controller. Moreover, CoV showcased values ranging from 31.77% up to 48.57%. Bland-Altman plots showed that data were within the limits of agreement indicating strong relationship between measurements without any observed trend. Conclusions: K-Muscle Controller was deemed reliable for measuring the shoulder's external and internal strength in both healthy and pathological shoulders.",

We used US Cancer Statistics (USCS) to describe potential impacts of the pandemic on cancer incidence for persons 0-39 years. We used data from USCS, covering 98% of the US population, to evaluate cancer case counts, incidence rates, and monthly counts; incidence rate ratios were calculated comparing year 2019 (baseline) to 2020 and 2021. We calculated trends using joinpoint regression for the period 2003-2021. Comparing 2019 with 2020, cancer incidence decreased 5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3%-7%) for ages 0-19 years and 7% (95% CI, 6%-8%) for ages 20-39. For ages 0-19, decreases were seen for thyroid cancer, melanoma, and nonmalignant central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms. For ages 20-39, decreases were seen for leukemias, lymphomas, CNS neoplasms, sarcomas, melanoma, and some carcinoma types. Decreases in 2020 were least pronounced for the distant stage at diagnosis. For ages 0-39, new diagnoses were lowest during March or April 2020 but returned to prepandemic levels during the second half of 2020. Decreases in 2021 were consistent with previously decreasing trends for many cancer types. Cancer rate decreases were largest for young adults (vs. children) and were significant for some cancer types. These findings might help assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, inform investigations into potential causes of these decreases, and guide responses to future public health crises.",

    "abstract": "The study classified motivational teaching profiles and examined whether they differed significantly in terms of satisfaction, loneliness, and affects. The sample consisted of 315 teachers working in Spanish educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mage = 41.95; SD = 10.18; 33% male), who completed the following online questionnaires: the Work Tasks Motivation Scale, the Teaching Satisfaction Scale for Teachers, the Affective Balance Scale, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The results revealed two profiles: (a) an average intrinsic motivation profile, characterized by average intrinsic motivation and identified regulation, and low levels of introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation; and (b) a high amotivation profile, characterized by low intrinsic motivation, low identified and introjected regulation, but high external regulation and amotivation. MANOVA analyses revealed significant differences between the profiles in terms of loneliness (F = 29.76; η² = 0.80), teaching satisfaction (F = 102.75; η² = 0.24), positive affect (F = 12.28; η² = 0.30), and negative affect (F = 63.19; η² = 0.16). Teachers in the average intrinsic motivation profile (a) reported higher levels of teaching satisfaction and positive affects, as well as lower levels of negative affects. However, contrary to previous findings, they also reported higher levels of loneliness. In conclusion, the study identified two distinct motivational profiles among teachers, associated with significant differences in loneliness, teaching satisfaction, and affective balance. The findings underscore the importance of further research and targeted interventions, particularly to support male and older teachers experiencing low motivation.",

    "abstract": "Following three years of complex negotiations, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body announced consensus among Member States on 16 April 2025, leading to the adoption of the Pandemic Accord at the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly on 19 May 2025. The accord aims to address the systemic inequities and failures exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by enhancing early detection and rapid response capacities, promoting equitable access to pandemic-related health products, and ensuring sustainable financing for pandemic activities. This commentary highlights why the accord is of critical importance to Africa and describes the strategic options for its effective implementation on the continent. Africa, with its unique pandemic vulnerabilities and weaknesses in global health security capacities, stands to gain the most from the Pandemic Accord. The continent faces challenges such as high-threat pathogens, weak health systems, political instability, and limited domestic financing. Additionally, Africa's low capacity to influence global negotiations and fragmented public health governance complicates the implementation of global health agreements. To overcome these challenges, eleven priority recommendations are proposed, including joint analysis and domestication of the accord's provisions, strong political commitment, better alignment of regional and global health security initiatives and public health organizations, leveraging digital technologies, prioritizing local manufacturing, and community engagement. We urge African stakeholders to collaborate in ensuring the transformation of the accord from a global commitment into meaningful pandemic prevention and control action for the continent.",

    "abstract": "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the rates and severity of anorexia nervosa (AN) leading to rises in admissions for medical stabilization. To improve care and effectively allocate limited resources, we need a better understanding of the factors that lead to prolonged hospitalization in patients with AN. We performed a retrospective chart review of 139 adolescent and young adult patients admitted a combined 196 times for medical instability due to AN at a large pediatric hospital in the Midwest region of the United States. We used multiple linear and Poisson regression modeling to look for differences in length of hospital stay and reimbursement rates based on payor type (public vs. private), while controlling for demographic and clinical factors which may impact length of stay. We then looked at hospital charges and reimbursement rates by payor type, using two-sided t-tests. Multiple regression models demonstrated that patients with public insurance tended to have a longer length of stay, despite similar degrees of medical instability. Reimbursement rates were significantly and substantially less from public insurance companies compared to private. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining length of stay and reimbursement rates for medical stabilization based on insurance status. Understanding the effects of a tiered insurance scheme on both clinical and fiscal outcomes will be key to improving care provided to patients with AN. Anorexia nervosa is a severe eating disorder which often leads to medical complications due to rapid weight loss and malnutrition. When patients become medically unstable, they are admitted to medical hospitals, where they are treated for conditions such as severely low heart rates or blood pressures, acute kidney injuries, electrolyte deficiencies, or abnormal heart rhythms. Once medically stable, patients are discharged with the intent of comprehensive eating disorder treatment, which includes medical follow-up and psychological care. In the United States, access to such comprehensive care is determined largely by geography and a patient’s health insurance coverage. A substantial gap exists between patients with private (provided or subsidized by an employer, directly purchased by patients and families, military-sponsored care) and public (Medicaid, government-funded, “safety net”) insurance. Our study found that patients with public insurance are hospitalized longer than patients with private insurance, despite having a similar baseline illness severity. Lack of access to post-hospital comprehensive care is a likely contributor. Longer hospitalizations can be disruptive to families, place significant financial strain on the families and hospital systems, contribute to school absenteeism, and contribute to provider burnout. We hope that the findings of our study inform economic and political discussions toward eating disorder health care equity, while acknowledging the financial strains on the health care system. For real progress, we need to advocate for more post-hospitalization and outpatient therapeutic services for those with public insurance.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) poses considerable issues, notably in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study is to assess the differences in incidence rates and clinical outcomes of OHCA in Telangana, India, between the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods, focusing on factors that influence survival rate. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patient records from a Telangana district hospital of those who presented to hospitals after OHCA from 2019 to 2021. The data were analysed to determine OHCA outcomes and factors that influence survival. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages, were used to summarise the categorical variables. The data were analysed to assess a significance level of p < 0.05. Appropriate statistical. methods, such as chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests, were used to analyse quantitative variables. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined to analyse the precise distribution of variables across three time periods. The number of OHCAs increased during the pandemic. The first wave accounted for 1,452 cases (31.34%), and the second accounted for 1,368 cases (29.53%), whereas there were 1,284 cases (27.72%) during the pre-pandemic period. The initiation rate of CPR dropped from 81.2% before the pandemic to 30.19% during the first wave and 49.02% during the second wave. Bystander-initiated CPR declined significantly. CPR was performed by laypersons in just 3.94% of cases during the first wave compared to 8.42% pre-pandemic. The time from OHCA to initiation of CPR was also significantly prolonged, with > 20-minute delays increasing from 15 to 80.3% during the first wave. ROSC rates remained tremendously low across all periods, with survival noted in just 0.26% of cases pre-pandemic and 0% across both waves of the pandemic. These findings highlight the severe impact of delayed emergency response and limited access to advanced care, as evidenced by the lack of ROSC during the epidemic. These. results demonstrate the value of early CPR and trained bystanders in the outcomes of OHCA. Individuals without this information should also be made aware of the ongoing need for public awareness and continued training in CPR, rapid EMS response times, and greater use of AEDs, especially in the context of revised guidelines and recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, to ensure that survival rates in such cases are improved.",

    "abstract": "Elevated serum amylase has been frequently observed in COVID-19 patients, but whether hyperamylasemia results from a direct or indirect pancreatic effect or other mechanisms remains debated. Our study aimed to investigate the association between hyperamylasemia, pancreatitis, and COVID-19 severity. We retrospectively analyzed 1858 patients who visited the emergency department of Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli-IRCCS in Rome during the first two years of the pandemic. All had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and underwent serum amylase evaluation. Clinical and laboratory data, including oxygen therapy requirements, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, were extracted from electronic medical records. Univariate analysis revealed a correlation between hyperamylasemia and blood urea nitrogen, ICU admission, multiple comorbidities, and D-dimer levels. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and blood urea nitrogen, confirmed that ICU admission-but not in-hospital mortality-was independently associated with hyperamylasemia. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in only four patients. Elevated serum amylase levels appear more related to disease severity than direct pancreatic involvement. Emergency physicians should recognize that hyperamylasemia detected upon emergency department admission in COVID-19 patients may indicate an increased risk of ICU admission rather than acute pancreatitis, warranting closer evaluation and management.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is most often mild and resembles that of seasonal coronaviruses. Profiling the adaptive immune response following infection may help to inform on the protective mechanisms mediating immunity in children and adults. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses from unvaccinated pediatric and adult participants were analyzed following non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific T cell memory responses were investigated by quantifying interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secreting cells after stimulation with ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human β-coronaviruses (HCoV)-OC43 and -HKU1. Twenty-eight children (3-17 [median = 10] years) and 28 adults (19-62 [median = 42] years) were sampled at a mean time of 7 months (±2.8 months) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody levels against spike (S) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD), as well as neutralization capacity, were equivalent in adults and children. However, children displayed a lower number of IFN-γ secreting T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults, with a median of 88 [28-184] spot-forming units (SFU) per million of cells in children compared to 208 [141-340] in adults (P < 0.001). In children, the IFN-γ+ responses to SARS-CoV-2 were of similar magnitude as the responses to seasonal β-coronaviruses (P > 0.05). In contrast, adults exhibited heightened T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 than they did to HCoV-OC43 (median of 80 [45-135] SFU/106 cells, P < 0.0001) and HCoV-HKU1 (median of 98 [59-151] SFU/106 cells, P < 0.01). In children, the functional T cell memory responses to SARS-CoV-2, assessed through IFN-γ secretion in response to peptide stimulation, are comparable to those of HCoVs and lower compared to adults. While binding and neutralizing antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 are largely comparable in children and adults, the strength of memory T cell responses induced by infection is reduced in children compared to adults. Adults present heightened cellular memory responses to SARS-CoV-2, but not to seasonal β-coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In contrast, children's T cell memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 closely mirror their response to common seasonal β-coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Traditional investigations of viral infection mechanisms have predominantly relied on two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models, which lack the structural organization and physiological relevance of native tissues. These systems often fail to capture key features such as spatial cell-cell interactions, tissue-specific heterogeneity, and microenvironmental complexity that govern virus-host dynamics in vivo. To address these limitations, we established an integrative platform that combines the strengths of both 2D and three-dimensional (3D) models to investigate the role of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3), a membrane ferrireductase, in regulating viral infection in human intestinal epithelium. The 2D system enabled high-resolution mechanistic interrogation of STEAP3-dependent viral entry processes, while the patient-derived 3D colon organoid model recapitulated the architectural and cellular complexity of intestinal tissue, allowing spatially resolved assessment of infection patterns. Using this integrated approach, we found that STEAP3 knockdown significantly increased viral entry and infection, particularly in enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells. To further mimic physiological conditions in human body, we developed a vascularized organoid-on-chip model, in which increased viral signals were observed within vascular lumens upon STEAP3 depletion, suggesting a protective role of STEAP3 in limiting viral dissemination. For efficient and multiplexed screening of antiviral mechanisms, we also fabricated a 3D-printed 27-well chip tailored for organoid culture. By leveraging the complementary advantages of both 2D and 3D systems, this study demonstrates the power of integrated biomimetic modeling platforms to investigate antiviral defense mechanisms and underscores their value for engineering physiologically relevant infection models.",

    "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is growing evidence that the social epidemiological context may play a crucial role in the adoption of health protective behaviours in response to emerging infectious diseases. Yet, our understanding of how and why these behaviours are influenced by the epidemiological forces remains relatively limited. This repeated, cross-sectional investigation examines the extent to which the association between the socio-epidemiological context and protective behaviour was mediated by a series of common social cognitive factors from leading models of health behaviour during the COVID-19 epidemic in France. Representative samples of the French population completed an online, self-report survey at seventeen intervals (March-November 2020), with approximately 2000 participants in each survey wave. Results indicate that both contextual and social cognitive variables largely drove the adoption of protective behaviours over time. However, social cognitive variables only partially mediated the effect of the epidemiological context on protective behaviour (physical distancing and hygiene measures), suggesting that unknown factors may be operating in addition to those commonly used in these models. These findings highlight the need for future research to consider the epidemiological context, and further possible mediating variables, when modelling determinants of social cognitions and preventive behaviour, and above all, to broaden its focus to include neglected underlying psychological mechanisms involved in the behavioural response to epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections caused by pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae pose significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical symptoms, particularly during seasonal outbreaks. Conventional single-pathogen tests and commercial multiplex PCR kits are often costly, time-consuming, and lack flexibility for resource-limited settings. To address these limitations, we developed a novel fluorescence melting curve analysis-based (FMCA-based) multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of six respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), M. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human adenovirus (hADV). The method was evaluated for its limit of detection (LOD), precision and specificity before clinical validation, followed by a prospective single-center study in patients with presumptive acute respiratory infections. Analytical validation revealed high sensitivity with limits of detection (LOD) between 4.94 and 14.03 copies/µL, exceptional precision (intra-/inter-assay CVs ≤ 0.70% and ≤ 0.50%), and no cross-reactivity. Clinical evaluation using 1005 samples demonstrated 98.81% agreement with RT-qPCR, identifying 51.54% pathogen-positive cases, including 6.07% co-infections. The assay resolved 12 discordant results via sanger sequencing, confirming superior sensitivity in low viral load scenarios. With a turnaround time of 1.5 h and a cost of $5/sample (86.5% cheaper than commercial kits), this scalable platform enables high-throughput screening during outbreaks. Our findings highlight its potential as a cost-effective, rapid diagnostic tool for differentiating respiratory pathogens, guiding clinical management, and enhancing surveillance in diverse healthcare settings. Further adaptations to include emerging variants and sample types could strengthen global preparedness for respiratory epidemics.",

    "abstract": "We combine daily internet search data and monthly information on medical expenditures for anti-depressants to test two distinct hypotheses in eight Australian states, covering the period from 2020 to 2022. First, whether using daily search data can help predict future demand for health services; and second, whether nowcasting and machine learning models yield better predictions vis-à-vis autoregressive forecast models. Our aim is to assess the use of such data and techniques to improve the planning and possible deployment of health resources across space. We find that search data contain information that is valuable for predicting the demand for health services in the short-run, and that machine learning models yield predictions with lower mean square error. Both results support the use of daily search data and machine learning tools to enhance the provision of health services across locales.",

    "title": "Patients' perspective about synchronous teleconsultation with a general practitioner: a mixed-method systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Synchronous teleconsultations using video or phone have become an increasingly popular method for delivering healthcare, especially in primary care. This modality enhances access to care, particularly for individuals in remote or underserved areas, and was especially significant during disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these benefits, patient perspectives on teleconsultations with general practitioners (GPs) remain underexplored. Factors such as consultation type, convenience, and technology influence patient satisfaction and acceptance, but concerns persist about the effectiveness of remote consultations for complex cases. This systematic review explores patients' use, attitudes, experiences, satisfaction, and preferences regarding synchronous teleconsultations with GPs, aiming to identify factors influencing the choice of teleconsultation over face-to-face consultations. The review included 46 studies published until March 2023, sourced from PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library, following PRISMA guidelines. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were analyzed, representing diverse contexts. Findings reveal that patient satisfaction with teleconsultation is influenced by consultation purpose, convenience, technological capabilities, and continuity of care. Video consultations are preferred over phone consultations, particularly for follow-ups and routine issues. Teleconsultation is seen as less effective for complex consultations requiring physical exams. Patient characteristics, including age, socioeconomic status, and technology familiarity, impact acceptance. Privacy concerns, data security, and diagnostic accuracy remain significant barriers. Continuity of care is better maintained when teleconsultation involves established patient-GP relationships. The review emphasizes the need for hybrid care models and policies aligned with patient preferences, focusing on accessibility, technology, and privacy safeguards. Future research should address barriers for vulnerable populations and equitable access.",

    "abstract": "Presenteeism, the act of working while unwell, presents serious risks to both workers and organizations, especially in healthcare, where it directly affects patient-care quality. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these risks, particularly for healthcare workers facing increased workload pressure. Although the impact of presenteeism on workers has been widely studied, a critical gap remains in our understanding of how its patterns have shifted over time. Therefore, this study examined presenteeism trends using the Korean Working Conditions Surveys (2010-2023), focusing on healthcare workers and the effects of age and sex before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that presenteeism peaked in 2014, declined sharply in 2020, and reached its lowest level by 2023. Healthcare workers exhibited high presenteeism rates prior to the pandemic; however, during and after the pandemic, these rates decreased rapidly and ultimately became lower than those of non-healthcare workers. Older and female healthcare workers showed higher presenteeism (i.e., were more likely to work while ill), and these trends persisted even after the pandemic. These findings underscore the need for sex- and age-sensitive workplace interventions for healthcare workers to promote healthier work environments and mitigate the risk of presenteeism.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is widely used to manipulate gene expression and integrate transgenes into specific target sites, making it a powerful tool for recombinant protein expression. In this study, we generated a single donor cassette for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in at either the αAmy3 or αAmy8 locus in rice cells. The transgene was inserted downstream of the promoter and first exon of the rice αAmy3 or αAmy8 genes, which are highly expressed under sugar-starved conditions in rice suspension cultures. We constructed a simple vector with the homologous intron sequences of the αAmy3 and αAmy8, along with rice codon-optimized recombinant receptor binding domain (rcRBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a functional domain responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells. Using this construct, rcRBD was successfully integrated into the intron 1 of either the αAmy3 or αAmy8 genes. As a result, rcRBD expression was driven by endogenous αAmy3 or αAmy8 promoter-signal peptide. Under the control of αAmy3-signal peptide, rcRBD proteins was detected in both the soluble cellular protein fraction and culture medium, whereas expression driven by the αAmy8 promoter-signal peptide was exclusively detected in the culture medium of rice suspension cells. The highest secreted protein yield of rcRBD in the rice culture medium under the control of αAmy8 endogenous promoter reached 20.7 mg/L, demonstrating a production efficiency comparable to that driven by the endogenous αAmy3 promoter.",

The participants included 189 elementary school teachers, with a mean age of 41.41 years. They completed an online questionnaire that included the VTD scale and three main sections: 1) job information, 2) voice history, and 3) history of COVID-19. We extracted the frequency and severity of VTD symptoms and examined the relation of various factors with them. A cross-sectional study. The mean of VTD frequency and severity subscales were 10.58 (±10.59) and 10.39 (±10.63), respectively. The highest frequency and severity symptom was \"dry\" with an average of 2.01 (±1.85) and 1.95 (±1.81), respectively. The \"inflammation\" showed the lowest frequency (1.02 ± 1.41) and the \"aching\" indicated the lowest severity (1.03 ± 1.47). Some factors, including disturbing environmental conditions during VT, technical issues created during VT, voice self-assessment, vocal complaints, vocal habits, voice or larynx problems at the time of the study, and history of COVID-19 and following voice problem had significant relation with the frequency and severity of VTDp (P < 0.05). This study indicates that VT does not significantly relate with the discomfort sensations experienced in the vocal tract by teachers. However, certain issues arising from VT or Coronavirus infection and some factors related to voice history were associated with the experience of VTD. If these secondary problems are addressed and teachers are trained to manage their voice habits effectively, they may experience less VTD.",

Herein, we focus on the latest reports on COVID-19 and explain what preventive measures are necessary in the workplace, taking into account the route of virus infection. Although droplets and airborne exposure are the main infection routes, contact infection cannot be overlooked. Infection prevention measures include the uses of natural and mechanical ventilation, air conditioning equipment, and masks as well as the recommendation of vaccination, all of which have reported effectiveness However, since indoor environments vary, we do not recommend preventive control through any one measure alone. Instead, implementing infection control by using a combination of measures is important for adaptation to various situations.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported lung function impairment following COVID-19. Less is known about the subsequent recovery. What is the recovery in lung function after COVID-19 during the first year after infection? We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that monitored individuals' lung function from the time of infection to at least 1 year after infection. Primary outcomes were change in percent predicted forced expiratory volumes in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D LCO). Mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random effects model. We included 23 studies (n=3347 participants). 20 (86.9%) studies had their first follow-up 3 months after infection and 21 (91.3%) had their second follow-up 12 months after infection. The MDs between the second and first follow-up visits of FEV1, FVC and D LCO were 3.1% (95% CI 1.8-4.5; p<0.01), 4.4% (95% CI 2.7-6.0; p<0.01) and 6.6% (95% CI 4.4-8.9; p<0.01), respectively. Recovery of FEV1, FVC and D LCO was greater in mechanically ventilated patients compared to individuals with less severe disease. Current smoking status, pre-existing chronic lung disease and age did not impact recovery during the first year after infection. Recovery in lung function was evident during the first year after COVID-19, with the largest improvement in patients with the most severe infection. Further follow-up and large-scale studies are warranted to establish recovery trajectories of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections to identify patient subgroups needing additional follow-up to ascertain modifiable factors influencing pulmonary recovery.",

This retrospective, multicenter study was conducted across 15 Japanese medical institutions during the 11th wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 via rapid antigen testing between July 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024, were enrolled. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The data of 408 patients were available for analysis; including 42.6 % were 40-59 years of age, 61.5 % female, and 35.8 % had a history of COVID-19. Seven doses of vaccine were associated with a significantly lower maximum body temperature and shorter fever duration (-0.79 °C, p < 0.001, and -1.50 days, p < 0.001, respectively). Past infection was associated with a significantly lower maximum body temperature and shorter fever duration (-0.35 °C, p < 0.001, and -0.75 days, p < 0.001, respectively). The symptoms in patients with past infection were significantly fewer at days 7, 14, and 30 than were those without past infection. For patients vaccinated seven times, symptoms were fewer after day 14. No significant difference was observed in the interval between onset and the last vaccination. Repeated COVID-19 vaccination, particularly seven doses, was correlated with a lower maximum body temperature and shorter fever and symptom duration for patients during the 11th wave dominated by KP.3 variant. These findings highlight the importance of repeated vaccinations to mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 with emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 7 million worldwide deaths, but the mechanisms underlying its severe clinical outcomes remain elusive. Although attachment of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a pivotal step for infection, induces inflammation, the intracellular signals triggered by this interaction are unclear. Here, we found that S protein induced phosphorylation of SMAD family member 5 which was mediated by the bone morphologenetic protein (BMP) receptor activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and BMP receptor type II. SMAD5 activation depended on the interaction of the cytoplasmic domains of ACE2 and ALK1. Notably, repetitive treatment with S protein increased the expression of immune-response genes, including interferon regulatory factor 1, interleukin-17A, and cysteine-cysteine chemokine motif ligand 20 (CCL20), all of which were blocked by an ALK inhibitor. In contrast, the S protein of human coronavirus NL63, a pathogen of acute respiratory infection with less severity than SARS-CoV-2 that also binds to ACE2, did not activate SMAD5. Because CCL20 recruits multiple immune cells positive for CC receptor 6, a specific receptor for CCL20, and was detected in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of patients with respiratory failures by SARS-Cov-2, data suggest that SMAD5 activation by S protein augments the early immune response, leading to the severe clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes severe respiratory and neurologic disease, and there are currently no licensed vaccines or approved treatments. The acute respiratory disease caused by NiV is associated with severe inflammation, similar to severe COVID-19. Dexamethasone is an affordable and widely available synthetic glucocorticoid, that improved outcomes when administered to patients with severe COVID-19. To determine whether a similar beneficial effect could be achieved during NiV infection, we tested the effect of an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive dose of dexamethasone on NiV in the Syrian hamster model. We found that dexamethasone treatment produced the expected hematologic changes in uninfected animals in a dose-dependent manner. In NiV-infected animals, the anti-inflammatory dose of dexamethasone reduced pulmonary pathology, while the immunosuppressive dose had no effect. The anti-inflammatory dose did not increase virus replication in tissues or virus shedding from the respiratory tract, indicating the anti-inflammatory dose of dexamethasone does not result in increased virus replication. Despite reduced lung pathology, dexamethasone treatment did not increase survival after NiV challenge. When dexamethasone treatment was combined with the antiviral remdesivir, dexamethasone negated the increased survival observed in hamsters treated with remdesivir alone. Our study provides critical information on the effect of dexamethasone administration on the outcome of NiV infection and cautions against the use of dexamethasone in combination with other antivirals like remdesivir without preclinical validation.",

    "abstract": "Non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), the largest multifunctional membrane-associated protein encoded by coronaviruses, contains a papain-like protease (PLpro) domain that cleaves viral polypeptides at the nsp1/nsp2, nsp2/nsp3 and nsp3/nsp4 junctions, as well as host substrates such as polyubiquitin chains and ISG15. While host substrate recognition by PLpro is well characterized, the processes by which PLpro identifies and interacts with membrane-associated viral substrates remains poorly defined. In this study, we developed full-length nsp3-containg reporter constructs to investigate PLpro-mediated cleavage in a membrane context. Our results show that differential cleavage sensitivity at nsp2/3 nsp3/4 junction in response to protein expression levels: nsp2/3 cleavage occurred even at low expression levels, whereas efficient nsp3/4 cleavage required high protein dosage, suggesting a reliance on trans-cleavage for the latter. Mutagenesis and structural analysis based on the recently resolved nsp3-4 complex structure suggest that membrane constraints on the substrate, along with positional and conformational requirements of the PLpro domain for cis-cleavage, contribute to the trans-cleavage preference at the nsp3/4 site. Membrane localization and specific protein-protein interactions further facilitate this trans-cleavage process. To assess nsp3/4 cleavage in a more physiologically relevant context, we developed a cleavage-induced degron (CID) system that mimics authentic viral polyprotein processing. This system generates a binary signal upon cleavage at the nsp3/4 junction and response to inhibition by the PLpro inhibitor GRL-0617. Our findings reveal that the domain arrangement of nsp3 dictates trans-dependence of the nsp3/4 cleavage, involving membrane association and protein interactions that may facilitate the subsequent double-membrane vesicle assembly.",

We conducted a retrospective methodological study of all CAs included in the COVID-19 SRNMA until May 19, 2024. We assessed trial characteristics, reporting quality using CONSORT-A, and consistency with full-text publications. We also compared meta-analyses with and without CAs at predefined time points for mortality and hospital length of stay, evaluating changes in effect and GRADE domains. We included 105 CAs; 53% (56/105) were linked to a full publication. Only 7% met high reporting standards. Average consistency with full-text publications across key methodological items was 67.6%, often due to missing details in both sources. CAs enabled meta-analyses that would not have been possible at 14% of time points. Their inclusion did not affect conclusions when using the null threshold but changed the effect estimate in 55.6% and imprecision ratings in 16% of cases when using minimally important differences. In a few instances, CAs also influenced risk of bias and inconsistency assessments. CAs can fill evidence gaps when data are limited or emerging. Although they rarely change conclusions based on the null threshold, their inclusion has greater impact when using MID. Reviewers should assess their inclusion case by case and promote better reporting practices to enhance their contribution to SRs.",

Diversion of IFN signaling is associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells.

However, the optimal treatment strategy for anastomotic leakage remains controversial. This case involves a 55-year-old male patient with esophagogastric junction cancer who experienced intrathoracic anastomotic leakage following esophagojejunostomy, exacerbated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related immunodeficiency. Following conservative therapy, the patient had a right-sided empyema, necessitating thoracoscopic pleural decortication on postoperative day (POD) 35. A T-tube was inserted at the anastomotic site, and its short limb maintained stability within the lumen, facilitating fistula formation. Postoperatively, the patient's body temperature and inflammatory markers gradually returned to normal. Oral intake was resumed on POD68, and the T-tube was removed on POD79. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on POD96. In this patient with COVID-19 infection and systemic sepsis, T-tube drainage facilitated fistula formation and ensured continuous decompression at the anastomotic site, contributing to successful conservative management. T-tube drainage may be an effective and feasible treatment option for intrathoracic anastomotic leakage in patients with severe immunodeficiency.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and tolerability of anticancer drugs may be affected by several factors that change with age. No specific trials of cabozantinib have been conducted in older patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The CABOMAYOR study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy in terms of objective response rate in previously untreated fragile older patients with mRCC. An exploratory, phase 2, single-arm study was conducted in patients who were ≥ 70 years with a risk of frailty or who were > 75 years regardless of frailty, had a diagnosis of mRCC with measurable disease, had an ECOG-PS of 0-2, and had not received previous treatment for mRCC. Cabozantinib was orally administered once daily at a dose of 40 mg for 28-day cycles, which could be increased to 60 mg to prevent suboptimal exposure. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Other outcomes included progression-free survival, overall survival and adverse events. Thirty-eight patients were screened, and 24 patients were included in the study. Patients had a median age of 78 years (interquartile range [IQR] 75-81), and 12 (50%) had a Geriatric-8 score equal to or less than 14 points (i.e., risk of frailty). The median duration of follow-up was 27.0 (16.6-47.1) months. There were no confirmed complete responses, and seven patients achieved a confirmed partial response, thus leading to an ORR of 29.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0-47.4%). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.0-3.6) months and 33.7 (95% CI: 20.5-46.8) months, respectively. Fourteen (58.3%) patients required dose reductions, and 17 patients (70.8%) required dose interruptions, mostly due to nonhematologic toxicity. Most of the adverse events were grade 1-2 events. There were three grade 5 adverse events, none of which were considered treatment-related: these events included physical health deterioration, cerebral hemorrhage, or COVID-19-related pneumonia. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (45.8%) patients, three of which were considered treatment-related. Our results suggest that cabozantinib is effective as an initial monotherapy for older patients with mRCC with a toxicity profile consistent with that reported in younger adults.",

The anti-COVID-19 potential of active compounds was assessed through enzyme activity assays and molecular docking, followed by validation in cellular and animal models. Data mining revealed that Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Lonicera japonica Thunb. and Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl were the high-frequency herbs used in COVID-19. Five potential 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors were screened from three herbs via AUF and identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Further enzymatic and cellular assays demonstrated that Licochalcone C (LCC) and Forsythiaside A (FTA) inhibited Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication at micromolar concentrations. Notably, FTA treatment significantly suppressed the elevation of pulmonary parameters and inflammatory mediators induced by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in mice. In summary, this study proposes a novel strategy integrating data mining with AUF to discover active compounds from TCM. Two components, LCC and FTA, were identified as dose-dependent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strain replication in vitro.",

    "title": "Supporting dialogue amongst multicultural communities: Exploring the role of vaccine champions.",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccination has significantly reduced the risk of severe disease. Yet, across many settings in Australia, there have been issues with equitable uptake, particularly for some people from ethnic minority backgrounds. To bridge this gap, training workshops were held to support the capacity of local community leaders to communicate about the COVID-19 booster vaccines and other recommended vaccines as local vaccine champions. This study aimed to explore participants' vaccine and communication knowledge and the acceptability and perceived usefulness of the Vaccine Champions Program. The training included information about eligibility for the COVID-19 booster vaccines and the rationale for their continued use, information about other vaccines recommended for adults, as well as recommended travel vaccines. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted from July to December 2023. Attendees of the workshop were purposefully selected to identify as leaders of multicultural communities in Sydney, with expressions of interest being offered to all attendees to participate in the evaluation of the workshop through a semi structured interview. They contributed their insights on the development and implementation of the training workshop sessions, participants' views on becoming vaccine champions, and the improvements needed for future sessions. Interviewees emphasised the importance of providing reliable information in the training to address vaccine hesitancy. They highlighted the significance of the training in boosting their confidence to promote and champion vaccination within their community, and suggested incorporating personal stories, testimonies, and interactive elements to enhance the training package. They expressed positive views on the program's continuation beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasising the importance of their knowledge of vaccines remaining current with research and adapting communication approaches. Continued collaboration between community leaders and healthcare providers, ongoing training, and staying current with research are essential for ensuring the program's long-term sustainability, self-efficacy, and impact on public health outcomes.",

    "title": "COVID-19 hoax belief endorsement and its implications for vaccine uptake: Investigating the role of perceived threat.",
    "abstract": "Belief that COVID-19 was a hoax has been associated with lower vaccine uptake, potentially due to reduced perceptions of disease threat. Using longitudinal data from a community sample (N = 1058), we tested whether perceived threat mediated the relationship between hoax belief and vaccine uptake, and whether this relationship varied by level of perceived threat. Counterfactual mediation analysis indicated that hoax belief predicted lower vaccine uptake in part through diminished perceived threat. However, hoax belief also had a direct negative effect on vaccine uptake-but only when perceived threat was low. These findings highlight the dual role of perceived disease threat, functioning both as a mechanism linking belief to behavior and as a contextual factor shaping the strength of that association. Recognizing this nuance in the effects of conspiracy belief endorsement is critical for developing public health communication strategies that are credible in content and effective across ideological divides.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of flow path geometry on Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 biofilm structure, on different surface materials. A custom- experimental setup featuring vertically oriented millimeter-scale-flow channels was employed to grow biofilms on test coupons made of stainless steel electropolished (SSEP) and Teflon fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP), at 72 h after flow onset under constant flow conditions. Each flow channel accommodated an upstream and a downstream coupon placed in a row. Two channel types were employed: (i) one with a straight flow path throughout, and (ii) one with an upstream straight section and a downstream square-wave (zig-zag) flow path. Biofilm thickness and structure were quantified using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images analyzed by a novel, in-house Matlab software. Results demonstrated that SSEP consistently supported thicker and more uniform biofilms compared to FEP. In straight channels (type i), biofilms on SSEP reached mean thicknesses of approximately 29 ± 9 μm (upstream) and 46 ± 17 μm (downstream), while FEP showed thinner biofilms (19-20 μm, COV ≈ 47 %). In square-wave channels (type ii), thicker biofilms developed on the upstream surfaces, with thicknesses of 86 ± 14 μm (COV ≈ 17 %) for SSEP and 81 ± 34 μm (COV ≈ 42 %) for FEP, respectively. Furthermore, biofilms on SSEP increased further along the downstream zig-zag path, indicating enhanced accumulation due to flow geometry. This effect was absent on FEP, where detachment occurred in certain zig-zag sections. Overall, the findings emphasize the critical interplay between surface properties and flow dynamics in shaping biofilm structure.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant limitations in existing data infrastructure, particularly the lack of systems for rapidly collecting, integrating, and analyzing data to support timely and evidence-based public health responses. These shortcomings hampered efforts to conduct comprehensive analyses and make rapid, data-driven decisions in response to emerging threats. To overcome these challenges, the US National Institutes of Health launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative. A key component of this initiative is the RADx Data Hub-a centralized, cloud-based platform designed to support data sharing, harmonization, and reuse across multiple COVID-19 research programs and data sources. We aim to present the design, implementation, and capabilities of the RADx Data Hub, a cloud-based platform developed to support findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) data practices and enable secondary analyses of the COVID-19-related data contributed by a nationwide network of researchers. The RADx Data Hub was developed on a scalable cloud infrastructure, grounded in the FAIR data principles. The platform integrates heterogeneous data types-including clinical data, diagnostic test results, behavioral data, and social determinants of health-submitted by over 100 research organizations across 46 US states and territories. The data pipeline includes automated and manual processes for deidentification, quality validation, expert curation, and harmonization. Metadata standards are enforced using tools such as the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) Workbench and BioPortal. Data files are structured using a unified specification to support consistent representation and machine-actionable metadata. As of May 2025, the RADx Data Hub hosts 187 studies and over 1700 data files, spanning 4 RADx programs: RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP), RADx Radical (RADx-rad), RADx Tech, and RADx Digital Health Technologies (RADx DHT). The Study Explorer and Analytics Workbench components enable researchers to discover relevant studies, inspect rich metadata, and conduct analyses within a secure cloud-based environment. Harmonized data conforming to a core set of common data elements facilitate cross-study integration and support secondary use. The platform provides persistent identifiers (digital object identifiers) for each study and supports access to structured metadata that adhere to the CEDAR specification, available in both JSON and YAML formats for seamless integration into computational workflows. The RADx Data Hub successfully addresses key data integration challenges by providing a centralized, FAIR-compliant platform for public health research. Its adaptable architecture and data management practices are designed to support secondary analyses and can be repurposed for other scientific disciplines, strengthening data infrastructure and enhancing preparedness for future health crises.",

    "title": "How Does Household Food Insecurity Impact Complementary Feeding, in High Income Countries, in a Cost-of-Living Crisis? A Systematic Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Complementary feeding, when infants are introduced to solid foods, is an important stage of learning new tastes, textures and eating behaviours. Austerity, post-BREXIT (in the UK) and the COVID-19 pandemic have created a cost-of-living crisis, exacerbating prevalence of food insecurity in high-income countries. Understanding how this may impact upon parents' experience of complementary feeding is important. This systematic scoping review therefore examined how food insecurity impacts diet and feeding practices during the complementary feeding period for infants aged 6-18 months. Four electronic databases were searched, identifying 5822 articles. 3293 titles and abstracts, from which 30 full texts were screened by two independent reviewers. The final review included five articles (two qualitative and three quantitative). Three articles were conducted in Australia, one in America, one in New Zealand with 1044 parent/child dyads in total. Strategies such as encouraging children to finish their food, avoiding foods that might not be accepted and reducing food variety were common. These strategies may ensure children are fed but may reduce elements of complementary feeding that we know are important such as exposing infants to wide varieties of tastes, textures and nutrients and adopting a responsive feeding style. The sparsity of evidence in this review, particularly for research based in the UK, highlights the need for further research in high-income countries to explore the impact of household food insecurity on complementary feeding. This will help to identify priorities for those working in policy and practice to support families with complementary feeding during the cost-of-living crisis and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Airborne transmission of pathogens has emerged as a significant public health concern amid recurring pandemics. While conventional air filtration can capture bioaerosols, it poses risks of re-emitting pathogens, necessitating long-term air sterilization. Here, we developed a photo-regenerable antimicrobial air filter by grafting Cu clusters onto a titanium dioxide nanotube mesh (CuxO/mTNT, 1 < x < 2). The in situ grown tubular nanotubes on the mesh support provide a high surface area, and the dispersed Cu clusters exhibited superior disinfection activity. The filter achieved rapid inactivation of Gram-negative Escherichia coli (4.80-log reduction) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (2.58-log reduction) and respiratory viruses including Influenza A virus (H1N1) and Human coronavirus 229E within minutes. While Cu-based nanomaterials induce antimicrobial effects through direct contact, they gradually lose efficiency as Cu(I) species oxidize to Cu(II). When Cu clusters are grafted onto TiO2, the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) allows for the absorption of visible light and the formation of charge carriers. The Cu clusters dispersed onto the TNT continuously regenerate Cu(I) under mild visible light through IFCT, achieving sustained recovery of the antimicrobial efficiency. Integrated into a commercial air purifier, the CuxO/mTNT filter achieved efficient space disinfection of bioaerosols, showed reversible photo-regeneration over 10 cycles, and maintained durability for over six months. Field tests demonstrated that this filter achieved disinfection efficiency, whereas conventional filtration-based filters left microbial residuals, which could pose hazards to human health.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant vulnerabilities among patients who are immunocompromised, who remain at increased risk for severe disease despite widespread vaccination in the general population. This commentary reviews insights from Dorry L. Segev's, MD, PhD, keynote lecture at MedNews Week, highlighting reduced vaccine efficacy, prolonged viral shedding, and increased severity of COVID-19 in this population. Emerging strategies such as monoclonal antibody prophylaxis, oral antivirals, personalized vaccine approaches, and T cell-based therapies show promise in mitigating these risks. Additionally, the commentary discusses the implications of hybrid immunity and the potential for within-host viral evolution to generate resistant variants, underscoring the need for targeted genomic surveillance. Ethical considerations are raised regarding the use of advanced oncologic treatments with marginal survival benefits but substantial toxicity in the context of COVID-19 vulnerability. To effectively protect immunocompromised patients, tailored public health measures, dedicated vaccination programs, and integrative lifestyle interventions are required. Synergistic efforts among clinicians, researchers, and policy makers are essential to ensure equitable access to preventive and therapeutic strategies, strengthening health care resilience for vulnerable populations during the ongoing pandemic and beyond.",

In this study, in silico tests were conducted on diterpenic compounds found in copaiba oil to evaluate their interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SC2Spike). Molecular docking, electrostatic potential maps (MESP), and frontier orbital analysis (HOMO-LUMO) were performed using GaussView and MVD®. Pharmacokinetic predictions revealed favourable absorption profiles for copaic, cativic, and eperruic acids.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted adolescents' lives, leading to increased stress and anxiety rates globally. Although existing research highlights the necessity of understanding the increased rates of anxiety in adolescents during and after the pandemic, it offers little insight into the risk and protective factors for the development of adolescent anxiety at this time. To more deeply understand how the pandemic impacted anxiety in adolescents around the world, the current study adopted a qualitative approach to synthesising the global evidence on adolescents' lived experiences of anxiety during the pandemic. Five databases (Academic Search Complete, British Education Index, Education Research Information Centre, APA PsycINFO, and Scopus) were searched for studies that included qualitative data reported by adolescents on their lived experiences of anxiety during the pandemic. After duplicate records were removed, 348 records were title and abstract screened, a shortlist of 117 publications for full text screening, resulting in 34 papers to be included in the review. Thematic analysis of data uncovered adolescents' experiences of anxiety during the pandemic in relation to a wide range of risk factors (i.e., academic stressors, family and economic stressors, social isolation, online dangers, uncertainties and health-related concerns) and protective factors (e.g., social support, personal coping, accurate information and clear guidelines, digital tools) in different developmental contexts. These findings can guide the development of effective practices and policies for young people navigating the complexities of the post-pandemic world.",

The purpose of this study was to identify these models of care and provide suggestions on best practices that could be integrated into LTCHs in efforts to improve resident care. The project included a quantitative survey and semi-structured key informant interviews with LTCH managers across Canada. Our objectives were to 1) identify models of care that were used to support resident care in Canadian LTCHs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to describe their intervention components, processes of implementation, and perceived impact; 2) determine whether LTCHs planned to sustain models of care implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the most frequently reported models of care were related to healthy food options, exercise, music and art programs, and planned social activities for residents. Five barriers were identified in relation to implementing these models of care, which included: lack of funding, resources, or staffing; staff not being familiar with/reluctant to use the model; lack of resident buy-in; fear of COVID-19; and pandemic regulations. Common facilitators to implementation were also identified and included: staff support; resident/family buy-in; funding, legislation and/or resources provided; familiarity with model prior to COVID-19; and collaboration with other LTCHs. LTCHs perceived the models to be effective and planned to sustain most implemented models. LTCH managers discussed the need for funding and legislation to improve LTCHs and support the implementation of promising models of care. This study provides insight into the models of care implemented during the pandemic crisis period in Canadian LTCHs, how effective they were perceived to be, and plans for sustainment beyond the pandemic period.",

    "title": "Turning challenges into opportunities: Lessons from Ethiopia's COVID-19 response for strengthening health systems and health security.",
    "abstract": "Emerging in late 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak rapidly evolved into an unprecedented global public health crisis. While exposing critical health system weaknesses, the pandemic also spurred innovation and investment, including rapid vaccine development. This paper examines Ethiopia's multi-tiered health system response, exploring the strategies, enabling conditions, barriers, and lessons learned. We conducted a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study across all tiers of Ethiopia's health system from August to December 2023. Data came from three concurrent components: a quantitative survey of implementers (n = 952), key-informant interviews (n = 80), and administrative data. An additional 233 health workers were surveyed to assess intervention integration. Study tools were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and WHO pillars. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data underwent framework analysis, followed by synthesis and triangulation. Results show Ethiopia rapidly expanded laboratory capacity, increasing RT-PCR sites from one (February 2020) to 72 (June 2020), and developed genomic sequencing. Critical care capacity grew, supported by the acquisition of over 764 oxygen concentrators, 320 mechanical ventilators, and remote workforce training. Rapid vaccine deployment and cold chain expansion facilitated over 68 million people receiving at least one dose. The country gained valuable experience in community engagement and deployed over 3,000 rapid response teams. While initial political will and engagement were strong, it waned over time. Consequently, despite efforts to integrate and institutionalize, some key interventions-including surveillance, laboratory testing, and case management-declined as the pandemic's urgent phase passed and political engagement diminished. In conclusion, the Ethiopian health system gained experiences and tools in critical care, laboratory testing, rapid vaccine deployment, and community engagement. If institutionalized and sustained, these capacities can significantly strengthen Ethiopia's health system and enhance its resilience. To fully integrate and institutionalize these platforms for future emergencies, robust monitoring is essential.",

    "title": "Residential greenness and reduced depression during COVID-19: Longitudinal evidence from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.",
    "abstract": "Urban greenness has several demonstrated mental health benefits, including lower rates of depression and loneliness. Few studies have evaluated the possible benefits of greenness on depression during the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We investigated this topic using a prospective cohort of Canadian adults. Our study population consisted of 13,130 participants, 50 years of age and older, of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Short Scale (CES-D-10) screening tool was used to determine whether individuals had depression at two-time points (pre-pandemic, and 6 months into the pandemic). Greenness was characterized using the maximum annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (500m buffer) from the pre-pandemic residential address. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of depression during the pandemic in relation to an interquartile range increase in the NDVI. The prevalence of depression increased nearly twofold between the pre-pandemic and pandemic surveys (8.5% to 16.5% for men; 14.4% to 27.1% for women). Irrespective of depression status before the pandemic, those with higher residential greenness had lower odds of depression during the pandemic. Among those 'not depressed' pre-pandemic, the odds ratio (OR) of depression during the pandemic in relation to an interquartile increase in the NDVI (0.06) was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97), while a weaker association was found for those depressed pre-pandemic (OR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.83-1.11). The inverse association between greenness and depression during the pandemic was strongest among those of lower socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest that green spaces in urban areas helped mitigate against depression during the pandemic.",

    "title": "Discovery, phylogenetic, and comparative genomic analysis of novel avian gammacoronaviruses identified in feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica).",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has intensified efforts to identify emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) across diverse hosts. Spillover events, where CoVs transition from wildlife reservoirs to other species, can lead to infections with varying clinical outcomes, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance. Understanding the diversity and distribution of both known and novel CoVs in wildlife reservoirs is crucial for predicting and preventing future spillover events. In this study, we employed Illumina's Pan-CoV library panel and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify five novel avian-associated gammacoronavirus genomes from cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs of clinically healthy feral pigeons captured in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, in 2018. The genome sequences, ranging from 27,582 to 27,611 nucleotides, clustered with gammacoronaviruses in phylogenetic analyses but formed a distinct clade. Comparative analysis of the five conserved domains in the ORF1ab coding sequence with other gammacoronaviruses revealed Pairwise Patristic Distances (PPD) that exceeded both species and subgenus demarcation cutoffs. These findings highlight the critical need for ongoing surveillance to enhance understanding of CoV diversity, host range, and potential for cross-species transmission, aligning with One Health principles. Based on these results, we propose Gammacoronavirus columbae as a new species for these pigeon gammacoronaviruses that clusters with the recently reported duck gammacoronaviruses to form a novel subgenus within Gammacoronavirus.IMPORTANCEAlthough coronaviruses are significant pathogens affecting a wide range of hosts, surveillance efforts have predominantly focused on wild mammals, leaving the diversity of avian coronaviruses largely underexplored. Here, we report the detection of novel gammacoronaviruses from feral pigeons in South Africa and propose revisions to the current taxonomic classification of Gammacoronavirus based on genetic distance analyses. These findings highlight the potential role of wild birds in the dissemination of novel coronaviruses, analogous to their established involvement in the transmission of avian influenza viruses. Our study also highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in uncovering the hidden diversity of viruses in wildlife populations. Finally, this study reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance, continued vigilance, and further research into avian coronaviruses. The ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in the USA have demonstrated the devastating impact of emerging avian viruses on wildlife, agriculture, and public health. Given the unpredictability of coronavirus evolution, failing to monitor their diversity and potential for cross-species transmission risks leaving us unprepared for future outbreaks. This study reinforces the urgent need for proactive, large-scale genomic surveillance of wildlife reservoirs to identify emerging CoVs before they become significant threats to animal and human populations.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To examine prospective associations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positivity, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) symptom severity, and COVID-2019 hospitalization with incident clinical diabetes among aging women. Methods: A cohort study was conducted using data from 34,405 eligible Women's Health Initiative participants who completed ≥1 COVID-2019 surveys (Survey 1: June-December 2020; Survey 2: June 2021-February 2022) and were followed up for an average of 1.86 (±0.49) years, yielding 399 incident diabetes cases. Results: SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was associated with diabetes risk in the age-adjusted Cox regression model (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10, 2.82), but not when fully adjusted (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.88, 2.31). Diabetes risk was higher among those with 1-2 COVID-19 symptoms (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.77) and those with 3± COVID-2019 symptoms (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.22) compared with those without COVID-2019 symptoms in fully-adjusted models, irrespective of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing. COVID-2019 hospitalization was associated with 2-3 times the risk of clinical diabetes in age-adjusted (HR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.52, 5.72) and fully-adjusted (HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 0.97, 3.72) models. Conclusions: Age-adjusted self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was associated with a higher incidence of diabetes. Reporting of COVID-2019 symptoms and being hospitalized for COVID-2019 were each associated with higher incidence of diabetes in aging women, after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health characteristics.",

In a nonrandomized pre/post/follow-up design, clinical outcomes and service use were evaluated for matched comparison (n=77) and intervention (n=80) groups for delirium incidence, accidents/injuries, injury treatment, psychotropic medicines, length of stay, hospital readmissions and discharge destination. Group-level outcomes were monetized and included in a cost-benefit analysis (present value of benefits/present value of education and service costs). Relative to the comparison group, there were significant reductions in intervention group delirium (P=0.001), accidents/injuries (P=0.007), treatment for injuries (P=0.007), psychotropic medicines (P=0.030) and hospital readmission within 30 days (P=0.002). After adjusting for the longer length of stay of the intervention subgroup who contracted COVID-19 (n=10), there were no group differences in length of stay (P=0.83). Per participant service costs for comparison and intervention groups were AU$34,870 and AU$33,969, respectively, equating to a per-participant cost saving of AU$914 (P<0.0001). Investment in person-centered care education of direct care staff is warranted from both clinical and economic perspectives.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 presented numerous challenges to medical professional's mental, emotional, and physical health, including burnout and secondary trauma. As social workers served as essential and frontline workers during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the effects of the pandemic on professional burnout and secondary trauma responses. A multiracial sample of 163 medical social workers working across four hospital settings responded to a survey addressing burnout and the impact of COVID-19. Medical social workers in this sample reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment and moderate levels of depersonalization. Regression analyses found that hyperarousal scores significantly predicted emotional exhaustion, identifying as Latinx and Black significantly predicted depersonalization, and being older and identifying as White significantly predicted personal accomplishment among medical social workers. Resiliency programs can be developed for medical social workers in direct practice to reduce secondary traumatic stress and increase employee well-being. Future research should employ more rigorous research designs to better understand risk and protective factors for burnout among medical social workers providing direct practice to clients and families.",

    "abstract": "In Bangladesh, an extensive enrollment examination is required to enroll in different universities, where students from all 64 districts of Bangladesh compete to get a place. Students either migrate from their home districts to another place or continue from home if they reside in the same city. However, it is undeniable that there is a huge and sudden change in the lifestyle of the newly enrolled students. This study was conducted on 50 universities in Bangladesh to investigate the overall health conditions of the university newcomers (N = 605) in six academic sessions from 2016 to 2022. The study showed that more than half of the students (52.6%) became physically sick after admission. The majority (81.5%) of the respondents felt mental pressure, and the maximum (83.3%) were concerned about their mental health condition, which is often unnoticed for this group of students. This also highlighted that during COVID-19, participants' mental health deteriorated drastically (71.7%). Nevertheless, the medical centers of the respective institutions were completely heedless in the majority (79.3%) of cases. Lastly, the respondents themselves tried to provide appropriate suggestions that will be helpful for the future well-being management of the newcomers. Thus, unveiling the overall health condition of newcomers is necessary so that every respective individual becomes aware of the condition and the current situation changes into a student-friendly and lively environment. To our knowledge, this is one of the first kinds of investigation in Bangladesh.",

Methods for concentrating and enriching viruses in sewage are also rapidly evolving. The magnetic bead method has been widely adopted for nucleic acid extraction due to its simplicity and high efficiency. In this study, we designed three pre-treatment procedures (T1: sedimentation for 30 min; T2: low-speed centrifugation at 2500×g for 5 min; T3: high-speed centrifugation at 8000×g for 5 min) to identify the optimal pre-treatment for enhancing viral nucleic acid concentration efficiency using the magnetic bead method. Spiked recovery tests were employed to compare the concentration efficiency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in sewage between the magnetic bead method and the traditional polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method. Real sewage samples were further used to evaluate both methods for enriching enveloped viruses (SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus) and non-enveloped viruses (Norovirus, Rotavirus, Adenovirus). Results demonstrated that low-speed centrifugation (T2) served as the optimal pre-treatment for the magnetic bead-based concentration. The high-throughput magnetic bead method achieved significantly higher recovery rates for SARS-CoV-2, Norovirus, and Adenovirus compared to PEG precipitation. Thus, the high-throughput magnetic bead method can be widely applied for the concentration and concentration of diverse viruses in sewage.",

    "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or Long COVID is a post-viral complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing ongoing symptoms and impaired function over a prolonged period of time. There is limited understanding of how the signs and symptoms of Long COVID/PASC affect patients' lives and how to measure them, which is essential when developing care strategies. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the content validity for a novel patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument in Long COVID/PASC through qualitative research, which was informed by the patient experience of Long COVID/PASC and both patient and clinician input. A review of literature and PRO instruments developed for Long COVID/PASC identified measurement gaps for the context of use (i.e., weekly assessment of signs/symptoms in clinical trial research). This informed the development of the preliminary Long COVID/PASC PRO instrument, which was tested via patient interviews (combined concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing) to align with regulatory standards, and discussions with clinical experts were conducted to provide clinical insights. The final instrument was modified based on this input to further promote its content validity. Thirty participants were interviewed about their Long COVID/PASC experiences. Participants most frequently reported experiencing tiredness after physical activity (n = 29/30; 97%), general tiredness (n = 28/30; 93%), shortness of breath (n = 25/30; 83%), cough (n = 23/30; 77%) and muscle/body aches (n = 23/30; 77%). All participants reported that Long COVID/PASC had an impact on their health-related quality of life. Almost all (n = 27/28; 96%) sign/symptom concepts were reported in the first three sets of interviews suggesting conceptual saturation was achieved. Items, response options and the recall period of the preliminary Long COVID/PASC PRO instrument were understood as intended (≥ 90%) and relevant to most participants across both rounds (≥ 47%). Modifications were made to the instrument following patient input, resulting in the 18-item Long COVID/PASC instrument. Clinician input (n = 3) corroborated participant interview results, supporting the content validity of the Long COVID/PASC PRO instrument. The Long COVID/PASC PRO instrument has been developed in line with regulatory standards and the qualitative evidence demonstrated strong content validity in a Long COVID/PASC population. Research to evaluate psychometric properties will provide further evidence of the instrument's measurement properties.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted public health efforts for chronic disease prevention (CDP) in Canada and elsewhere. We describe COVID-19-related disruptions in CDP resources and activities among Canadian public health organizations. We surveyed all organizations in Canada with mandates for primary CDP, including \"resource organizations\" that develop or transfer CDP initiatives and \"user organizations\" that deliver these CDP initiatives to target populations. Key informants most knowledgeable about CDP activities and resources within each organization reported pandemic-related changes in CDP resources and activities. User organizations also reported on the status of 18 specific CDP activities and rated whether pandemic containment measures were barriers to or facilitators of CDP activities. Of the 298 participating organizations (88% response), 129 were resource organizations (37% formally mandated organizations [FMOs]; 63% non-governmental organizations [NGOs]) and 169 were user organizations (48% FMOs; 52% NGOs). Overall, 36% reported decreases in CDP funding (24% major, 12% minor), 30%-41% reported decreases in full-time, volunteer and managerial staff (19%-27% major, 11%-14% minor) and 32% reported decreases in CDP activities (23% major, 9% minor). User FMOs were most affected by decreases. Among user organizations, 16%-39% decreased, suspended or discontinued specific CDP activities. Still, 8%-39% increased their activities, particularly those targeting mental health, marginalized populations, racialized communities and specific gender groups. Half (53%) of user organizations perceived COVID-19 contagion restrictions as barriers to CDP activities. Continued monitoring of CDP resources and activities can inform emergency preparedness and ensure that CDP remains a priority during public health crises. La pandémie de COVID-19 a perturbé les efforts de santé publique en matière de prévention des maladies chroniques au Canada et ailleurs. Nous décrivons les perturbations liées à la pandémie de COVID-19 dans les ressources et les activités de prévention des maladies chroniques au sein des organisations de santé publique canadiennes. Nous avons interrogé toutes les organisations canadiennes ayant un mandat de prévention primaire des maladies chroniques, que ce soient les « organisations ressources », celles qui développent ou transfèrent des initiatives de prévention des maladies chroniques, ou les « organisations utilisatrices », celles qui mettent en oeuvre ces initiatives auprès des populations cibles. Les informateurs clés les mieux informés sur les activités et les ressources de prévention des maladies chroniques au sein de chaque organisation ont fait état de changements liés à la pandémie dans les ressources ainsi que dans les activités de prévention des maladies chroniques. Les organisations utilisatrices ont également rendu compte de l’état d’avancement de 18 activités spécifiques de prévention des maladies chroniques et ont évalué si les mesures d’endiguement de la pandémie constituaient des obstacles ou des éléments facilitateurs pour ces activités. Sur les 298 organisations participantes (88 % de réponses), 129 étaient des organisations ressources (37 % d’organisations formellement mandatées, 63 % d’organisations non gouvernementales [ONG]) et 169 étaient des organisations utilisatrices (48 % d’organisations formellement mandatées, 52 % d’ONG). Dans l’ensemble, 36 % ont signalé une diminution du financement de la prévention des maladies chroniques (24 % majeure, 12 % mineure), entre 30 % et 41 % ont signalé une diminution du personnel à temps plein, des bénévoles et des gestionnaires (19 % à 27 % majeure, 11 % à 14 % mineure) et 32 % ont signalé une diminution des activités de prévention des maladies chroniques (23 % majeure, 9 % mineure). Les organisations formellement mandatées utilisatrices ont été les plus touchées par les réductions. Parmi les organisations utilisatrices, 16 % à 39 % ont réduit, suspendu ou interrompu des activités spécifiques de prévention des maladies chroniques. Dans le même temps, 8 % à 39 % ont augmenté leurs activités, en particulier celles ciblant la santé mentale, les populations marginalisées, les communautés racisées et des groupes spécifiques en matière de genre. La moitié (53 %) des organisations utilisatrices ont perçu les restrictions de contagion de la COVID-19 comme un obstacle aux activités de prévention des maladies chroniques. La surveillance continue des ressources et des activités de prévention des maladies chroniques peut contribuer à la préparation aux situations d’urgence et garantir que la prévention des maladies chroniques reste une priorité lors des crises de santé publique. At least one-third (30%–41%) of public health organizations reported decreases in chronic disease prevention (CDP) funding, personnel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Formally mandated public health user organizations had particularly high decreases in CDP resources and activities. There were marked decreases in tobacco control, healthy eating and healthy weight activities. Activities targeting mental health, marginalized populations, racialized communities and specific gender groups increased. More than half of user organizations viewed COVID-19 public health measures as barriers to CDP activities.

    "abstract": "Cancer patients diagnosed early in the COVD-19 pandemic may have been particularly vulnerable due to immunosuppression caused by their cancer. The objective was to assess cause of death due to COVID-19, cancer and other causes among cancer patients during the pandemic. We thus examined causes of death (cancer, COVID-19, other causes) among cancer patients diagnosed in 2020 (N=503,128) compared to 2018 (N=537,006) in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-22. We focused on 1-year cause-specific mortality by cancer type, stage and age at diagnosis. In a counterfactual analysis we estimated the number and proportions of cancer patients dying from cancer or other competing causes if COVID-19 were eliminated as a possible cause of death. Among 2020 cancer patients, 15.8% died from cancer, 3.3% from other causes, and 0.7% from COVID-19. Among those who died, COVID-19 mortality was 9%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 2.8% and 1.2% of all deaths for prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer, respectively. In a counterfactual analysis assuming that COVID-19 had not occurred, similar percentages would have died from cancer or other causes, except for lung and pancreatic cancer. In summary, cancer was the leading cause of death in 2020, but COVID-19 did not have a large influence on competing-cause mortality. These findings inform healthcare strategies to mitigate excess mortality among cancer patients during future healthcare disruptions.",

This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 260 (63.5% women) patients with a mean age of 43.05 (SD = 17.06) years who reported OD of various causes. Olfactory function was assessed using the TDI-Sniffin' Sticks test (mean TDI scores of 22.51 (SD = 8.48)) and OD-related QoL was measured using the Questionnaire of Olfactory Dysfunction Negative Statements (QOD-NS). A random forest model was used to determine the most significant factors for the prediction of overall OD-related QoL impairment. Most influential for the prediction of QoL were food-related QOD-NS statements with Statement 7 (i.e., \"The changes in my sense of smell annoy me when I eat\") being most influential (percentage increase in mean squared error = %IncMSE 16.02) and Statement 14 (i.e., \"Because of the difficulties with smelling, I am scared of getting exposed to certain dangers (e.g., gas, rotten food)\") being least influential (%IncMSE 0.09). We also found significantly better TDI scores (H (9) = 45.31, p < 0.001) in patients with COVID-19-associated OD compared to posttraumatic, congenital, and iatrogenic OD. OD-related QoL seems to be predominantly affected by food-related difficulties rather than other factors, highlighting the importance of food for patients with OD and the important role of patients' subjective perception of the sense of smell when assessing QoL.",

The study sample included 426 individuals who had contracted SARS-CoV-2 and presented with changes on the tongue. Periodic checkups enabled to determine their variability and duration in response to treatment or lack thereof. The presence of various oral manifestations was reported, including strawberry tongue (women (F): 143; men (M): 65), depapillation (F: 86, M: 156), geographic tongue (F: 65, M: 124), vascular changes (F: 102, M: 46), aphthous changes (F: 106, M: 58), candidiasis (F: 89, M: 57), edema (F: 42, M: 52), herpetic lesions (F: 38, M: 49), ulcers (F: 38, M: 46), erosions (F: 32, M: 28), nodular lesions (F: 6, M: 19), and necrotic changes (F: 9, M: 7).

In the majority of cases, the changes disappeared on their own and persisted from 4 weeks to 36 months. In 20% of cases, they recurred. Local therapy resulted in a 50% reduction in the duration of PCS. Changes that manifest on the tongue require observation and basic or specialized treatment. In the absence of pain, monitoring is recommended for a period of 4 weeks, after which a spontaneous disappearance should be expected. In the event that various changes occur in the oral cavity, the patient should be referred for specialized treatment.",

A fomite workshop with experts was convened in November 2024 by academia, several government agencies, and public health officials to evaluate existing data and discuss how to mitigate risks. Fomite transmission is influenced by the nature of the built environment, population density and proximity, environmental factors (humidity, heat, etc.), virus survival, surface type, engineering controls (ventilation, physical barriers, etc.), and human behaviors. Based on our current data, direct contact with a contaminated surface/fomite, even for respiratory viruses, presents a risk of viral exposure and transmission by both contact with the fomite and resuspension in the air. Even respiratory viruses can be resuspended from fomites following human and pet movement, activities (e.g., vacuuming, toilet flushing, etc.), or changes in ventilation/indoor airflow. After resuspension from surfaces, microbes can be potentially inhaled (contributing to droplet and/or aerosol exposure) and/or re-deposited from primary to secondary fomites. Development of standard methods (molecular, chemical/physical, and infectivity assays) for detecting the presence of viruses on fomites and human behavior modeling would help to determine the most effective infection prevention strategies.",

    "title": "DAZAP2 functions as a pan-coronavirus restriction factor by inhibiting viral entry and genomic replication.",
    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the emergence of novel variants underscore the need to understand host-virus interactions and identify host factors that restrict viral infection. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify host restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2, revealing DAZAP2 as a potent antiviral gene. DAZAP2, previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 restriction, is found to inhibit viral entry by blocking virion fusion with both endolysosomal and plasma membranes. Additionally, DAZAP2 suppresses genomic RNA replication without affecting the primary translation of viral replicases. We demonstrate that DAZAP2 functions as a pan-coronavirus restriction factor across four genera of coronaviruses. Importantly, knockout of DAZAP2 enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse models and in human primary airway epithelial cells, confirming its physiological relevance. Mechanistically, the antiviral activity of DAZAP2 appears to be indirect, potentially through the regulation of host gene expression, as it primarily localizes to the nucleus. Our findings provide new insights into the host defense system against coronaviruses and highlight DAZAP2 as a potential target for host-directed antiviral therapies.IMPORTANCEDuring viral infection, the host defense response is mediated by a variety of host factors through distinct mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated. Although DAZAP2 was previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 restriction, its mechanisms of action and in vivo relevance remain unclear. In this study, we identify DAZAP2 as a potent pan-coronavirus restriction factor that inhibits viral infection through dual mechanisms: blocking virion fusion with both endolysosomal and plasma membranes, and suppressing genomic RNA replication. We confirm its physiological relevance in host defense using mouse models and primary cell cultures. This study advances our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Targeting DAZAP2 or its regulatory pathways could provide a new approach to enhance host defense against current and future coronavirus threats.",

    "abstract": "The American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) framework quantifies cardiovascular health. Prior studies have focused on individuals without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). We sought to examine recent trends in LE8 scores among older adults with prevalent CVD. We included noninstitutionalized older US adults (ages 65+) from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-18). Overall LE8 scores (range 0-100; higher is better cardiovascular health) were calculated for all participants. CVD diagnoses were self-reported, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction. Percent change in LE8 scores from 2013 to 2018 was calculated for each diagnosis group, and a linear regression tested for significance of changes within groups. The 3050 participants represented 37 908 305 US adults (54.7% women; mean age 72.6). LE8 scores tended to stay stable or decline between 2013 to 2014 and 2017 to 2018 for those with and without CVD. Significant decreases in mean LE8 scores occurred in those with hypertension, with a 4.1% decline (from 59.6 to 57.1 [P<0.01]); stroke, with an 11.5% decline (from 60.6 to 53.6 [P=0.01]); and heart failure, with a 15.2% decline (from 60.9 to 51.6 [P<0.001]). LE8 scores remained stable or declined for older US adults before the COVID-19 pandemic. Populations with hypertension, stroke, and heart failure had significant LE8 score declines. Because LE8 metrics include behavioral and physiologic metrics associated with CVD risk, these data indicate concerning trends and primary and secondary prevention opportunities in older US adults, who are at highest risk for incident and recurrent CVD events.",

    "abstract": "As a day-active species, humans abstain from some or all foods and beverages and rest at night. The modern social clock diverged from the natural light-dark clock with far-stretching consequences for both fasting/eating and sleep/wake daily cycles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged social restrictions (SR) offered a quasi-experimental protocol to directly test the impact of the relaxed social clock on eating and sleep behaviors and the coupling between them. Using data from a global survey of 5,747 adults (mean age 37.2±13.7, 67.1% females, 100% worked/studied), we show that relaxation of the social time pressure during social restrictions led, on average, to a 42 min increase in the habitual fasting duration (FD, interval between the last and the first meal) (from 12:16±2:09 to 12:57±2:04) and a 34 min delay in the fasting window. FD was extended by lengthening both the pre-sleep fasting and sleep durations. Pre-SR breakfast eaters delayed sleep and fasting, while breakfast skippers delayed sleep and advanced meals. Stopping alarm use on workdays was associated with a larger increase in FD. The correlations between chronotype, FD, and the mid-fasting time became more robust during SR. We conclude that relaxed social time pressure extends habitual fasting duration and promotes co-alignment of daily fasting and sleeping. Given the finding that the sleep-fasting phase relationship during social restrictions remained stable, we suggest that a 'daily sleep-fasting structure' may be a novel circadian marker quantifying the coupling between daily rhythms. These results may inform strategies of public circadian health management.",

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic inequalities can affect vaccine acceptability and the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. To investigate income inequality in willingness to vaccinate and identify its determinants in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Hamadan City, Islamic Republic of Iran, in February and March 2021. It collected data from 864 respondents using a structured questionnaire and analysed them using Stata version 14. Logistic regression was used to assess the effects of covariates on willingness to vaccinate within income groups and a multivariate decomposition technique was applied to evaluate the factors influencing willingness to vaccinate across groups. We found that 39.2% of the participants were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccination. Fewer participants in the low-income group than those in high-income group (33.5% vs 49.1%; P < 0.001) were willing to accept the vaccination. Female sex, having elderly family members and witnessing COVID-19-related deaths among relatives were primary contributors to the willingness to accept vaccination. In contrast, being employed, previous COVID-19 infection and holding a bachelor's degree had the main contradictory effects on the inequality of willingness to vaccinate. The differences in income level among the participants affected their willingness to vaccinate. There is therefore a need for targeted interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and vaccination effectiveness among the different income groups within the study population. عدم المساواة في الدخل والاستعداد لقبول التطعيم ضد كوفيد-19 في جمهورية إيران الإسلامية. وََجِِيهة رََمِِضاني دُُرُُح، نََسيم بََدِِيعي، م ريم خُُرََّمْْ رُُوز. يمكن أن تؤث ر أوجه عمد المساواة الاجتماعية والاقتصادية على مدى مقبولية اللقاحات وفعالية ربامج التطعيم. هدفت هذه ال رداسة الى الوقوف على العلاقة بين عمد المساواة في ال خدل والاستعداد لقبول التطعيم ضد كوفيد-19 في جمهورية إي ران الإسلامية. أُُ رجيت هذه ال رداسة المقطعية في مدينة همدان، بجمهورية إي ران الإسلامية، في فب راي ر/ شباط ومارس/ آذار 2021. وجمعت رداسة بيانات من 864 مستجيبًًا، وحللتها باستبيان مُُنظََّم والإصدار 14 من نربامج STATA، على التوالي. واستُُخمد الانحدار اللوجستي لتقييم آثار المتغي رات المشاركة على الاستعداد للتطعيم دا خل فئات ال خدل، وأسلوب التحليل التفكيكي المتع دد المتغي رات لتقييم العوامل التي تؤث ر على الاستعداد للتطعيم بين الفئات. تبين أن 39.2% من المشاركين كانوا على استعداد لقبول التطعيم ضد كوفيد-19. وكان عدد المشاركين الذين كانوا على استعداد لقبول التطعيم أقل في فئة ال خدل المنخفض مقا نرة بفئة ال خدل الم رتفع (33.5% مقابل 49.1%؛ قيمة الاحتمال < 0.001). وكان الانتماء للجنس الأنثوي، ووجود أف راد مسنِِّين في الأسرة، ومعايشة وفيات م رتبطة بكوفيد-19 بين الأقارب من العوامل ال رئيسية التي أسهمت في الاستعداد لقبول التطعيم. واعتُُب ر الالتحاق بوظيفة قبل جائحة كوفيد-19 والوصول في المستوى التعليمي إلى جردة البكالوريوس العاملين ال رئيسيين اللذين أسهما في مدى الاستعداد للتطعيم. أثََّ رت الاختلافات في مستوى ال خدل بين المشاركين على مدى استعدادهم للتطعيم. ولذلك، هناك حا جة إلى ت خدلات مستهدفة لزيادة قبول لقاحات كوفيد-19 وفعالية التطعيم بها بين مختلف فئات ال خدل المشمولة بال رداسة.

Le fait d'être de sexe féminin, d'avoir des membres âgés au sein de la famille et d'avoir été témoin de décès liés à cette maladie parmi les proches représentait le principal facteur ayant contribué à la volonté d'accepter la vaccination. Le fait d'avoir un emploi avant la pandémie de COVID-19 et d'avoir un niveau d'éducation équivalent à un diplôme de licence figurait parmi les principaux facteurs ayant favorisé la volonté de se faire vacciner. Les différences de niveau de revenu parmi les participants ont influencé leur volonté de se faire vacciner.

There has been recent debate about the relative importance of the ability to influence the dream and having agency over the pure awareness of dreaming. To underline this, we examined the associations of lucid dreams without agency (LD-Ag) and lucid dreams with agency (LD + Ag) to sleep and mental health problems and long COVID during the pandemic. We collected data in 16 countries on four continents from May to December 2021 on 10,715 subjects. Logistic regression was performed to predict LD-Ag and LD + Ag, with a sample of 8133 participants. We found that 30% of the participants frequently knew they were dreaming during the pandemic. About half of those (17%) reported that they could influence their dreams. Female gender and anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with LD + Ag. Dream recall, nightmares, insomnia, dream enactment behaviour (DEB), sleep vocalisation, short and long COVID and PTSD were positively associated with LD + Ag. Old age, dream recall, nightmares and anxiety symptoms were positively associated with LD-Ag, while short sleep length, being an evening type, and short COVID were negatively associated with LD-Ag. The different associations for LD-Ag and LD + Ag suggest that they may be distinct sleep states. This is also the first study to show that both COVID-19 and long COVID are associated with LD.",

As a result of the pandemic, psychologists and social workers received minimal opportunities for administering in-person care and establishing rapport with patients as they adjusted to virtual or remote workplace settings. This study sought to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical experiences of behavioral health trainees at US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities. This study analyzed psychology and social work responses to the national VA Trainee Satisfaction Survey, including responses before and during the pandemic. Quantitative (bivariate logistic regression) and qualitative content analyses were completed to determine changes in training satisfaction and likelihood a trainee would consider the VA for future employment. Behavioral health trainees who reported being satisfied or very satisfied (vs those reporting being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied) dropped from 94.8% prepandemic to 93.2% during the pandemic (n = 1555) (P = .04; 95% CI, -3.10 to -0.08). Trainee dissatisfaction centered on the onboarding process, an inadequate number of workspaces and computers, and perceptions of insufficient support in the work environment. While satisfaction decreased, the reported likelihood that behavioral health trainees would consider future employment with the VA was not impacted. Understanding the VA trainee experience is important for identifying how to improve behavioral health care professional education and training. This study suggests potential areas of concern that can be addressed during future public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is a growing global public health priority, with the WHO Global Action Plan (GAP) calling for coordinated efforts worldwide. Italy, one of the oldest nations globally, faces a significant challenge with approximately 2 million individuals living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. In response, the Italian Fund for Alzheimer's and other Dementias (IFAD) was established in 2020 to align national efforts with the WHO GAP's objectives. This study analyses IFAD activities from 2021 to 2023, offering insights into Italy's public health response to dementia and its relevance to global strategies. We conducted a structured, iterative review of all activities coordinated by the Italian Dementia Observatory (OssDem-Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS)) within IFAD 2021-2023. Global, regional and national documents on dementia prevention, care and support were retrieved from official websites, institutional repositories and targeted web searches using the keywords 'dementia', 'brain health' and 'ageing'. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data with a predefined matrix mapped to the seven WHO GAP Action Areas. Human-subject studies cited had independent ethics approval and informed consent; no new data were collected for this review. IFAD activities led to substantial progress in dementia care services, with memory clinics, residential care facilities and daycare centres mapped, revealing regional disparities in service provision. Modifiable risk factors accounted for 39.5% of dementia cases in Italy, with an estimated 67 000 cases preventable through risk reduction. National guidelines were developed to standardise dementia care pathways, and training programmes addressed gaps in HP and caregiver preparedness, particularly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy's experience provides valuable lessons for countries facing similar demographic challenges. The IFAD extension to 2024-2026 aims to address persistent regional disparities and further implement national guidelines and prevention strategies. By integrating Italy's progress with broader international frameworks, the Italian model can inform global efforts to enhance dementia care, highlighting the importance of scalable, regionally adapted strategies for addressing the growing global burden of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cancer often struggle with coping with stress and anxiety. Additionally, the COVID-19 crisis has reduced the availability of coping strategies for managing stress. This study aims to determine coping strategies and related factors in patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive study was conducted on 305 patients with cancer admitted to the Cancer Institute of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 2021 to 2022. The researcher used a simple random sampling method. To collect data, a demographic and clinical information questionnaire, along with the Lazarus and Folkman (1985) Ways of Coping Questionnaire, was utilized. Data were analyzed using Spearman's correlation, Mann-Whitney, and ANOVA tests. The mean (SD) age of participants was 53.90 (13.54). Among the participants, 155 (50.82%) were men, 243 (79.67%) had been diagnosed less than 2 years prior, 166 (54.43%) were undergoing chemotherapy, and 81 (26.56%) had colon cancer. Patients predominantly used positive reappraisal (13.51 (2.61)) and escape-avoidance (12.87 (2.51)) coping strategies more than other strategies. A significant relationship was found between the variables of age, sex, number of children, and education level with the coping strategies of the patients (p < 0.05). The findings indicate that patients with cancer frequently used emotion-based strategies to manage their stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears that coping strategies adopted by patients differ somewhat from those before the pandemic. Thus, it is recommended to adjust training according to the demographic factors related to the coping strategies utilized by patients.",

This qualitative study was conducted in 2020 using the conventional content analysis method. Granheim and Landman's approach was used for data analysis. Ten nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 were selected through purposeful sampling. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and analyzed using MAXQDA software. Data analysis revealed ten primary categories, three subcategories, and one theme (burnout as a consequence of unavoidable care provision) extracted from the data analysis. The COVID-19 outbreak and its challenges had a significant impact on nurses' mental health. Nurses were constantly concerned about their patients, their families, and their own well-being. A shortage of staff, equipment, and safe working conditions, along with organizational pressures, led to emotional exhaustion. Nurses also felt isolated due to negative reactions from their families, colleagues, and patients' families. These stressors had a cumulative effect, resulting in burnout that must be addressed by healthcare authorities to ensure the well-being of nurses and improve the quality of care provided.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease affects 850 million people worldwide, with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing a significant burden. People living with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk due to nephrotoxicity of antiretroviral therapy (ART), in part due to widespread use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In response, Uganda recommends routine kidney disease screening at ART initiation. However, the extent of adherence to these guidelines remains poorly understood. We extracted clinical data for adults initiating ART between 2017 and 2024 at three large-volume HIV clinics in Uganda. To determine if kidney disease screening rates had increased appropriately over time, we divided the observation period into three eras as per national guidelines: (1) Test and Treat (2017-2019), that recommended screening only PWH and diabetes or hypertension; (2) DTG rollout/COVID-19 (2020-2022); and (3) creatinine-for-all (2023-2024), recommending screening everyone initiating ART. Logistic regression models were fit to identify correlates of renal screening. Of the 17,485 participants, only 22.4% (3,909/17,485) were screened for kidney disease. Screening was more common at the urban site (54.2%) compared to rural sites (10.0%). At rural sites, screening declined over time and individuals were 83% less likely to be screened in the creatinine-for-all era compared to the baseline era (aOR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.13-0.22) while it increased at urban site (aOR 9.27, 95% CI: 7.37-11.66). Male sex (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20- 1.57), older age (>45 years), hypertension, and non-TDF-based ART regimens were associated with higher screening odds at rural sites. Diabetes, opportunistic infections, and TDF use were not significantly associated with screening likelihood at any site.

    "abstract": "The effect of metformin on preventing long-term COVID-19 symptoms among low-risk adults has not been studied. The objective of this study was to Assess metformin compared with placebo during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on the presence of COVID-19 symptoms 180 days later. The ACTIV-6 platform evaluated repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between September 19, 2023 and May 1, 2024, 2983 outpatient adults ≥30 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and ≥2 COVID-19 symptoms for ≤7 days were included from 90 sites. Participants were randomized to metformin (titrated to 1500 mg daily) or placebo for 14 days. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or death (PASCD) was ascertained by asking whether participants had symptoms they attributed to COVID-19 on day 180. Secondary outcomes included clinician diagnosis of long COVID. For the primary outcome, the single-sided threshold for efficacy was 0.975. Among 2983 participants, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR] 38-57); 63% were female; 47% Hispanic/Latino; 83% reported ≥1 prior COVID-19 infections or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. There were no deaths. Overall, 96 (3.2%) reported COVID-19 symptoms on day 90, 101 (3.4%) on day 120, and 79 (2.6%) on day 180. The covariate-adjusted risk of PASCD on day 180 was lower in the metformin group (-0.008; 95% credible interval [CrI] -0.022 to 0.006; posterior probability of efficacy [PPE] 0.83), compared with the placebo group with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.79 (95% CrI 0.474 to 1.230). The risk of clinician diagnosis of long COVID (secondary outcome) on day 180 was lower in the metformin group (-0.007; 95% CrI -0.015 to 0.001; PPE 0.96), with a relative risk of 0.495 (95% CrI 0.155 to 0.995). The posterior probability of efficacy for metformin preventing the primary endpoint did not exceed the prespecified threshold of 0.975 for declaring efficacy. Secondary outcomes were numerically better with metformin. ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04885530 ).",

    "title": "School masking and COVID-19 community transmission: a synthetic control study.",
    "abstract": "K-12 schools play a crucial role not only as educational settings but also as hubs for social interaction among children, making them potential drivers of disease transmission within families and the broader community. Little is known about the impact of mandatory school masking policies on community SARS-CoV-2 infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study addressed this gap by evaluating the association between mandatory school masking policies and community infection rates, accounting for temporal and regional variations. We conducted a retrospective quasi-experimental study using the synthetic control method. The study focused on the fall 2021 school reopening period in the United States, a time when most U.S. schools returned to fully in-person learning but accompanied by substantial variation in masking policies. Analyses controlled community characteristics prior to reopening and baseline infection rates. Counties with mandatory school masking policies experienced lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates compared to counties with non-mandatory policies. During the first nine weeks after school reopening, there was a reduction of 1,096 cases per 100,000 people (95% confidence interval: 880 to 1,310 fewer cases per 100,000 people). This association was influenced by baseline infection rates, population density, and mobility patterns. Mandatory school masking policies were associated with notable reductions in community SARS-CoV-2 infection rates during the fall 2021 school reopening period. This study highlights the potential role of school masking as a public health intervention in mitigating community transmission.

    "abstract": "Over seven million U.S. adults experience \"long COVID\", or persistent health issues after COVID-19. Multiple guidelines recommend the inclusion of functional status in long COVID diagnostic criteria, but more evidence is needed to guide this recommendation. This study explores the adjusted odds of developing long COVID by pre-infection symptoms and functional status, and the feasibility of estimating functional status using health records data. Retrospective cohort study in a multicenter national longitudinal cohort of U.S. adults with history of COVID-19, using health records and survey responses through July 2022 (All of Us CDR 7.0). Pre-infection (-5 years) incidences of (a) at least one symptom common in long COVID, and (b) functional status, indicated by All of Us baseline survey responses and diagnostic/procedure/billing codes. Disease and demographic data covariates were included in the adjusted models. N = 65,464 met inclusion criteria (n=40,655 had post-infection occurrences of at least one symptom (long COVID group), while n=24,809 had none). Adjusted odds ratios within 99% confidence intervals [99% CI] of developing long COVID increased with lower pre-infection self-reported mental health (\"Good\" compared to \"Excellent\" AOR=1.14 [1.04,1.25], P>0.000), and more pre-infection symptoms (compared to the median of four, people with zero had much lower odds (AOR=0.15 [0.04,0.61], P=0.008). Adjusted odds were not significantly affected by any single pre-infection symptom, self-rated physical ability, or clinical documentation of functional impairment. Greater pre-illness symptom burden and lower self-rated mental health increased the odds of long COVID symptoms, after adjusting for demographics, variant, functional status, and individual symptoms. Long COVID represents a change from baseline functioning and health, even in people with pre-infection incident symptoms and functional impairments. This estimation of pre-infection functional status using harmonized electronic health records data demonstrated the feasibility of these data in developing the diagnostic utility of functional status changes in long COVID.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates vaccine hesitancy among the 50+ population in Europe and Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the role of national contexts alongside individual determinants. Utilizing data from the SHARE Corona Surveys (SCS1 and SCS2), the analysis includes over 48,000 respondents across 28 countries. The framework is guided by the WHO's Complacency, Convenience, and Confidence (3Cs) model to explore factors influencing vaccination intent. Complacency examines perceived risks and visibility of the virus's consequences, convenience evaluates accessibility and affordability of vaccines, and confidence assesses trust in vaccines, healthcare systems, and policymakers. Key findings suggest that higher COVID-19 mortality rates and stricter containment measures reduce complacency and increase vaccine uptake. Greater healthcare expenditure and Human Development Index (HDI) scores enhance convenience, leading to higher vaccination rates. Additionally, trust in governments and health authorities as well as in the vaccine itself predict confidence, shaping vaccination intent. The study reveals significant national disparities in vaccination attitudes and behaviours, linked to socio-economic factors and healthcare quality. By incorporating multivariate logistic regression models, the research highlights the interplay between individual and national factors, suggesting that successful vaccination campaigns require a holistic approach addressing both personal hesitations and systemic barriers. This research hence underscores the importance of public trust, robust healthcare systems, and targeted communication strategies to mitigate vaccine hesitancy and improve pandemic response outcomes.",

However, the time to design, produce, and screen high-performance RNA sensors remains a critical challenge. The fundamental rules governing RNA-RNA interactions-specifically the structure-function relationships that determine sensor performance-remain poorly understood. Here, we present a method enabling versatile in-silico RNA-targeting analysis (VISTA), a machine learning-guided framework for the rapid design of RNA sensors. VISTA integrates biophysical modeling of both sensor and target RNAs with a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) machine learning framework. Using high-throughput experimental measurements with sequence-structure feature extraction to train predictive models, we capture the key determinants of RNA sensor performance. We find that by using toehold switches as a model RNA sensor, Toehold-VISTA successfully designs RNA sensors with improved function against SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These findings establish a broadly applicable, target-aware design strategy for accelerating RNA sensor engineering across biotechnology and diagnostic applications.",

Conversely, field-deployable methods are limited to low levels of multiplexing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed Streamlined Highlighting of Infections to Navigate Epidemics (SHINE), a sensitive and deployable CRISPR-based technology for nucleic acid detection. Here, we introduce microfluidic SHINE (mSHINE) which enables >100-plex nucleic acid detection using a highly portable microfluidic manifold. The manifold directs a diluted sample into individual reaction chambers, each of which contains lyophilized SHINE reagents and a microscopic stir bar or bead for mixing. Samples can be loaded using a syringe by hand, greatly simplifying the testing process. A subsequent sealing step allows for >100 SHINE reactions to proceed independently and in parallel. We demonstrate that mSHINE has equal sensitivity to SHINE, allowing for highly multiplexed pathogen detection in ≤ 1 hour. In addition, mSHINE can detect single-nucleotide variants, including mutations associated with drug susceptibility. mSHINE shifts the paradigm of laboratory-based multiplexed nucleic acid testing, greatly benefiting patients and public health.",

In this study, we assessed a low-dose inactivated split virus vaccine derived from clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1, formulated with an Alum/CpG adjuvant, using a preclinical mouse model. This vaccine induced potent humoral and cellular immune responses, generating high titers of cross-reactive antibodies targeting both hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins across homologous and heterologous H5 clades. The Alum/CpG adjuvant enabled significant antigen dose-sparing while promoting a balanced Th1/Th2 immune profile. Functional analyses demonstrated strong virus neutralization, neuraminidase inhibition, and potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity. Additionally, the vaccine elicited robust antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and effectively controlled viral replication in the lungs, accompanied by reduced lung inflammation. Importantly, vaccinated mice were fully protected against lethal challenges with both the homologous clade 2.3.4.4b and heterologous clade 1 H5N1 viruses, despite low hemagglutination inhibition titers. Electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping revealed serum antibodies targeting multiple epitopes on homologous HA and NA, with some cross-reacting to conserved epitopes on heterologous proteins, underscoring broad immune recognition. Collectively, these results highlight the potential of this vaccine candidate to provide broad, multifunctional, and durable immunity against both current and emerging H5N1 threats, supporting its further development for pandemic preparedness.",

In this mixed-methods study, we interviewed 42 pregnant and postpartum Latine mothers from low-income households living in the New York Metropolitan area to better understand pandemic related challenges and potential sources of support unique to this group of women. First, we identified broad themes related to specific psychosocial stressors impacting Latine mothers and their families. Second, in an effort to investigate coping strategies that may buffer feelings of persistent stress, mothers were divided into sustained-stress and tapered-stress groups based on reported levels of perceived stress during the height of the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared to the time of interview (August-December 2020). These two groups of mothers were significantly different on levels of PTSD symptoms, social support, and perceived discrimination. Notably, mothers in the tapered-stress group who reported lower-levels of stress at the time of interview described experiences of being distracted by daily activities or by family members as a coping mechanism. Together, these findings highlight the need to address structural barriers and improve access to mental health support in order to mitigate continuing sources of pandemic related stressors for Latine families.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global influenza transmission. We aimed to elucidate how meteorological and air pollution drivers influenced seasonal influenza A subtypes and B lineage in Southern China pre-, during-, and postpandemic. Methods: We analyzed weekly influenza surveillance data from Southern China (2011-2024) and corresponding meteorological data. Using an interpretable machine learning framework combining XG-Boost and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), we quantified the dynamic contributions of environmental factors to influenza subtype positivity rates. GAM models were employed to identify climate thresholds for influenza transmission. Findings: The pandemic reshaped influenza transmission and environmental dependencies in Southern China. Post-pandemic circulation showed marked subtype‑specific shifts: A/H3N2 winter positivity nearly tripled (12.670% vs. 4.861% pre-pandemic, p  < 0.001), A/H1N1 increased over four‑fold (4.325% vs. 0.935% pre-pandemic, p = 0.064), while B/Victoria circulation declined significantly (0.594% vs. 1.623% pre-pandemic, p  < 0.001). Environmental driver hierarchies underwent notable temporal reorganization. For A/H3N2, PM10 influence surged from 9.18% to 30.37% during the pandemic before dropping to 3.95% post-pandemic, while visibility emerged as the dominant driver (58.05% vs. 37.26% pre-pandemic). A/H1N1 showed peak humidity sensitivity during the pandemic (18.59%) that later diminished (3.78%), with transmission promotion occurring only below a threshold of ≤11.44 g/m³ absolute humidity. B/Victoria maintained consistent sea‑level pressure sensitivity, peaking post-pandemic (36.36%), with transmission optima at 8.58 g/m³. Seasonal modeling revealed subtype and phase‑specific environmental thresholds that shifted between \"promotion\" and \"inhibition\" zones for humidity and visibility, indicating key alterations in climate‑influenza relationships across the pandemic transition. Interpretation: These findings show that pandemic‑era disruptions recalibrated the environmental architecture of influenza transmission. New environmental thresholds and driver hierarchies reveal shifts in viral‑climate relationships. The identification of distinct \"promotion‑inhibition\" zones for each subtype establishes a new paradigm for climate‑pathogen interactions. These insights require immediate integration into surveillance frameworks and predictive models.",

    "abstract": "The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a major public health crisis due to its rapid transmission and significant morbidity and mortality rates. In response, there is an urgent need to discover novel antiviral agents targeting key viral proteins. In this study, a new series of pyrimidine-2,4-dione derivatives was synthesized from barbituric acid and its thio analog, aiming to explore their potential inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The synthesis involved 1,4-addition and cyclodehydration reactions, yielding novel pyran and condensed pyrimidine derivatives. The chemical structures were confirmed using various spectroscopic techniques. Molecular docking studies were performed using MOE software (version 2022) targeting Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7), revealing favorable binding affinities for several compounds. Compound 9 showed the best docking score (-12.70 kcal/mol), followed by Compound 4 (-12.38 kcal/mol) and Compound 11 (-12.13 kcal/mol), with key interactions involving residues such as Asn142, His41, and Glu166. DFT calculations were carried out to evaluate electronic properties, including energy gap (ΔE), global hardness (η), and softness (σ), indicating that Compound 10 was the most reactive with notable HOMO-LUMO characteristics. Additionally, the synthesized compounds were screened for drug-likeness based on Lipinski's rule of five and ADME parameters. Overall, the study identifies promising pyrimidine-based inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and provides valuable insights for further optimization and development of potential antiviral agents.",

Adult patients with a specialist's diagnosis of RCC or UCC and who provided informed consent were included. Active smokers were excluded. Of 22,140 consecutive out-patients screened, 421 were eligible for general analysis, and 226 met the RCC/UCC criteria per DGP guidelines for prevalence analysis. Among the 421 patients, 71.3% were female, 77.9% had therapy-resistant chronic cough (TRCC), and 22.1% had UCC. The main causes of TRCC were otherwise controlled asthma (59.1%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (19.1%). Diagnosis had been established on average 6.4 ± 7.6 years prior.

This study, the first in a secondary care setting in Germany to determine RCC/UCC prevalence in outpatients, found a higher prevalence in women and a long history of suffering. These findings underscore the need for improved diagnostic procedures and new therapeutic developments for RCC/UCC. Key limitations include the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on data collection, a relatively small UCC sample, and potential referral bias due to the secondary care setting.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines have long been one of the most effective strategies for public health during epidemics and pandemics caused by infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy is a public health problem that hinders the control of disease transmission. It refers to the refusal or reluctance to receive vaccines for various reasons, including sex, personal beliefs, cultural factors, and a lack of confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. The COVID-19 pandemic was controlled using vaccines, but maintaining ideal vaccination coverage is essential to continue reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. In Brazil, vaccination coverage did not reach the targeted goal, raising concerns about the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Brazil. A systematic review with meta-analysis was carried out using the PubMed, Medline, LILACS, and ScienceDirect databases. In the search, 238 articles were reviewed, of which 8 were found to be eligible for analysis. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 13.3%, or 0.133 (95% CI = 0.082–0.208), in Brazil. In the subgroup analysis by pandemic wave, the first pandemic wave showed a prevalence of 13.6% or 0.136 (95% CI = 0.081–0.220), while the second pandemic wave had a prevalence of 11.4% or 0.114 (95% CI = 0.029–0.358). Due to heterogeneity, meta-regression showed a significant association between vaccine hesitancy and parents of children and adolescents (Q = 95.55; df = 2; p = <0.0001), indicating that vaccine hesitancy is significantly higher in this population compared to the general population and older adults. Fake news, lack of knowledge, personal beliefs, income, being a woman, being a young male individual without comorbidities, being married with older children, being older, and being asymptomatic were the main factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. In the first meta-analysis conducted in Brazil, vaccine hesitancy was more prevalent among parents of children and adolescents, and vaccine hesitancy decreased in the second pandemic wave. Public policies must be developed to address the factors that interfere with acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine.",

Although symptom profiles may overlap, comparative epidemiological data from the general population are limited. We conducted a representative online survey of 4,632 adults in Germany and investigated mental symptoms associated with PCS and PCVS, including fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disturbances, impaired performance and depressed mood. Socio-demographic factors, vaccination status, vaccine type and number of vaccinations were analysed. The prevalence of self-reported mental symptoms of PCS was 12.1% among respondents, with women and younger individuals more commonly affected. The prevalence of self-reported PCVS was 12.6% among vaccinated individuals, with no significant gender differences, but fewer cognitive symptoms in older adults. Respondents with only one vaccination reported the highest rate of PCVS symptoms (20.8%), which decreased to 8.9% for those with four or more vaccinations. Differences between vaccine types were small overall, but non-mRNA vaccines were associated with a slightly higher rate of sleep and concentration problems. Mental symptoms are relatively common after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and show overlap, especially fatigue. These findings highlight how difficult it is to distinguish PCS from PCVS and emphasize the need to consider alternative explanations, such as undiagnosed depressive disorders, in clinical assessments.",

Classification methods used to assess COVID-19 risk often treat testing as a secondary, qualitative factor, overlooking its value as a quantitative input. Integrating testing data with case counts can improve the accuracy of regional infection probability estimates. Spatial analysis revealed that probabilistic metrics-such as the local probability of infection-showed stronger spatial synchronization of epidemic patterns compared to observed-to-expected case ratios. The death-to-population ratio displayed the strongest positive correlation with the observed-to-expected cases ratio. Conversely, the case fatality rate exhibited only a weak positive correlation with probabilistic metrics, though these correlations were not consistently statistically significant. The findings underscore the potential of probabilistic metrics, such as the local probability of infection, in predicting COVID-19 risk. Further research is warranted to explore the predictive capacity of probabilistic metrics concerning death-related outcomes.",

A retrospective electronic search of medical discharge records was conducted for adult patients admitted to the neurology ward over a two-year period, and patients with neuroinfectious diseases were identified. Diagnostic criteria were applied to classify patients according to the certainty of their neuroinfectious disease diagnosis. Neuroinfectious diseases accounted for 15 % of the 802 admissions to the neurology ward.

The educational intervention strategies focused on applying interprofessional learning among undergraduate healthcare students by integrating education technologies (i.e., virtual reality 360 and gamification) into two e-learning modules. Three time-points involving pre and post modules' evaluation (before and after the 1st learning module, and after the 2nd learning module) were collected using validated scales including Interprofessional Attitudes Scale and Online Student Engagement Scale. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association between interventions and changes in outcomes from pre-to post-intervention by adjusting the covariates. To further validate the quantitative findings, focus-group interviews were conducted with a verbatim transcript obtained from participating students for content analysis. A total of 75 undergraduate healthcare students from Hong Kong, Mainland China, South Korea, and Thailand participated in the study. A statistically significant positive change was detected in interprofessional attitude (F = 5.90, p = 0.004), interprofessional diversity and ethics (F = 4.43, p = 0.014) and student engagement (F = 13.42, p < 0.001) after the e-learning modules. A statistically significant correlation was also detected between student engagement and interprofessional attitude. From the qualitative content analysis, three core categories were identified. They were 'Cultural diversity recognition', 'Acquisition of interprofessional attitudes and skills' and 'Active learning engagement'. The technology-enhanced e-learning modules significantly enhanced undergraduate healthcare students' interprofessional attitude and student learning engagement in terms of interprofessional education. Healthcare educators in higher education are encouraged to integrate educational technology as a pedagogical approach to stimulate interprofessional learning of undergraduate healthcare students.",

    "abstract": "Emerging research documents concerning mental health outcomes among essential workers at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mental health outcomes may have varied across states in the United States, as state-level policies differed. Questions also remain about the mental health of workers during the second year of the pandemic. Using nationally representative data from the U.S. Household Pulse Survey (April-July 2021), we documented the mental health of essential workers and tested whether state-level policies (e.g., mask mandates) reduced mental health disparities for essential workers. Results show that food and beverage essential workers experienced heightened anxiety and depression relative to nonessential workers. Moreover, for food and beverage workers, disparities in mental health were smaller in states with mask mandates, expanded paid leave, and higher minimum wage compared to states without these policies. The present study points to the potential for state-level policies to protect the mental health of essential workers.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a dramatic loss of human lives worldwide and caused economic and social disruptions. The risk of another pandemic occurring is ever-present requiring countries to document factors that influenced the response to COVID-19 to guide the response to future pandemics. This study documents lessons learnt from Mozambique's COVID-19 response, considering the perspectives of various stakeholders and examining different components of the response. We used a qualitative phenomenology research design and collected data using in-depth interviews. We used purposive sampling by selecting institutions with relevant experience and knowledge to inform the study objectives. We also used snowballing techniques by asking respondents for other potential informants. We interviewed 19 individuals indicated by the representatives of the institutions selected for the study. The institutions were mostly based in Maputo city, the country's capital. Participants were asked about their role in the organization; responsibility in vaccine distribution and delivery in Mozambique; their opinion on what worked well in the country's response to COVID-19, and what could be improved as preparation to future pandemics. Data was coded using a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software Maxqda 2020 and analyzed using a deductive thematic approach. A validation meeting was held, in which research participants were asked to check the accuracy of the results and interpretations. Key drivers of the COVID-19 response were strong leadership; a clear plan and strategies; a functional coordination mechanism; the use of evidence to make decisions; a careful consideration of priority groups; investments in the supply chain and surveillance systems; the utilization of pre-existing vaccination structures; and partnership between the government and several stakeholders. There is room for improvement including the development of a clear budget, a communication plan, creation of an emergency fund, accountability in the use of funds, decentralization of surveillance infrastructure and representation of vulnerable, marginalized, and hard-to-reach populations in the design and implementation of pandemic response. The lessons learned from the COVID-19 response in Mozambique, which could be considered when preparing for an effective and equitable response to future pandemics, are in essence the following: there should be government leadership, a response plan, adequate resources, use of data to inform decisions, constant vigilance, a prompt response, involvement of all stakeholders and documentation of actions for continuous learning. These lessons could improve pandemic preparedness nationally and globally.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains a global health challenge despite the availability of vaccines and antiviral treatments. The emergence of immune escape variants and the persistence of long COVID symptoms continue to complicate prevention and therapy, especially in low-resource settings. Functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) have shown promise as broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We evaluated the antiviral efficacy of amitriptyline, a widely used antidepressant and known FIASMA, against SARS-CoV-2. In vitro neutralization assays using pseudotyped virus-like particles (VLPs) and clinical isolates were performed to assess its ability to inhibit viral entry and replication. Amitriptyline significantly inhibited infection by SARS-CoV-2 VLPs bearing spike proteins, including those with mutations in the receptor-binding domain. Moreover, it reduced replication of clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates D614G, Omicron BA.5, and Omicron XBB.1 in a dose-dependent manner at subtoxic concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that amitriptyline neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 across multiple variants. These results support the potential of amitriptyline as a repurposed antiviral drug. Further clinical studies are warranted to evaluate its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 in humans.",

    "abstract": "Background: Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) are a persistent public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among school-aged children. Objective: This study aimed to compare IPI prevalence and risk factors before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini, based on the hypothesis that pandemic-related disruptions may have influenced infection dynamics, despite no formal interventions being introduced. Methods: A prospective cohort of 128 schoolchildren from Manzini and Lubombo Provinces was followed from 2019 to 2022. Stool samples were analyzed using the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde (MIF) method. Structured interviews assessed hygiene behaviors and household factors. Logistic regression was used to identify associations with infection risk, reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Overall, IPI prevalence remained consistent (43.0% in 2019 vs. 42.2% in 2022), with protozoan infections predominating and helminth infections remaining low (1.6% in 2019 and 2.4% in 2022, respectively). In 2022, children with only one employed parent had significantly higher odds of IPIs (aOR = 3.97; 95% CI: 1.48-10.64; p=0.006) and pathogenic protozoan infections (aOR = 4.33; 95% CI: 1.41-13.27; p=0.01). Handwashing before meals was protective in 2019 (aOR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02-0.58; p=0.01) but not significant in 2022. Notably, Giardia intestinalis infections declined, while Blastocystis hominis increased. Conclusion: The stable infection rates and changing species composition suggest that pandemic-associated shifts in behavior and public health disruptions may have influenced IPIs' epidemiology. Continued surveillance and targeted hygiene interventions are needed to mitigate the burden of IPIs in schoolchildren.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, three COVID-19 vaccines were among the first widely used (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, and BNT162b2), which aimed to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Although effective against severe disease, they showed waning NAb levels and reduced efficacy against variants, prompting booster doses. Thus, it is important to investigate and compare the response induced by these vaccines and boosters. In this study, we compare the magnitude, durability, and cross-reactivity of NAbs among vaccinated volunteers in Brazil using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay that measures Abs capable of blocking the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The BNT162b2 two-dose regimen resulted in the highest and most durable NAb levels, followed by ChAdOx1, while those induced by CoronaVac significantly declined over time. Breakthrough infections boosted NAb levels, especially for CoronaVac and ChAdOx1. All vaccines showed reduced neutralizing capacity against Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. Booster doses, particularly the first one, significantly increased and maintained NAb levels, including those against Omicron. Our findings provide valuable population-based comparison of NAb levels elicited by different vaccines following primary inoculation and booster doses. Notably, the mRNA vaccine exhibited a strong primary and initial booster NAb response against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "In the era of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the application of zinc has increased worldwide. It has the potential to increase the body's antioxidant status and provide better immune makeup. Currently, zinc is indiscriminately used as a therapeutic agent, and this creates an unwanted antagonism with the other interacting micronutrients that are present in the gut and causes secondary deficiencies of other critical micronutrients, which often leads to various complications. In this study, our aim was to synthesize a nano-sized zinc followed by its dietary fortification. We found that the supplemental nano-zinc has an antiviral effect using milkfish (Chanos chanos) as a model organism. The IRF3 gene was chosen as a molecular marker for antiviral assessment, which has different integral zinc binding sites. For the first time, we have characterized the IRF3 gene in C. chanos and discovered certain important domains as zinc binding sites, as well as other important domains related to antiviral activity, such as the serine protease NS3 activity and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) tryptophan pentad repeat domain. The expression profile of IRF3 was significantly improved among fish supplemented with dietary nano-zinc, and the best effect was observed in the group provided feed fortified with 40 ppm nano-zinc. The results of this study revealed that nano-zinc can directly be incorporated into IRF3, which increases its bioavailability and improves its antiviral activity through biochemical pathways, as described in the STRING and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of viral samples from prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as from prolonged infections with other respiratory viruses have indicated that there are several consistent patterns of evolution observed across these infections. These patterns include accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitution, viral genetic diversification into distinct lineages, parallel substitutions across infected individuals, and heterogeneity in rates of antigenic evolution. Here, we use within-host model simulations to explore the drivers of these intrahost evolutionary patterns. Our simulations build on a tunably rugged fitness landscape model to first assess the role that mutations that impact only viral replicative fitness have in driving these patterns. We then further incorporate pleiotropic sites that jointly impact replicative fitness and antigenicity to assess the role that immune pressure has on these patterns. Through simulation, we find that the empirically observed patterns of viral evolution in prolonged infections cannot be robustly explained by viral populations evolving on replicative fitness landscapes alone. Instead, we find that immune pressure is needed to consistently reproduce the observed patterns. Moreover, our simulations show that the amount of antigenic change that occurs is higher when immune pressure is stronger and at intermediate immune breadth. While our simulation models were designed to shed light on drivers of viral evolution in prolonged infections with respiratory viruses that generally cause acute infection, their structure can be used to better understand viral evolution in other acutely infecting viruses such as noroviruses that can cause prolonged infection as well as viruses such as HIV that are known to chronically infect.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19-associated sepsis poses unique challenges in intensive care units (ICUs), where patients are often immunocompromised and prone to secondary bacterial infections. Differentiating immune phenotypes between pure viral and viral-bacterial sepsis is essential for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. To compare clinical characteristics, immune profiles, and outcomes between patients with pure COVID-19 sepsis and those complicated by confirmed secondary bacterial infection, and to identify immune markers capable of differentiating sepsis phenotypes. This retrospective cohort study enrolled ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia between July 2021 and December 2023. Patients were classified into viral sepsis (V group, n=53) and viral-bacterial sepsis (VB group, n=28) based on microbiological confirmation of secondary infection. Clinical data, inflammatory markers, cytokine levels, and neutrophil CD64 expression (via flow cytometry) were analyzed. Logistic regression, ROC curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate phenotypes, identify discriminative markers, and assess outcomes. The VB group exhibited significantly higher SOFA scores (median 9.5 vs 7, P<0.001), serum creatinine (103.2 vs 80.85 µmol/L, P=0.001), and LDH levels (531 vs 392 U/L, P=0.009), indicating more severe organ dysfunction. ICU stay was longer in the VB group (median 16 vs 13 days, P=0.027), and ICU mortality was slightly higher (85.7% vs 83.0%, P=0.785). Immune profiling showed significantly higher IL-2 (36.8 vs 22.1 pg/mL, P<0.001), IL-10, IFN-γ, and MYD88 in the V group, whereas TNF-α (62.3 vs 43.7 pg/mL, P=0.002) and PCT (2.51 vs 1.12 ng/mL, P=0.001) were higher in the VB group. IL-2, MYD88, and PCT independently discriminated phenotypes. Neutrophil CD64 showed strong predictive value for superinfection (AUC=0.969).

    "abstract": "Under-5 mortality and malnutrition are major public health challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), worsened by crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence on social protection reducing under-5 mortality in LMICs is limited. We examined the impact of social protection coverage, defined as the proportion of the population covered by any form of social protection, on under-5 mortality, stunting, and wasting across 46 LMICs from 2000 to 2021. Our study analyzed 1012 country-year observations. Outcomes included under-5 mortality (deaths per 1000 live births), prevalence of wasting (weight-for-height Z-scores < -2 SD), and stunting (height-for-age Z-scores < -2 SD). Coverage of social protection was defined as the proportion of the population receiving at least one social protection benefit. We used fixed-effects Poisson models with robust standard errors to estimate associations, adjusting for socioeconomic, healthcare, and gender-related variables. Interaction terms captured social protection mitigation effects during COVID-19, and counterfactual scenarios estimated averted deaths. Analyses were disaggregated by sex and age groups. Social protection coverage prevented an estimated 3.05 million under-5 deaths overall, including 583,590 during the pandemic. Higher coverage was significantly associated with reductions in under-5 mortality (IRR:0.71,95%CI:0.54-0.96), stunting (IRR:0.75,95%CI:0.60-0.94), and wasting (IRR:0.87,95%CI:0.78-0.98). During the COVID-19 pandemic years, social protection led to additional reductions in under-5 mortality (IRR:0.68,95%CI:0.59-0.79) and stunting (IRR:0.74,95%CI:0.57-0.95). Toddler mortality (1-2 years) showed the greatest reduction effects (IRR:0.62,95%CI:0.41-0.95). Females showed slightly stronger effects. Sensitivity and triangulation analyses validated all results. Social protection coverage strongly reduced child mortality, stunting, and wasting in LMICs, with heightened impact during the pandemic years. Scaling up social protection programs can be crucial for reducing health inequities, building child resilience, and advancing child health targets in the future.

    "abstract": "Organizational characteristics, including structures, culture, and climate, are important determinants of intervention scale-up success. Little is known about which characteristics are most important for HIV intervention scale-up success in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and how they influence implementation in these contexts. We sought to examine the relationship between organizational characteristics and scale-up success within an implementation trial testing strategies to scale up Systems Navigation and Psychosocial Counselling (SNaP) for people who inject drugs (PWID) with HIV in Vietnam. This study was conducted in 42 HIV testing clinics in Vietnam. Informed by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment Framework, we assessed the association between five organizational characteristics and SNaP scale-up success: (1) implementation leadership; (2) staff workload; (3) percent PWID; (4) implementation climate; and (5) organizational readiness. We conducted a mixed methods study including surveys at baseline and endline with clinic staff and PWID participants in all clinics and interviews with clinic staff (n = 48) in six high and six low-performing clinics. To develop a context-driven scale-up success index for our outcome measure, we undertook a modified Delphi process with 14 experts in HIV, PWID, and implementation science. We assessed the relationship between our organizational characteristics and scale-up success using thematic and multiple linear regression analyses and explored the convergence of results. Greater implementation leadership (ß = 12.20, p = 0.004), high staff workload (ß = 4.71, p = 0.008), and lower implementation climate scores (ß = -6.23, p = 0.046) were significantly associated with scale-up success. Qualitatively, participants described the importance of implementation leadership, particularly during COVID-19, and, to a lesser extent, implementation climate and organizational readiness for scale-up success. Some also described how more time spent on SNaP delivery improved fidelity but exacerbated workload. These findings demonstrate that prioritizing implementation leadership-focused strategies for the scale-up of HIV interventions like SNaP could improve implementation outcomes.",

This is the first report on one-year outcomes in participants with chronic migraine (CM) and in the EM population with prior preventive treatment failures. Here, we report the long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy and functional outcomes of one-year preventive treatment of EM or CM with atogepant.MethodsThis is an interim analysis of an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, 156-week, safety extension study that enrolled completers from phase 3 PROGRESS and ELEVATE trials. The participants completing week 52 or early termination were evaluated. Eligible adults with at least a one-year history of migraine, with either CM (PROGRESS) or EM who previously had inadequate response to two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments (ELEVATE). All participants received atogepant 60 mg once daily. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of atogepant. Efficacy and functional outcomes were prespecified exploratory analyses.ResultsOf 596 participants, 595 (PROGRESS, n = 325; ELEVATE, n = 270) were treated and included in the safety population and 524 (PROGRESS, n = 284; ELEVATE, n = 240) were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. In this interim analysis, mean duration of atogepant exposure was 496.5 days. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 79.0% of participants; most were mild/moderate and not related to atogepant.

The patterns of COVID-19 incidence in the country may have varied over time during the pandemic, with geographic factors playing different roles in the early, middle, and later phases of transmission. We utilized spatial statistics and GeoDetector methods to analyze district-level variations in COVID-19 incidence across Nepal from January 2020 to December 2022 using laboratory confirmed cases of the disease and a range of physical, biological and socioenvironmental explanatory variables. The analysis focused on identifying spatial patterns, hotspots, and key driving factors contributing to the uneven distribution of COVID-19 cases. We found an uneven distribution of COVID-19 in Nepal, with persistent hotspots in major cities, such as Kathmandu and Pokhara, reaching up to 133 cases per 1000 population. GeoDetector analysis identified the key drivers, including road density (q = 0.59, p < 0.001), ICU bed distribution (q = 0.51, p < 0.001), and population density (q = 0.46, p < 0.001). While natural environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and NDVI had low and statistically insignificant independent explanatory power, their interaction with variables such as nighttime light, NDVI, and population density enhanced explanatory strength, highlighting the complex spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence.

Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "While sirolimus is widely used in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its impact on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination remains unclear. To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine on the children with TSC on sirolimus, we conducted a prospective cohort study (July 1st, 2021-April 1st, 2022) in 117 children: 43 patients with sirolimus, 18 patients without sirolimus, and 56 healthy controls. Neutralizing antibody titers were measured pre-vaccination and at one and three months after the two-dose vaccination and adverse events were monitored throughout follow-up. Infection incidence was assessed via questionnaire. The primary endpoint was seroconversion rate, with secondary endpoints including neutralizing antibody titers, adverse events, and breakthrough infection incidence following China's December 2022 COVID-19 surge. Results showed lower 1-month seroconversion (75.0% [12/16] vs 98.2% [55/56], p = .001) and reduced antibody titers (median 102.1 vs 213.1 IU/mL, p = .04) in non-sirolimus group versus controls, with declining trend in 3-month responses [44.4% (8/18) vs 54.5% (30/55), median 102.1 vs 213.1 IU/mL, p > .05]. Sirolimus group demonstrated stronger humoral responses versus non-sirolimus counterparts: higher antibody titers at 1 month (median: 168.9 IU/mL vs 102.1 IU/mL, p = .029) and 3 months (median: 38.1 IU/ml vs 15.8 IU/mL, p = .011), with higher seroconversion trend [1 month: 87.5% (35/40) vs 75% (12/16) (p = .259); 3 months: 67.6% (25/37) vs 44.4% (8/18)] (p = .1). The vaccine elicited attenuated immunogenicity in non-sirolimus group whereas vaccine combined with sirolimus might provide better protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination conferred good safety with mild breakthrough infections.",

    "abstract": "People reporting long COVID (LC) or post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) not only suffer from their symptoms but also from stigmatization. Despite ample account and characterization of stigma experiences so far, its mechanisms and consequences on health outcomes, and particularly the role of \"psychologization\" remain unclear. In a cross-sectional observational study, we examined a large convenience sample of adults who report having LC or PCVS. We translated and adapted the \"Long Covid Stigma Scale\" to measure stigmatization. We measured generally perceived and personally experienced psychologization with newly developed scales/items. Outcome measures included disclosure concerns, loss of trust in medicine, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and loneliness. We calculated overall prevalences of stigma and psychologization and their correlations with the outcomes. Using mediation analysis with SEM, we tested the hypothesis that psychologization of LC and PCVS syndromes causes harm by increasing stigmatization. Altogether, N = 2053 individuals (68% reporting LC, 32% reporting PCVS) were included in the analyses. The overall prevalences of stigma experiences were high: 83% of those reporting LC and 90% of those reporting PCVS experienced stigma. Prevalences of perceived psychologization (LC: 87%, PCVS: 91%) and experienced psychologization (LC: 82%, PCVS: 87%) were similarly high. Both stigmatization and psychologization were positively correlated with disclosure concerns, loss of trust in medicine, depression, anxiety, and loneliness as well as negatively correlated with life satisfaction and self-esteem. Mediation analysis indicated that stigmatization mediated a relevant proportion of the relationship between psychologization and negative outcomes. People reporting LC or PCVS are subject to stigmatization and psychologization. From a patient perspective, psychologization appears to be an important driver of stigmatization and negative outcomes.",

We conducted a survey of local health departments in New York State regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We further conducted in-depth interviews with a number of local health departments to identify specific use cases of wastewater surveillance data. Almost all survey respondents used wastewater surveillance data and reported advantages to wastewater surveillance data, with the most common use being the tracking of disease trends, followed by monitoring variants, detecting diseases early, and assessing public health interventions. Some counties were sharing wastewater surveillance data with hospitals, which use the data for planning purposes. Public health communication was the most commonly reported action taken from wastewater surveillance data. These findings highlight that local health departments generally have favorable attitudes toward wastewater surveillance. However, there is a need for continued training and support for local health departments to apply these data in their practice.",

    "abstract": "Studies elucidating the risk factors for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections or assessing effectiveness of vaccination on acquisition prevention throughout the pandemic period are scarce. Here, we aimed to identify individual- and care-related risk factors and study the association between vaccination and risk of infection for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections. We performed a nested case-control study of patients aged ≥ 18 years hospitalised in Region Stockholm, between 1 March 2020 -15 November 2023. Each case was matched to up to 10 controls, on admission date, time period, and length of stay. Individual factors of sex, age, region of birth, education level, comorbidities and care-related factors such as number of transfers during care episode, surgery status, type of hospital unit and hospitals in the region were assessed. Vaccine effectiveness was assessed for number of doses and time since last vaccination. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio for risk factors and vaccine effectiveness. Among 2711 cases and 27,065 matched controls, older age (90 + years: 4.11 [2.71-6.23]), male sex (1.11 [1.02-1.21]) and chronic lung disease (1.25 [1.12 to 1.40]) were associated with increased odds of nosocomial infection. Among care-related factors, admission to geriatric hospital units (1.54 [1.26-1.89]) and increased number of transfers (2 + transfers: 2.48 [1.89-2.34]) were associated with higher odds. Overall, while vaccination with 2 or more doses and any time since last dose compared to being unvaccinated was associated with lower odds of infections, we observed that vaccination with 3 doses (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.46-0.67), and those with their latest dose administered within the last 3 months had the lowest odds of infection (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.59). We demonstrated that vaccination is effective in reducing the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, and preventive measures during early phases of pandemics should focus on high-risk patient groups. Risk of infection can be further reduced by focusing on high-risk areas within hospital settings and by reducing patient transfers during their care episode.",

    "abstract": "People who are pregnant while incarcerated are a high-risk population with complex and often unmet health care needs. Although perinatal support programs are becoming more common in carceral settings, limited research has examined individuals' interest in and experiences with these programs. This study explored formerly incarcerated perinatal individuals' knowledge about, participation in, and perceptions of currently existing and potential future components of a perinatal support program in a Mid-southern women's state prison. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals who were incarcerated during pregnancy (N = 15; 100% identified as women; 66.7% white), the majority of whom gave birth while in custody (n = 13; 86.7%). Participants were asked about three existing elements of the program (support group, lactation, childbirth education), and a hypothetical fourth element, doula support. Data was analyzed using a qualitative description approach via MAXQDA. Most women viewed the program positively and expressed satisfaction with the program. Nearly all women participated in at least one program component; fourteen (93.3%) participated in the support group and two (13.3%) participated in lactation. Most of the thirteen women who did not participate in lactation reported this was due to ineligibility per institutional policies (69.2%), but some indicated non-participation was due to personal choice (23.1%) or not knowing that lactation was offered (7.7%). Seven of the nine women who were ineligible for lactation (77.8%) expressed desire to participate if eligible. While the childbirth education component was ultimately found to be unavailable during incarceration for most women who were interviewed due consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the great majority of women (86.7%) indicated they would have participated had it been offered. Nearly all women (93.3%) also reported interest in a hypothetical doula support component to the program should it become available. Incarcerated perinatal individuals are both interested in and voluntarily participate in prison-based perinatal support programs and view these services as acceptable and beneficial to their needs. Findings highlight the importance of expanding access and addressing institutional barriers to improve perinatal care within these settings.",

    "title": "Analysis of factors driving HPV vaccination coverage and associated cost savings in the united States.",
    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States (U.S.) and has a significant healthcare burden and cost due to HPV-related cancers and diseases. Despite the proven safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, its uptake in the U.S remains suboptimal. Furthermore, the combined influence of individual, social, and policy factors on HPV vaccination rates remains unclear. This study investigated how individual, social, and policy factors affect HPV vaccination rates, focusing on initiation and completion rates in the U.S. It also aimed to assess the potential cost savings from implementing certain recommended policy changes, aiming to boost HPV vaccination rates and subsequently lower HPV-related cancer cases. We analyzed publicly available data on population demographics (e.g., children's public insurance coverage status, parental education, and rurality), policy, and access (e.g., Medicaid income eligibility criteria for children, state-level vaccine requirement, vaccine exemption status, access to pediatricians, access to Vaccine for Children (VFC) providers, and meningococcal conjugate vaccine uptake among adolescents) to quantify the impact of these factors on HPV vaccination coverage using a multilevel regression analysis. Using the regression results, we conducted a cost-savings analysis of higher HPV vaccine uptake and reduced HPV-related cancer incidence resulting from policy changes. The results revealed that meningococcal vaccination uptake, Medicaid income eligibility among children, parental education, and public insurance coverage increased HPV vaccination initiation by 0.028-0.53% points, and completion by 0.033-0.63% points. Vaccine requirements, rurality, and the COVID-19 mortality rate were negatively associated with uptake. Increasing meningococcal conjugate vaccine uptake by 1%, broadening Medicaid income eligibility criteria to 200% of the Federal Poverty Line for states below the threshold, and adding one pediatrician and VFC provider per 100,000 children could collectively reduce national direct two-year cancer treatment expenditures by $19 million to $24 million. The findings suggest that improving policy and access factors could significantly increase HPV vaccination coverage and generate cost savings. Future research should incorporate long-term and indirect costs to capture the full-scale cost savings related to HPV vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients recovers from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without obvious sequelae, but a significant proportion suffers long-term consequences which have been termed post COVID syndrome (PCS). Despite a wide range of considerations on treatment options in PCS and a significant number of trials initiated, only very few results from randomized controlled trials are currently available. In conclusion, there is an evident medical need to identify treatments for patients with PCS. The primary objective of the platform trial RAPID is to assess the impact of different PCS treatments on the overall physical function of patients. Designed as a master protocol, RAPID contains all information that is generic to this adaptive platform trial. Current and future study treatments are specified in intervention-specific appendices (ISA). The first ISA, RAPID_REVIVE is presented in this manuscript. General sections of the master protocol are named as such. RAPID_REVIVE is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial evaluating antiviral PCS treatment with vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838). Patients are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 45 mg/day vidofludimus calcium (22.5 mg for the first 7 days) or placebo during an initialization phase and thereafter using a response-adaptive randomization procedure. The trial includes a screening period of 7 days, a double-blind treatment period of 56 days and a follow-up period of 28 days. The primary outcome is the intra-patient change in physical function measured by the Short Form-36 Physical Function (SF-36-PF) from baseline to day 56. Secondary endpoints include mental and physical health, intensity of fatigue, severity of mental disorder symptoms, and cognitive function. PCS is a major problem for global health care and the identification of treatment options is urgently needed. Currently, PCS patients are in a situation without evidence-based treatment options, and quality of life, and often mental health are significantly impaired. The purpose of RAPID is to establish an adaptive platform trial protocol which will concert and quicken clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different potential treatments for PCS with the aim to expand the very limited evidence base for the treatment of PCS.

    "abstract": "Burnout is a prevalent occupational phenomenon among healthcare workers. To evaluate the current evidence on nurses' burnout and the impact of turnover intention during the pandemic is imperative. We aimed to comprehensively synthesize and quantify the impact of health emergencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on nurses' burnout and identify factors associated with the negative impact. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO (ASP), Cochrane Library, and supplemented by a manual search, for publications from December 2019 to February 2023. A total of 176 articles involving 110,316 nurses were identified. The overall pooled estimate of the prevalence of burnout was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42-55%). The mean score for overall burnout on the 22-item (7-point) Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was 59.83 (95% CI 49.33 to 70.34). In the work environment, nurses who were exposed to COVID-19 (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.33) or worked in emergency departments and ICUs (SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) scored higher for burnout compared to those in general wards. In the presence of increased burnout, overall burnout in nurses was associated with a sevenfold increase in depression (OR 7.40, 95% CI 3.82 to 14.35), a fourfold increase in anxiety (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.15 to 7.98) and stress (OR 4.60, 95% CI 2.31 to 9.17), and a fourfold increase in low resilience (OR 4.06, 95% CI 2.13 to 7.76) in mental health outcomes. As burnout increased, turnover intention was nearly four times as likely compared with retention (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.73 to 7.28), and it was related to the quality of care. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that half of the nurses experienced burnout during the COVID-19. Nurses' burnout is associated with the sustainability of healthcare organizations. Healthcare organizations and societies should invest more time and effort in implementing evidence-based strategies to mitigate nurses' burnout across specialties, especially in emergency medicine and for younger nurses in specialized departments, to better prepare for future public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, there has been a notable shift in the landscape of statistical and data science research, with increasing attention directed toward the development of advanced probability distributions aimed at addressing the challenges posed by medical and health-related data. In response to this need, the present study introduces a novel probability distribution model termed as the Exponentiated Odd Lomax Power Lindley distribution constructed by embedding the Power Lindley distribution within the Lomax family framework through the T-X transformation technique. This article delves into the application of probability distributions in medical data analysis, with a special focus on their role in understanding and managing the COVID-19 data. A comprehensive theoretical investigation is conducted, deriving key statistical properties including the probability and cumulative distribution functions, reliability functions, moments, moment generating function, order statistics, and entropy measures. To ensure accurate parameter estimation, several estimation methods are employed and rigorously compared through simulation studies. The real-world applicability of the developed distribution is illustrated through the modelling of COVID-19 datasets, where its performance is evaluated against a range of well-established probability distribution models. Empirical findings demonstrate the superior adaptability and modelling accuracy of the distribution while analysing real-world datasets.",

Our previous study showed a 22% median increase in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese individuals at 12 months post-infection compared to acute infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between various subsets of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8 + T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year post-infection follow-up period. A nested case control study of 47 COVID-19 patients was followed for 12 months post-infection and categorized into three groups based on obesity and changes in HOMA-IR at one year: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Increased HOMA-IR was defined as a HOMA-IR ratio (12-month to 1-month convalescence phase) > 1.21. To study antigen-specific responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s were isolated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigens for 24 h. Intracellular IFN-γ expression, as well as exhaustion and senescence markers, in various CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The abundance of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (p < 0.05). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ T cells from the 3rd to the 9th month of the convalescence phase (p < 0.05). A reduced proportion of functional (PD-1-CD57-) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed in O-IR group. Furthermore, the reduced proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells observed within 12 months of convalescence were have significant weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio as well as HOMA-IR value. Our study demonstrates that obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR exhibited a reduced proportion of IFN-γ-expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells one year after COVID-19. This reduction, along with the decreased frequencies of both functional CD4⁺ within 12 months of convalescence, suggests a potential association between impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell function and the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The transition of SARS-CoV-2 into a recurrent, seasonal pathogen has underscored the need for the induction of durable immune protection. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is regarded as a promising complementary target for therapeutic and vaccine strategies, owing to its structural robustness, clinical relevance, and ability to elicit critical immune response. Within the N protein, the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) plays a pivotal role in assembly of viral RNA (vRNA)-N protein complexes, and in facilitating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) through specific interactions with RNA on its dimerization surface. Despite its functional importance, the molecular mechanisms by which the RNA-binding surface of this domain can be selectively targeted by inhibitors remain poorly defined. Herein, we report a 2.06 Å crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N-CTD in complex with nCoV400Fab, a human monoclonal antibody derived from single B-cell screening. The structure reveals that nCoV400Fab engages multiple basic residues on the RNA-binding surface, forming a steric blockade that hinders vRNA binding. Functional assays demonstrate that nCoV400Fab disrupts both viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) assembly and RNA-induced condensate formation. Together, these findings define a structural mechanism by which a human antibody disrupts the RNA-binding surface of N-CTD, laying the foundation for the development of macromolecular inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, people believing in political COVID-19 conspiracies likely perceived that the government executed power unfairly (i.e., low procedural justice), which might have contributed to the questioning of the government's legitimacy. This study examines the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and perceived procedural justice regarding COVID-19 policies during the peak and decay of the pandemic (May/June 2022-September 2023). Additionally, we considered the moderating role of economic and health threat. We tested our hypotheses using data from a five-wave study (N = 4939, quota-based). Latent growth curve analysis revealed a negative relationship between conspiracy beliefs (at Time 1) and the starting value of procedural justice (i.e., intercept). Furthermore, conspiracy beliefs were also negatively related to the change of procedural justice over time (i.e., slope): the lower people's conspiracy beliefs at Time 1, the steeper their increase in procedural justice over time. Health threat weakened the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and the intercept of procedural justice, implying that people with stronger conspiracy beliefs reported lower resentment against COVID-19 policies the more they perceived health threat. Results show the effects of conspiracy beliefs on procedural justice throughout and potentially also beyond the pandemic, while also pointing to important moderators.",

In March 2020, three clinical researchers constructed a digital platform to facilitate communication among physiotherapists at a national level in Sweden. The purpose of this study is to describe the development process of the Swedish Physiotherapy Platform (SwePPt) and further, to evaluate the need for support and knowledge for physiotherapists in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive study, containing a process evaluation based on retrospective quantitative and qualitative data from the platform, field notes, memos and a digital survey about the use of the platform. From April 2020 to January 2023, 26 webinars were held, reaching a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 204 computers. A total of 1854 visitors registered at SwePPt. The visitors represented 20 of 21 regions of Sweden and worked in hospitals, regional or municipal primary health care, private care, and other areas. The survey was answered by 228 participants (86% female, mean 51 (9.2) years) with 98% being physiotherapists. The majority (28.9%), worked in hospitals. Material from the SwePPt was used in clinical everyday life, as reported by 89%, and 61% downloaded materials related to treatment methods (80%), assessment instruments (61%) and articles (50%) and 70% reported they shared the information with others. The evaluation of the SwePPt discovered that the digital platform was an important source of reliable, up-to-date knowledge and was used to facilitate clinical knowledge mobilization. Furthermore, it is recommended to establish a structured approach for knowledge sharing to be prepared for future crises.

    "title": "Using the Community Perception Tracker (CPT) to inform COVID-19 response in Lebanon and Zimbabwe: a qualitative methods evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Despite the recognized importance of community engagement during disease outbreaks, methods describing how to operationalise engagement are lacking. The Community Perception Tracker (CPT) was designed by Oxfam to systematically record real-time information on disease perceptions and outbreak response actions in order to adapt programmes. We conducted a phased, qualitative methods, process evaluation in Zimbabwe and Lebanon to understand whether the CPT approach was a feasible way to incorporate community perceptions into COVID-19 response programming and whether this resulted in more relevant programming. We conducted 3 rounds of interviews with 15 staff using the CPT, analysed programmatic data, and conducted multiple rounds of phone-based interviews with outbreak-affected populations (41 to 50 participants per country each round). Qualitative data were thematically analysed and quantitative data descriptively summarized. Initially CPT implementing staff struggled to differentiate how the CPT differed from other monitoring tools that they were familiar with and felt that the training did not convey the full process and its value. However, with practise, collaboration and iterative improvements to the recommended CPT steps, staff found the process to be feasible and a significant value-add to their programming. Staff initially focused more on quantitively summarizing perceptions but eventually developed processes for maximizing the qualitative data on perceptions too. Trends emerging from the CPT led to frequent programmatic tweaks to COVID-19 messaging and product distributions. Emergent trends in perceptions also led staff to work cross-sectorally and advocate to other actors on behalf of populations. Outbreak-affected populations exposed to the programmes reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 and reported they practiced preventative behaviours, although this waned with time. Most population members also felt the COVID-19 programmes were relevant to their needs and said that non-government organisations were a trusted source of information. The CPT appears to be a promising approach for ensuring that community engagement is undertaken systematically and that community perspectives are actively incorporated to improve programming. While crisis-affected populations generally found the programmes to be useful and relevant and to have influenced their knowledge and behaviours, it is not possible to attribute this to the CPT approach due to the study design.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections are recognized as common triggers of alveolar hemorrhage episodes in pediatric diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). However, comprehensive studies investigating this association in detail remain limited. The aim of this study was to explore the etiological spectrum, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of the respiratory infection induced episode of alveolar hemorrhage (RIIEAH) in the pediatric DAH. The children of DAH who had RIIEAH and a definite etiological diagnosis were included. All the subjects had been hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2023 to February 2024. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted. 1. A total of 21 RIIEAHs were included, in which 12 RIIEAHs occurred at the unstable stage, 6 RIIEAHs occurred at the stable stage and 3 RIIEAHs occurred at the end stage. 2. Various pathogens could result in RIIEAHs including mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 7), coronavirus (n = 3), haemophilus influenzae (n = 3), chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 2), human metapneumovirus (n = 2), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), pueumocystis carinii (n = 1) and mixed pathogens (n = 2). 3. The majority of the RIIEAHs (n = 19) presented with prodromal symptoms. Clinical manifestations of RIIEAHs included worsening anemia (n = 13), hemoptysis (n = 13), bleeding on bronchoscopy (n = 12) and dyspnea (n = 9). 4. An intensive glucocorticoid therapy was administrated in the 19 RIIEAHs, in which 18 RIIEAHs resolved. RIIEAH can be caused by various pathogens at any disease stage of pediatric DAH and an intensive glucocorticoid therapy seems to be effective for this condition.",

    "title": "Favorable responses to upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, in long COVID patients with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms: case reports in 2 autistic patients and one typically developing patient.",
    "abstract": "The long-term impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become evident over the past 3-4 years, with the recognition of post-COVID long-term sequelae, often referred to as long COVID. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are one of the hallmarks of long COVID. In severe cases, it can even present features of encephalopathy. Since some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with long COVID overlap symptoms found in neuropsychiatric disorders, it has been difficult to sort out the effects of long COVID in such subjects. This is especially true in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), given their difficult behavioral symptoms and other co-morbid conditions. COVID-19 is thought to affect the onset or progress of encephalopathy symptoms by activation of the immune system through the type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. In that case, treatment would require an immunomodulating agent that targets such pathways. However, such measures may not be applied to ASD subjects, in whom long COVID may not even be considered as the cause of their symptoms. In this study, we present the beneficial effects of upadacitinib, a JAK (janus kinase) 1 inhibitor, that blocks downstream signaling of type 1 IFNs, on 3 patients, 2 with ASD and one without ASD. In these patients, long COVID was thought to have triggered or aggravated encephalopathy-like symptoms. The beneficial effects of upadacitinib were not only noted by an improvement of their behavioral symptoms but also shown by an improvement of monocyte cytokine profiles (less activated state); peripheral blood monocytes were used as surrogates of microglial cells. These three cases presented highlight a possible use of JAK inhibitors for treating long COVID-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms in both ASD and non-ASD subjects. The presented cases highlight the inherent difficulty of diagnosing long COVID in ASD cases.",

    "title": "The silent legacy of COVID-19: exploring genomic instability in long-term COVID-19 survivors.",
    "abstract": "Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlates of health behaviors and their changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A population-based sample of children (3-17 years) was randomly selected between 12/2021 and 06/2022 in Geneva, Switzerland. Parents reported about children's screen time, physical activity, green spaces time, sleep duration, and whether these changed due to the pandemic. Socio-demographic correlates of changes in health behavior and adherence to corresponding recommendations were evaluated. Of 2104 children, approximately 1/3 did not meet screen or physical activity recommendations, 22% did not sleep sufficiently. Older children and girls were less likely to meet behavior recommendations. During the pandemic, physical activity, green spaces time and sleep quality remained unchanged for most children (72.9%, 72.2% and 93.1%, respectively), while 51.9% experienced an increase in screen time. Older age was associated with a worsening of health behaviors, while children from disadvantaged households were more likely to experience any changes, whether positive or negative. Between 20% and 30% of children fail to meet health behavior recommendations. The COVID-19 pandemic possibly exacerbated existing disparities among older and socio-economically disadvantaged children, although positive changes were also reported. Continuous monitoring and targeted interventions are crucial to promoting healthy lifestyles among youth in the post-pandemic period.",

    "abstract": "The current gold standard of blood sample collection in clinical trials involves venous draws performed by trained phlebotomists in clinical settings. However, recent technological advancements have enabled the emergence of patient-centric sampling (PCS) methods, offering more flexible and accessible alternatives. This paper examines the motivation behind the pharmaceutical industry's growing interest in PCS devices and explores their application in drug development through seven case studies. The case studies highlight the benefits and practical challenges of PCS strategies, including remote (at-home) sample collection, use in pediatric populations, advantages during COVID-19 pandemic, and implementation across trials involving small molecules, biotherapeutics, biomarkers and vaccines. Several studies assess the concordance between traditional venous sampling and PCS methods, while also addressing logistical considerations for remote sampling with and without nurse support. A central theme across the case studies is the importance of designing trials that prioritize patient convenience and engagement. Examples such as an early-phase asthma trial exemplify how PCS can enhance study design. The findings underscore the clear advantages of PCS in improving trial recruitment, increasing participant diversity, minimizing discomfort, reducing sample volumes and enhancing operational efficiency. The paper provides practical insights and recent examples to guide the integration of PCS technologies into clinical trial protocols, emphasizing the value of early planning and strategic implementation.",

We performed whole-genome sequencing on 235 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples collected across Morocco between 2021 and 2024 to characterize viral evolution and variant dynamics. Our analysis revealed a temporal shift in variant prevalence that paralleled global trends: initial co-circulation of Alpha and Delta variants, followed by complete replacement by Omicron and its sub-lineages in 2022. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified key mutations associated with enhanced immune evasion and transmissibility, demonstrating the virus's adaptive capacity. These findings underscore the critical importance of sustained genomic surveillance for monitoring viral evolution, informing vaccine and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health responses.

This study evaluates the performance of noninvasive devices for assessing tissue oxygenation in a cohort of 20 healthy individuals, with a focus on device sensitivity, physiological and demographic variables. Tissue oxygenation was measured using devices: spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TCOM), wearable photoplethysmography (WD), and pulse oximetry (PO) during baseline, ischemia, and reperfusion phases. Comparative analyses were performed across devices, sex and Fitzpatrick skin types. Among the four devices, SFDI uniquely detected significant differences in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), highlighting its sensitivity to tissue heterogeneity. PO and WD data showed moderate correlation (r = 0.44-0.59); SFDI and TCOM demonstrated fair correlation (r = 0.23-0.36). Although sex-based differences were minimal, the SFDI revealed significantly different recovery metrics. Notably, SFDI provided deeper insights into hemoglobin dynamics (HbO2, dHb, HbP1, HbP2), which was not captured by point-measurement devices. Results demonstrated that SFDI offers superior spatial/spectral resolution for mapping tissue oxygenation, particularly in detecting skin-type variations. However, device-specific limitations such as motion artifacts and melanin interference necessitate further optimization. This work supports the development of more inclusive and accurate non-invasive monitoring tools for clinical use.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05784103.",

    "abstract": "Crises like the COVID-19 pandemic are inherently uncertain, dynamic and generate broader consequences on organisations, challenging traditional crisis management approaches. Conventional approaches often neglect the mechanisms and processes frontline practitioners enact in their local practices to adapt effectively. This study explores how healthcare professionals (HPs) at a university hospital centre developed and mobilised local knowledge to rapidly respond to the evolving conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an interpretive single case study at a designated COVID-19 university hospital in Montreal, Canada. Over 6 months (April to September 2020), we collected data through 49 virtual interviews with healthcare practitioners, minutes from an operational crisis unit and organisational records such as protocols and clinical algorithms. Our analysis focused on identifying spaces and mechanisms that facilitated the creation, testing and translation of local knowledge across different clinical units, leading to rapid organisational adaptation. The study reveals that frontline HPs enacted new mechanisms forming three types of spaces-reflective, experimental and translational-that bypassed existing organisational structures of knowledge development. These spaces enabled the rapid development and translation of local knowledge, fostering dynamic organisational responses to the evolving crisis. By highlighting the critical role of local knowledge and the processes supporting its integration, this research offers valuable insights into improving crisis management practices. It emphasises frontline practitioners' improvised and flexible organising processes that enable a more global capacity to leverage local knowledge for the effective adaptation in unprecedented crisis situations.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined social inequalities in suicide by comparing the COVID-19 pandemic with previous years. These studies, largely concentrated on high-income countries, have produced mixed results and have not included post-pandemic years in their analyses. Our objective was to analyse social inequalities in suicide across Argentine provinces during the period 2015-2023. This is a retrospective quantitative study based on secondary data analysis. We employed Poisson regressions to model the temporal trends in suicide rates by educational level in the provinces of Jujuy, Mendoza and San Juan from 2015 to 2023. Additionally, we calculated suicide rate ratios to examine temporal variations in relative inequalities by educational level. Compared with those with medium-high education, individuals with low education-across sexes, men and the 25-44 age group-had higher suicide risk in all years except 2021. During the pandemic, women's educational mortality ratios fell below 1, contrasting with prepandemic (2015-2019) and postrestrictions (2022-2023) periods. For men, suicide rate ratios exceeded 1 in all periods but were smaller during and after the pandemic. The 25-44 age group mirrored men's pattern, while the 45+ group showed no educational inequalities in suicide during and after the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic appeared to temporarily narrow the social suicide gap, though variations by sex and age were observed. This potential effect of the pandemic seemed to be short-lived, with the 2022-2023 period showing a return to prepandemic levels of social inequalities in suicide.",

While elevated PTX3 levels have been observed in various infection states, its utility in monitoring treatment response in pulmonary aspergillosis remains underexplored. We assessed serial PTX3 levels in total 216 patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA, n = 48) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA, n = 48) before and after antifungal therapy. Comparative groups included controls (n = 69), COVID-19 patients (n = 36), and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA, n = 15). Serum PTX3 concentrations were measured by ELISA and analyzed in relation to treatment response. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation under various stimuli was evaluated and correlated with PTX3 levels to explore immune activation patterns. PTX3 levels were significantly elevated in CPA and IPA compared to controls. Among patients with serial samples, PTX3 levels declined significantly in favorable responders (from 299.0 [119.5-477.0] to 138.3 [80.9-386.1] pg/mL; p < 0.05), but increased in unfavorable responders (from 177.1 [117.8-318.8] to 243.0 [169.5-488.4] pg/mL; p < 0.05). PTX3 changes correlated with disease course and NET responses in a phenotype-specific manner. Serial measurement of PTX3 may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring treatment response in pulmonary aspergillosis. PTX3 dynamics reflect underlying immune activity and may aid in identifying disease progression or relapse.",

    "abstract": "Early warning signals (EWSs) are vital for implementing preventive measures before a disease turns into a pandemic. While new diseases exhibit unique behaviours, they often share fundamental characteristics from a dynamical systems perspective. Moreover, measurements during disease outbreaks are often corrupted by different noise sources, posing challenges for time-series classification (TSC) tasks. In this study, we address the problem of having a robust EWS for disease outbreak prediction using a parallel long short-term memory-convolutional neural network deep learning model in the domain of TSC. We employed two simulated datasets to train the model: one representing generated dynamical systems with randomly selected polynomial terms to model new disease behaviours, and another simulating noise-induced disease dynamics to account for noisy measurements. The model's performance was analysed using both simulated data from different disease models and real-world data, including influenza, COVID-19 and monkeypox. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous models and statistical indicators in most of the datasets, effectively providing EWSs of impending outbreaks across various scenarios. This study bridges advancements in deep learning with the ability to provide improved EWSs in noisy environments, making it highly applicable to real-world crises involving emerging disease outbreaks.",

It is associated with low potassium levels due to defects in muscle ion channels. HPP can be life-threatening, but it can be completely reversed if diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly. Pathogenic variants in a heterozygous in the CACNA1S or SCN4A genes lead to HPP. We present a 16-year-old male with a clinical history of flaccid paralysis associated with hypokalemia following intense physical activity and subsequent COVID-19 infection. During this evaluation, his 12-year-old maternal half-brother exhibited similar symptoms related to intense physical exercise. The affected mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandfather have variable clinical histories. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous pathogenic variation in the CACNA1S gene (c.2700G>A; p.Arg900Ser) in the patient, his mother, and maternal half-brother. The availability of a positive family history facilitates diagnostic guidance and provides insight into the factors triggering crises.

Ecological time-series study design. Daily COVID-19 case notifications, temperature and public health intervention data were collected for Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane cities. Time series cross-correlation (TSCC) analysis was used to explore temporal patterns and trends between cities. Seasonal decomposition analysis was used to explore trends and seasonality of the time series, followed by multivariable regression to explore the inter-city relationship while accounting for seasonality and trends. TSCC analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 cases in Sydney and Melbourne (r = 0.886, p < .0001) with a 5-day lag, Sydney and Brisbane with a 7-day lag (r = 0.945, p < .0001) and between Melbourne and Brisbane up to 5 days lag, with the strongest correlation occurring at lag 0 (r = 0.912, p < .0001).

A retrospective chart review was completed for congenitally deafened children (n = 102) age 0-18 years who underwent first ear CI at our clinic. Patients were stratified into pre- (n = 49) and post- (n = 53) COVID-19 pandemic groups for analysis. Most patients were male (54.9 %), Hispanic (62.7 %), White (72.5 %), and had Medicaid/Managed care insurance (67.6 %). Over half listed English as their primary language (55.9 %) followed by Spanish (38.2 %). Most had an etiology of HL due to hereditary/genetic factors (73.6 %). Initial analyses between demographic factors (e.g., ethnicity, primary language) and outcome variables revealed no significant differences. No significant differences were found in pre- and post-COVID groups in time between HL evaluation and CI evaluation, time between HL evaluation and first ear CI, and in mean age at first ear CI between the pre- and post-COVID groups. Interestingly, differences in time between first HL evaluation at our clinic and second ear CI surgery pre- and post-COVID were found, with patients pre-COVID undergoing their second CI surgery approximately 7 months later than the patients post-COVID (M = 17.66 months, SD = 15.66; M = 10.76, SD = 10.62). COVID-19 did not negatively impact our timeline from diagnosis to CI for children with congenital HL. In fact, time between 1st and 2nd sequential CI improved post-COVID and provided quicker access to binaural hearing. Additionally, our English and Spanish speaking groups had equitable access pre- and post-COVID to audiological and HL treatment services regardless of preferred language. Overall, actions taken to minimize the impact of COVID restrictions allowed our clinic to maintain and, in some areas, improve access to CI for children with congenital HL from a diverse patient population.",

The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected this vulnerable population, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Immune dysfunction in CKD patients contributes to a suboptimal defense against infections and a reduced response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Although vaccination has significantly reduced severe outcomes, dialysis patients and KTRs exhibit lower seroconversion rates and faster antibody waning compared to the general population. Recent evidence suggests that booster doses improve immune responses, but vaccine efficacy remains lower in immunosuppressed individuals. This review highlights the epidemiology of COVID-19 in nephropathic patients, the mechanisms underlying their immune dysregulation, and the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Future directions include optimizing booster regimens, integrating serological and avidity testing to tailor vaccination strategies, and exploring novel immunotherapeutic approaches. A multidisciplinary effort involving nephrologists, immunologists, and public health experts is essential to improve pandemic preparedness and develop targeted strategies to protect nephropathic patients from future viral threats.",

    "abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology has become a powerful tool for studying molecular interactions due to its label-free, real-time detection capabilities. However, the sensitivity limitations of conventional SPR have restricted its broader application. In response to this challenge, our study introduces an optical optimization, the photoluminescent-boosted Metasurface plasmon resonance (PLMLMSPR), which integrates photoluminescent molecule materials with a multilayer metal-enhanced metasurface plasmon resonance (MLM-MetaSPR) chip. Building upon the optimization of the nanocup array structure and multilayer metal composition, the metasurface chip is modified with a three-dimensional scaffold of carboxymethyl chitosan via carbene photopolymerization, further enhancing both protein immobilization and sensor sensitivity. Leveraging the metasurface chip, the photoluminescent molecule is labeled onto the antibody for signal amplification through a sandwich immunoassay system, achieving the ultra-sensitive PLMLMSPR platform. The incorporation of photoluminescent materials successfully harnessed nonradiative energy transfer to augment the local free electric field through enhanced transmission by absorbance of a photon, thereby significantly enhancing the plasmonic resonance effect in MetaSPR technology. This approach has doubled the sensor's response signal and improved the detection limit fourfold while maintaining protein-ligand affinity, as demonstrated by the effective detection of both SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and emerging variants, highlighting its remarkable practicality in diagnostic applications.",

    "title": "Validation of the Danish translation of the vaccination attitudes examination (VAX) scale.",
    "abstract": "Short and valid instruments measuring vaccination attitudes across countries are limited. The recently developed 12-item Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale measures vaccination hesitancy and consists of four subscales: (1) mistrust of vaccine benefits, (2) worries over unforeseen future effects, (3) concerns about commercial profiteering, and (4) preference for natural immunity. The original English version has been translated and validated in different languages. This study aimed to validate the Danish translation of the VAX scale. The Danish translation of the VAX scale was distributed to Danish citizens using social media via the online survey system SurveyXact. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) examined the factor structure. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated for the entire scale and all subscales. Known group validity was tested using vaccination status. Criterion validity was assessed using the beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ). Analysis of responses from 194 participants revealed an adequate four-subscale construct (GFI = 0.939, AGFI = 0.901, NFI = 0.955, TLI = 0.976, CFI = 0.982, RMSEA = 0.056, SRMR = 0.037, p = 0.005) and a high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α 0.934 for the entire scale, 0.920, 0.824, 0.833, and 0.899 for the four subscales, respectively). COVID-19 vaccinated participants showed significantly lower VAX scale scores (Mean(SD) = 2.36(0.83)) compared to non-vaccinated (Mean(SD) = 4.88(0.93)). A significant correlation was found with BMQ-general (r = -0.716, p < 0.01). The Danish translation of the VAX scale demonstrated a well-defined four-factor structure with high internal consistency, known group validity, and criterion validity. It is a useful tool to measure vaccination hesitancy in Denmark.",

    "title": "CRISPR-based molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, its emerging variants, and diverse pathogens.",
    "abstract": "Pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV-2), continue to pose a significant threat to human civilization. The lessons learnt from SCoV-2 infections have highlighted the requirement for robust and readily available diagnostic tools in order to limit the virus transmission and prevent future pandemics such as COVID-19. RT-qPCR-based detection is routinely used for sensitive and accurate diagnosis, which requires a sophisticated instrument, laboratory setup, and technical expertise. Though RT-qPCR is highly reliable and considered the gold standard for pathogen detection, it is costly, time-consuming, and unaffordable for the masses. Therefore, other reliable methods for nucleic acid-based detection with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy on-par with RT-qPCR are required. Recent advancement in CRISPR technology promises its development as a POC testing device, providing a high-end, instrument-free, portable, and cost-effective workflow. Further, COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged the development of next-generation CRISPR-based diagnostics with a provision for home-testing which has resulted in the development of portable and smart-phone integrated hand-held devices which can detect various pathogenic infections in a shorter time frame than RT-qPCR. For diagnosing the presence of SCoV-2, CRISPR-based diagnostics (SHERLOCK/DETECTR) are quicker (30-60 min), less expensive ($5-15/test), and portable than RT-qPCR (90-180 min; $10-50/test) demonstrating equivalent specificity (100%) and near-equivalent sensitivity (93-100% for CRISPR-based diagnostics vs 95-100% for RT-qPCR). For high-sensitivity centralized testing, RT-qPCR is still the gold standard, but CRISPR works well in point-of-care settings because it requires little equipment (like lateral flow strips or heating blocks) and allows multiplexing. CRISPR-based diagnostics breakthrough platform like CARMEN leverages microfluidic technology to test 5,000 plus samples in a single run, unlike RT-qPCR, which requires separate reactions for each target.In this review, the advancement in CRISPR technology such as SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and other Cas-9-based diagnostics are highlighted which exclusively focuses on the CRISPR-based diagnostics to detect SCoV-2 and its emerging VOCs, highlighting their advantages and limitations compared to the gold-standard RT-qPCR.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccination may alter the course of severe disease and influence hospital discharge costs. This study compares hospital discharge costs among ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients based on vaccination status, adjusted for All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) and severity. A retrospective study (March 2020-March 2022) was conducted in an ICU, categorizing patients into three groups: unvaccinated, fully vaccinated, and partially vaccinated. Full vaccination included all required doses and boosters per the vaccination schedule. Disease severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Direct hospital costs, including ICU stay, medical procedures, medications, and life support, were analysed using data from Order SAN/35/2017, adjusted for inflation. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons. A total of 456 patients were included: 262 (57%) unvaccinated, 32 (7%) partially vaccinated, and 162 (35%) fully vaccinated. Median costs were: Unvaccinated: €10,653 (IQR: €6160-€18,274) Partially vaccinated: €17,360 (IQR: €5061-€26,085) Fully vaccinated: €10,653 (IQR: €6160-€26,085) Cost differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.28). Critical severity patients had the highest costs, while mild cases had the lowest (p < 0.05). No significant cost differences were found within each severity level or in APR-DRG relative weight (p = 0.38). No significant differences in hospital discharge costs by APR-DRG were found based on vaccination status. However, vaccination may reduce disease severity and the need for intensive resources, with potential economic and clinical implications for future research.",

    "abstract": "Financial relationships between medical device companies and medical professionals can lead to inappropriate medical care and generate ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest. Monitoring this relationship is paramount to ensure that patients receive optimal and affordable care and that costs for medical services are not unnecessarily increased. In this study, we aimed to characterise the payments reported by each company that manufactures vascular embolisation devices to medical professionals and institutions in Japan and evaluate the system of industry payment disclosure. This study of industrial payments in the field of intravascular embolisation included a review of disclosed payment data from companies that sell vascular embolisation devices. The payment information reported for the fiscal years 2019-2023 by each company was collected. We evaluated the payment amounts and assessed the data accessibility and quality of industry payment information as secondary outcomes. Eighteen companies that sold intravascular embolisation devices disclosed their payment information and were evaluated in this study. Payments per company were the highest in 2019 ($13.0 million) and the lowest in 2020 ($9.06 million) when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred: however, they have continually increased since then. All companies received low scores for one quality measure and two accessibility measures. The payments from vascular embolisation device industry to medical professionals and institutions increased annually from 2020 to 2023 in Japan. Industry payment disclosures published voluntarily by vascular embolisation device companies showed limitations in both transparency and accessibility, highlighting the need for standardized reporting requirements.",

    "abstract": "While longitudinal studies in the United States and Canada show increased use of non-ionising imaging and reduced paediatric CT, recent data on imaging trends in Europe are lacking. This study examines paediatric imaging trends from 2019 to 2023 in Ireland, including age-specific patterns and procedure frequencies. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted within Irish paediatric hospitals. Data extracted from the Radiology Information Systems, including examination counts for conventional X-ray (XR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), nuclear medicine (NM), and fluoroscopically guided procedures in patients under 18 years. Examinations were categorised by modality, anatomical region, and age group. Annual imaging volumes and utilisation trends were assessed. A total of 634,770 examinations were performed: 73.7 % XR, 12.4 % US, 5.4 % MRI, 4.4 % CT, 3.4 % fluoroscopy, and 0.63 % NM. Ionising radiation was used in 82.2 % of all examinations. Imaging volumes declined by 15.2 % in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but recovered fully by 2022. From 2019 to 2023, CT (+20.3 %), US (+16.5 %), and MRI (+8.6 %) showed the highest growth. XR and ultrasound were most common in infants, while CT and MRI showed a more uniform distribution, with brain imaging being the most frequent examination for both. This contemporary multi-centre analysis of paediatric imaging in Ireland demonstrates a sustained reliance on XR and US, increasing CT utilisation, underscoring the ongoing need for justification and radiation dose optimisation in paediatric practice. It also highlights the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging trends.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the link between parental education and adolescents' COVID-19 vaccination status mostly originates from non-representative survey studies, and the results are mixed. Although some register-based studies have shown a positive association with higher parental education and adolescent COVID-19 vaccine uptake, the factors behind these differences remain largely unexplored. We used total population-level Finnish register data on 12-17-year-olds (N = 360,281) linked with their parents and household members. Logistic regression models were employed to analyse the association between parental education and the likelihood of receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine dose by the end of 2022. The Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method was used to quantify the extent to which parental age, family structure, household income, migration background, previous COVID-19 infection, presence of risk group household members, and parental COVID-19 vaccination status confounded or mediated the association. Adolescents with at least one parent with upper tertiary education had higher COVID-19 vaccine uptake (92 %) than those whose parents had only basic education (58 %), with an odds ratio [OR] of 8.60 (95 % CI 8.20-9.02) in the baseline model. Together the adjustments confounded or mediated over 80 % of the association, with parental COVID-19 vaccine uptake and household income being the strongest explanatory factors. For example, adjusting for parental COVID-19 vaccination status attenuated the OR to 3.85 (95 % CI 3.61-4.12). In the fully adjusted model, the OR remained at 1.55 (95 % CI 1.45-1.67). The results were highly similar when using household income as the socioeconomic status measure. Parental education was a strong predictor of adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Finland. Parental vaccination status emerged as an important mediator of the association, possibly indicating general vaccine hesitancy. Other factors behind the educational differences included household income, migration background, and parental age.",

    "abstract": "University students' COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and decisions are shaped by their trust in health-related information and its sources. Few studies have identified factors associated with trust in public health officials among university students. We sought to identify these factors in a representative cohort of private university undergraduates in New York State. We used two-stage sampling to recruit a representative sample of 233 private university undergraduates from January-May 2022. Students completed a cross-sectional online survey with questions on trust in public health officials, socio-demographics, and COVID-19 vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with trust in public health officials. Of 233 participants, 162 were women (73 %) and 110 were White (47 %). Three-quarters of participants had high trust in public health officials (n = 170, 76 %). Women were five times as likely (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.5, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-10.3) and White students had 60 % reduced odds (aOR = 0.4, 95 % CI: 0.2-0.9) of reporting high levels of trust in public health officials, compared to men and non-White students, respectively. Students who did not report religious concerns were three times as likely (aOR = 3.4; 95 % CI: 1.5-7.9) and students who were not concerned about long-term side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination were four times as likely (aOR = 3.5; 95 % CI: 1.4-8.8) to report high levels of trust in public health officials compared to students with concerns. Our results differed from previous findings on the effects of race/ethnicity on vaccine hesitancy and medical mistrust, potentially reflecting high education and family income, heightened risk perception among racial minorities, and effective messaging in our sample and study setting. Further targeted messaging on vaccine safety and effectiveness would benefit students, with a particular focus on men, White students, students with religious concerns regarding vaccines, and students with low trust in institutions and leaders recommending vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Research on psychological outcomes of COVID-19 has predominantly examined mental health problems, with limited focus on well-being and psychological resources. This research, in two studies, examines the salient indicators of psychological distress and well-being in the overall mental health network and further the role of psychological resources and affective well-being in young adults' academic outcomes during adversity. Study 1 explores the mental health network during COVID-19, employing a network analysis approach on a sample of 407 students in two higher educational institutions (HEIs) in India. Results reveal both well-being and psychological distress indicators, such as engagement, satisfaction with life, meaning and purpose, negative emotions, and hopelessness, remained central in the mental health network. In Study 2, using 1-year longitudinal data (four waves), two models explored the influence of reciprocal associations between affect balance and psychological resources (PsyCap and mindfulness) on psychological distress, academic engagement, and academic performance. Data were collected from 164 students in 4 different time periods. Findings show that while PsyCap and mindfulness indirectly decrease psychological distress by improving affect balance and academic engagement, academic performance is only improved through an increase in academic engagement. Improvements in affect balance did not improve academic performance. Also, experiencing more positive emotions builds PsyCap and mindfulness, which in turn improve academic performance and academic engagement. Thus, the research provides insights that both subjective and psychological well-being indicators, along with negative emotions, hopelessness, and worthlessness, are salient for the mental health of young adults and can act as protective and risk factors. Furthermore, it also shows how PsyCap, mindfulness, and positive emotions reinforce one another over time to foster healthy mental states and academic outcomes. These insights can guide education and mental health policy, research, and practice.",

    "abstract": "Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines were conditionally authorized for human use to protect against severe infection. The Benefit Risk Assessment of VaccinEs (BRAVE) toolkit, a user-friendly R Shiny application, was developed retrospectively together with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) with the aim of fulfilling the need for flexible tools to assess vaccine benefits and risks during and outside a pandemic situation. This study employed BRAVE to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines across 30 European Union (EU)/EEA countries by quantifying the number of prevented clinical events [i.e. confirmed infections, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths], using a probabilistic model informed by real-time incidence data and vaccine effectiveness estimates. The analysis assumes fixed population dynamics and behaviour. Additionally, BRAVE assesses risks associated with mRNA-based vaccines (myocarditis or pericarditis) by comparing observed incidence rates in vaccinated individuals with background incidence rates. mRNA vaccines were estimated to directly prevent 11.150 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.876-11.345] confirmed COVID-19 infections, 0.739 million (95% CI: 0.727-0.744) COVID-19 hospitalizations, 0.107 million (95% CI: 0.104-0.109) ICU admissions, and 0.187 million (95% CI: 0.182-0.189) COVID-19-related deaths in the EU/EEA between 13 December 2020 and 31 December 2021. Despite increased vaccination-associated myocarditis or pericarditis observed in younger men, the benefits of vaccination still outweigh these risks. Our study supports the benefit/risk profile of COVID-19 vaccines and emphasizes the utility of employing a flexible toolkit to assess risks and benefits of vaccination. This user-friendly and adaptable toolkit can serve as a blueprint for similar tools, enhancing preparedness for future public health crises.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a post-COVID-19 condition resembling Kawasaki disease, including developing coronary aneurysms. Optimal treatment remains uncertain. This study aims to identify effective therapies for preventing aneurysms in MIS-C and associated risk factors. This multicenter, ambispective study included hospitalized patients 0-18 years old with MIS-C between March 2020 and June 2023 from cohorts in Poland, Spain, Catalonia and Colombia. Logistic regression analyzed aneurysm risk factors. Treatment efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models, with post hoc Tukey's tests for pairwise comparisons. Among 853 patients, 33 (4%) developed aneurysms, with a median age of 5.86 years (interquartile range, 3.00-11.7). All immunomodulatory treatments reduced aneurysm risk compared with no immunomodulatory treatment: corticosteroids + intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [odds ratio (OR): 0.29; 95% confident interval (CI): 0.13-0.68], corticosteroids alone (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.04-1.02) and IVIG alone (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.18-1.28). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower 7-day aneurysm-free probability without immunomodulatory treatment (92%; 95% CI: 87%-96%, P = 0.011). Hazard ratios indicated a reduction in aneurysm risk with corticosteroids+IVIG [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.65], corticosteroids alone (HR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-1.13) and IVIG alone (HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.19-1.25), but no significant differences were observed between these treatments. No additional aneurysm risk factors were identified. Corticosteroids, IVIG and their combination appear to be protective against aneurysms in children with MIS-C compared with no immunomodulatory treatment. Although the 3 therapies showed no significant differences when compared with each other, only the combination significantly reduced the risk. Corticosteroids may still be a useful option when IVIG is limited.",

    "abstract": "Disaster telehealth can be used to provide rapid access to remote specialty expertise and virtual surge capacity for overwhelmed local clinicians. The Regional Disaster Health Response System (RDHRS) is developing a disaster teleconsultation system for cross-jurisdictional care in the United States. In 2020, the Region 1 RDHRS provided Massachusetts hospitals access to disaster teleconsultation services with out-of-state critical care experts during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic response. We aimed to field-test (1) the acceptability and feasibility of using a prototype, web-based disaster teleconsultation platform with minimal-to-no user training and (2) the feasibility of deploying a national volunteer expert pool to access out-of-state expertise. This was a prospective, mixed methods, observational study. We recruited field clinicians from Massachusetts hospitals and out-of-state critical-care physicians as experts for a 2-week pilot (June 2020). Experts were trained to use a prototype platform, while field clinicians received a just-in-time tool. Field clinicians requested teleconsultations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (clinical call) or simulated patients (test call). We collected demographics, call performance data, and Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) ratings to measure acceptability (primary outcome; total usability score ≥6 of 7) and feasibility (secondary outcome; interface, interaction quality, and reliability items), and interviewed participants. We report descriptive statistics and key themes using the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Ten experts from 6 states and 17 field clinicians from 4 hospitals participated. All experts and 10 field clinicians completed postpilot questionnaires (74% response overall). Of these, 20% had previously used telemedicine in a disaster. In total, 50 test calls and no clinical calls were logged. Most (70%) made ≥1 call; 22% (95% CI 10%-34%) connected successfully. The median time to connect was 1.6 (IQR 3.2) minutes. Among field clinician respondents, 50% used smartphone devices, 40% hospital desktop computers, and 10% laptop computers to access RDHRS teleconsultation services. Calls failed due to platform routing errors (49%), hospital computers without cameras or microphones (10%), firewalls (8%), and expert notification failures (5%). The mean total usability score was 5.6 (SD 1.3). TUQ item scores were highest in usefulness (mean 6.0, SD 1.1) and ease-of-use (mean 6.0, SD 1.4), and lowest in reliability (mean 2.4, SD 1.4). Participants were comfortable using the platform. Those with difficulty identified discomfort with technology as the cause. All experts were willing to participate in a national expert registry and obtain emergency licensure, and most (80%) were willing to serve on a volunteer, unpaid basis. Clinicians found the prototype platform acceptable, but the workflow requires revision to reduce call failure and improve feasibility and reliability for future use with minimal-to-no training. Using familiar clinical workflows for emergency consultation and mobile devices with camera and microphone capabilities could improve call performance and reliability.",

In SEQUOIA (n=127; median follow-up, 64.8 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached; estimated 60-month PFS and OS were 70.7% and 82.3%, respectively. In ALPINE (n=75, each treatment arm; median follow-up, 39.0 months), 36-month PFS rates were 59.2% among zanubrutinib-treated patients and 38.5% among ibrutinib-treated patients, and OS rates were 73.6% and 72.5%, respectively. In AU-003 (n=24; median follow-up, 69.6 months), 10/24 patients experienced progressive disease.

In this study, we analyzed changes in the incidence of cases of amebiasis, giardiasis, and other gastrointestinal protozoal infections before (2017-2019) and during (2020-2022) the pandemic. Our findings indicate a decrease in the incidence of these infections, with no significant variations in incidence by gender or age, and a higher incidence during months with elevated temperature and humidity. Sociodemographic factors, including residence in homes with earthen floors, poverty, limited access to healthcare services, inadequate nutrition, unemployment, and overcrowded living conditions, were associated with an increased risk of infection. Additionally, our results highlight the impact of public health policies on disease control, demonstrating that COVID-19 containment measures - such as international travel restrictions, workplace closures, event cancellations, stay-at-home mandates, and enhanced hand hygiene - also contributed to reducing parasitic infections. The persistent prevalence of protozoal infections in both periods underscores the urgent need to improve sanitation, personal hygiene, and public health education, particularly in developing countries, to mitigate their high burden.

Dans cette étude, nous avons analysé l’évolution de l’incidence des cas d’amibiase, de giardiase et d’autres infections gastro-intestinales à protozoaires avant (2017-2019) et pendant (2020-2022) la pandémie. Nos résultats indiquent une diminution de l’incidence de ces infections, sans variations significatives selon le sexe ou l’âge, et une incidence plus élevée pendant les mois où la température et l’humidité sont élevées. Des facteurs sociodémographiques, notamment le fait de vivre dans un logement au sol en terre battue, la pauvreté, un accès limité aux services de santé, une alimentation inadéquate, le chômage et le surpeuplement, étaient associés à un risque accru d’infection. De plus, nos résultats soulignent l’impact des politiques de santé publique sur la lutte contre la maladie, démontrant que les mesures de confinement liées à la COVID-19 – telles que les restrictions de voyages internationaux, la fermeture des lieux de travail, l’annulation d’événements, le confinement et le renforcement de l’hygiène des mains – ont également contribué à réduire les infections parasitaires. La prévalence persistante des infections à protozoaires au cours des deux périodes souligne l’urgence d’améliorer l’assainissement, l’hygiène personnelle et l’éducation en santé publique, en particulier dans les pays en développement, afin d’atténuer leur lourd fardeau.",

We evaluated the frequency and density of Spn in nasopharyngeal samples, frequency of multiple respiratory virus detection, mucosal cytokine/chemokine levels, and mucosal antibody levels to Spn proteins and capsular polysaccharides during SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in children. This retrospective study evaluated 222 nasopharyngeal samples collected from children (age 0-18 years) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between May 2020 and October 2021. In 111 SARS-CoV-2 positive (+) and 111 SARS-CoV-2 negative (-) samples, we tested for Spn presence and density, 6 viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, enterovirus and adenoviruses), 9 mucosal cytokine and chemokine levels, mucosal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody levels to Spn PhtD and PcpA proteins and 7 capsular polysaccharides. Fourteen percent had Spn concurrently present in SARS-CoV-2+ versus 10.6% for SARS-CoV-2-, (not significant). Concurrent SARS-CoV-2 and human rhinovirus detection occurred. Nasopharyngeal cytokine levels in SARS-CoV-2+ samples were not different compared to SARS-CoV-2- samples, except for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (higher in SARS-CoV-2+), and not impacted by presence/density of Spn. Nasopharyngeal IgG antibody levels to PhtD and PcpA, and capsular polysaccharide serotypes during SARS-CoV-2+ infections were not different compared to SARS-CoV-2-. Nasopharyngeal Spn detection and density were not different between SARS-CoV-2+ and SARS-CoV-2- samples in children. Concurrent respiratory virus infection was not common. Nasopharyngeal monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was higher in SARS-CoV-2+ children. Nasopharyngeal IgG antibody levels to 2 Spn proteins and 7 polysaccharide capsule types did not differ between SARS-CoV-2+ and SARS-CoV-2- samples.",

    "title": "Impact of Canada's Cannabis Act on drug- and alcohol-related collisions in Québec: an interrupted time-series analysis of five major cities.",
    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of non-medical cannabis laws (NMCLs) on road safety outcomes, specifically focusing on drug- and alcohol-related traffic crashes. Using cannabis sales data as a proxy for consumption trends, the study aims to assess how changes in cannabis availability may influence road safety outcomes, particularly exploring the potential for drugs and alcohol to have distinct yet related influences on impaired driving. An interrupted time-series design was used to assess the impact of NMCLs on daily drug- and alcohol-related traffic crashes, including fatalities and severe injuries (KSI). The analysis covered five cities in the province of Québec-Montréal, Québec, Laval, Longueuil, and Sherbrooke-using data from January 1, 2015; to December 31, 2022. The dependent variables included KSI, drug-related crashes, and alcohol-related crashes, while the independent variables were daily cannabis legal sales (kg) and total legal and estimated illegal cannabis sales. Control variables accounted for temperature, time trends, and the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions' index for the province of Québec (QCnPI-Index). To estimate effects, we applied Generalized Linear Models using Negative binomial regression, followed by a random-effects meta-analysis to assess overall effects across cities. Higher total cannabis sales were significantly associated with a 12% increase in drug-related crashes (IRR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.27) and a 12% rise in alcohol-related crashes (IRR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.06-1.18) across all cities combined. In Montréal, cannabis sales were linked to an 87% increase in drug-related crashes (IRR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.54-2.28) and a 93% increase in alcohol-related crashes (IRR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.58-2.36). In Longueuil, drug-related crashes rose by 76% (IRR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.02-3.02) and alcohol-related crashes by 43% (IRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.08-1.92). Québec City only showed a 44% increase in alcohol-related crashes (IRR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.28-1.64). No significant associations were found in Laval or Sherbrooke. The findings suggest that increased cannabis availability, as measured by cannabis sales, is associated with higher rates of both drug- and alcohol-related crashes, particularly in Montréal and Longueuil. These results support the hypothesis that changes in cannabis availability may influence two distinct impaired driving patterns, highlighting the need for region-specific road safety interventions.",

    "title": "Temporal dynamics between COVID-19 cases and particulate matter in Bangkok: Impact of lockdown policies on air quality and disease transmission.",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and ambient air pollution in Bangkok, Thailand, during multiple pandemic waves from January 2020 to January 2022. The objectives were to quantify correlations between COVID-19 cases and criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3) across pandemic phases, analyze relationship variations during different waves and control periods, delineate temporal and seasonal trends, and evaluate lockdown effects on disease transmission and air quality. We employed comprehensive time-series analysis using data from six air quality monitoring stations and daily COVID-19 case records. Air quality parameters were measured using reference-grade instrumentation including Beta-attenuation monitors for particulate matter, non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy for CO, chemiluminescence for NO2, and ultraviolet photometry for O3. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation with Bonferroni correction, multiple linear regression with assumption verification, and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) forecasting, stratified by seasonal variations, lockdown periods, and viral variant periods. During the first lockdown (March-June 2020), moderate positive correlations existed between COVID-19 cases and particulate matter (PM2.5: r = 0.159; PM10: r = 0.093), with both infection rates and pollution levels decreasing significantly (PM2.5 declined 18.7%). During Delta variant prevalence (July-August 2021), correlations shifted negative (PM2.5: r = -0.073; PM10: r = -0.125), indicating variant dynamics superseded environmental influences. Multiple regression revealed nitrogen dioxide from vehicular sources as the primary PM2.5 predictor (β = 0.682, p < 0.001), explaining 72.4% of variation. Seasonal analysis showed particulate pollution peaked during winter months, with average PM2.5 levels (36.54 ± 18.73 μg/m3) exceeding WHO guidelines. This research demonstrates that Bangkok's air quality improvements during COVID-19 restrictions resulted primarily from reduced vehicular emissions rather than industrial changes, suggesting targeted traffic emission reduction strategies could substantially improve air quality while highlighting complex environmental-disease transmission relationships during pandemics.Implication StatementThis study examines the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 transmission in Bangkok, Thailand, providing important findings for air quality management in large cities. The research shows that lockdown measures significantly reduced air pollution levels, with the largest decrease in nitrogen dioxide (42.3%) and carbon monoxide (27.8%), both primarily from vehicle emissions.The findings indicate that traffic is the main source of particulate matter pollution in Bangkok. Nitrogen dioxide levels were the strongest predictor of PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting that controlling vehicle emissions would be an effective approach to reduce overall air pollution. During the study period, PM₂.₅ levels exceeded World Health Organization guidelines on 95.8% of days in winter, demonstrating the severity of the pollution problem.The seasonal patterns observed in this study highlight the need for different pollution control strategies throughout the year. Winter months showed the highest pollution levels, while the rainy season had the lowest concentrations due to natural cleaning processes. This information can help authorities plan targeted interventions during high-risk periods.For air quality managers and public health officials, these results support the implementation of policies that reduce vehicle emissions, such as promoting public transportation and electric vehicles. The study also demonstrates the value of integrating air quality monitoring with health surveillance systems to better understand pollution impacts on public health.The research methodology and findings can be applied to other tropical cities facing similar challenges with air pollution and public health management. The results provide evidence that environmental policies can have immediate benefits for both air quality and public health outcomes.",

[0pc][-1pc]Please check and confirm the corresponding authors have been correctly identified amend if necessary.Yet, epidemiological outcomes may diverge when assuming polarised immunity-individuals are either fully susceptible or completely immune-compared to leaky immunity-where all individuals are partially protected. We explore the differences between the two by taking advantage of a non-Markovian framework, which allows us to explicitly record the 'age' of the immunity and vary its effectiveness accordingly. A basic scenario reveals that leaky immunity leads to a shorter time between reinfections. A more data-driven scenario based on SARS-CoV-2 data finds that leaky immunity yields substantially more reinfections than polarised immunity and a higher number of infected individuals, yet with a lower probability of hospitalisation. Our findings emphasize the critical role of immune memory modelling assumptions, especially for long-term epidemiological dynamics and public health policies.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant global mortality. Obesity is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. This study examined the relationship between BMI, clinical interventions, and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using pre-vaccine national data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified electronic health records from the HCA Healthcare database, comprising 149 hospitals across 18 U.S. states. Adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2022, were included. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice, analyzed by BMI category. Secondary outcomes included inpatient mortality, need for mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) length of stay. Out of 38,321 hospital encounters, 21,996 met the inclusion criteria. Unadjusted analyses showed no significant differences in rates of all-cause mortality or hospice discharge across BMI categories. However, obese patients had higher rates of mechanical ventilation (7.8% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.001), tracheostomy placement (1.2% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean 11.5 ± 15.1 vs. 6.8 ± 8.7 days, p < 0.001), and longer ICU stays (8.3 ± 10.4 vs. 5.1 ± 6.4 days, p < 0.001) than normal BMI patients. In adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and comorbidities, obesity was independently associated with increased odds of all-cause mortality or hospice discharge (OR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.55, p < 0.05), inpatient mortality (OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.34-2.08, p < 0.001), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.31-1.82, p < 0.001), and tracheostomy placement (OR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03-2.41, p < 0.05). Obesity was a significant predictor of longer duration of mechanical ventilation (β = 3.67 days, 95% CI: 1.28-6.06, p < 0.001) and ICU stay (β = 2.90 days, 95% CI: 2.08-3.72, p < 0.001). Obesity was independently associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings highlight the importance of BMI as a prognostic factor in acute COVID-19 management.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seropositivity is associated with chronic immune dysregulation conditions, including multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, post-COVID-19 condition, and multiple cancers. Sepsis is an acute immune dysregulation condition attributed to 1 of 5 global deaths. To assess causal associations among EBV seropositivity, immune dysregulation, and mortality in children with sepsis. This cohort study analyzed 320 children with sepsis in the 9-center Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network Phenotyping Pediatric Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ Failure (PHENOMS) study who had not previously received intravenous immune globulin. Blood samples and clinical data were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, and assayed from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022. Causal algorithms were modeled in directed acyclic graphs and subsequent sensitivity and mediation analyses applied with further confirmation by structural equation modeling. Data analysis was performed from May 2022 to January 2025. Blood sample collected at 24 to 48 hours of sepsis. Circulating biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and 32 cytokines), immune depression (ex vivo tumor necrosis factor response to endotoxin < 200 pg/mL), thrombotic microangiopathy (ADAMTS13 activity <57%), and EBV seropositivity (viral capsid IgG) were measured. Causal inference analysis identified causal associations between EBV seropositivity, immune dysregulation biomarkers, macrophage activation syndrome, and death. Of the 320 children (median [IQR] age, 6 [1-12] years; 172 [53.8%] male), 150 (46.9%) were previously healthy, and 72 (22.5%) had immunocompromise at admission. A total of 172 (53.8%) had causal associations with death directly and through the mediators hyperferritinemia and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and also had direct causal associations with increased C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin 18 binding protein, which in turn had direct causal associations with decreased ADAMTS 13 activity and decreased whole blood ex vivo tumor necrosis factor response to endotoxin. Mediation analysis found that EBV seropositivity was associated with mortality (estimate [SE], 1.86 [0.55]; P < .001). With both EBV seropositivity and ferritin included in the model, the effect of EBV seropositivity on death remained (estimate [SE], 1.52 [0.57]; P = .007), as did the ferritin effect (estimate [SE], 0.50 [0.15]; P = .001). EBV seropositivity remained significantly associated with death even after adjustment for MAS (estimate [SE], 1.78 [0.56]; P = .001). In this cohort study of pediatric sepsis, EBV seropositivity was associated with immune dysregulation and mortality. Further study is warranted to address the possibility that latent EBV infection immune reprogramming poses an important public health problem that contributes to not only chronic disorders of immune dysregulation but also acute disorders of immune dysregulation, such as sepsis.",

    "abstract": "An increase in pediatric cases of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease was noted in the Netherlands starting in early 2022. GAS disease can range from mild to life-threatening invasive infections. Clinical and public health decisions rely on timely and detailed reporting of clinical data. To determine risk factors associated with severe pediatric iGAS, defined as requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or death, and to analyze pediatric iGAS incidence, presentations, and outcome between pre-COVID-19 pandemic (January 2015 to March 2020), COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 to December 2021), and post-COVID-19 pandemic (January 2022 to June 2024) periods. This observational, retrospective and prospective cohort study in 20 hospitals (tertiary and nontertiary) in the Netherlands was conducted from January 2015 to June 2024, with real-time reporting of data on the study website since January 2022. Children aged 0 to 17 years with iGAS (positive culture or polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical presentation) were included. iGAS infection. The primary outcome was risk factors for severe iGAS; secondary outcomes included iGAS incidence rate and clinical phenotypes prior, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk factors for severity and mortality were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) between pre-COVID-19 and postCOVID-19 pandemic periods were calculated using Poisson regression. Of 617 children included, 351 (56.9%) were aged 0 to 4 years. For the 192 participants with detailed data collection, median (IQR) age was 4.2 (1.7-7.1) years and 91 (47.4%) were male. iGAS cases decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased significantly in the post-COVID-19 period (IRR, 2.93; 95%, 2.46-3.49), as compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. By late 2023, the incidence of iGAS returned to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Factors associated with increased risk of severe disease included a post-COVID-19 pandemic diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 3.49; 95% CI, 2.31-6.26), pulmonary involvement (OR, 8.64; 95% CI, 5.50-13.55), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS; OR, 11.71; 95% CI, 4.39-31.18), and meningitis or encephalitis (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 4.39-31.18). Clinical factors associated with increased risk of severe disease were reduced consciousness (OR, 7.61; 95% CI, 1.84-34.41), dyspnea (OR, 9.89; 95% CI, 3.04-32.14), abnormal auscultation (OR, 6.32; 95% CI, 2.18-18.32), and elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.32; 95% CI, 2.18-18.32), while estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with a decreased risk (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.84). Disease severity increased in post-COVID-19-pandemic cases, with higher mortality (13 of 294 cases [4.4%] vs 3 of 218 cases [1.4%]) and intensive care admission rates (113 of 294 cases [38.4%] vs 34 of 218 cases [15.6%]), as compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic cases. Severity of pulmonary iGAS was similar in both periods. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, there was a significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary infections (IRR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.27-7.97) , STSS (IRR, 10.30; 95% CI, 3.88-35.60), meningitis or encephalitis (IRR, 12.30; 95% CI, 4.14-52.70), and necrotizing fasciitis (IRR, 26.10; 95% CI, 5.14-475.00). In this cohort study, risk factors for a complicated course of iGAS in children included pulmonary or central nervous system involvement, STSS, reduced consciousness or pulmonary clinical signs, elevated CRP, and decreased eGFR. Awareness of these risk factors is important to improve timely recognition of at-risk cases and improve clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In Central Denmark Region, early management of COVID-19 patients was delegated to emergency departments. This study aims to evaluate the mortality of patients admitted with pulmonary embolism, before and during the pandemic, as symptoms could mimic COVID-19. In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with the action diagnosis of pulmonary embolism admitted to emergency departments in Central Denmark Region between March 1, 2019, and February 28, 2021. The inclusion period defined two equivalent periods before (pre-COVID) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID). The COVID period was used as exposure. 30-day mortality was the primary outcome, while 7-day mortality and transfer to intensive care units were two of the secondary outcomes. A total of 328 and 300 patients with pulmonary embolism were admitted to an emergency department in Central Denmark Region pre and during COVID, respectively. There were no significant associations between admission during COVID and death within 30 days from admission date compared to pre-COVID patients (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 0.88-3.05). Comparing COVID to pre-COVID there were no significant differences in severity upon arrival to hospital (simplified pulmonary Embolism Severity Index 0 or ≥ 1 point(s), p = 0.759) or number of patients transferred to intensive care unit (6 vs. 9, p = 0.340). We found no differences in mortality or in transfer to ICU for patients with pulmonary embolism admitted in Central Denmark Region before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study addressed hospital resource management adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how cases with emergency admission diagnosis of pulmonary embolism fared during the pandemic period compared to other periods outside of the pandemic. For this Danish cohort analysis, pandemic conditions were not associated with different outcomes or ICU access compared to comparison periods.",

A systematic literature search was performed across four databases for studies published between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2025. The inclusion criteria focused on studies evaluating sperm DNA fragmentation in healthy men infected with the virus. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model based on the tests employed in the studies to measure SDF. Data were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Out of 105 identified citations, seven articles were included in this analysis. The NOS results indicated that all studies were of high quality. Subgroup analysis revealed that all testing methods, including TUNEL, flow cytometry, and the sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test, demonstrated high heterogeneity, with the lowest heterogeneity found in the TUNEL test. The pooled analysis indicated a statistically significant increase in SDF (random effects model, WMD = 12.558, 95% CI: 4.482 to 20.635, I2 = 99%, Z = 3.05, p < 0.0001). This meta-analysis suggests a statistically significant reduction in sperm DNA integrity 2-3 months following COVID-19 infection. However, caution is warranted when interpreting these results due to the high heterogeneity, which may affect the outcomes. A thorough analysis considering participant characteristics and infection status is recommended.",

We evaluate whether easily accessible biomarkers can improve risk prediction of severe disease outcomes. Our study analysed 426 COVID-19 patients collected by German CAPNETZ and PROGRESS study groups between 2020 and 2021. Troponin T high-sensitive (TnT-hs), procalcitonin (PCT), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, angiopoietin-2, copeptin, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and lipocalin-2 were measured at enrolment and related to 28d mortality/ICU admission endpoint. Logistic and relaxed LASSO regression were used to evaluate the added value of biomarkers compared to the CRB-65 score and to develop a combined risk prediction model for our endpoint. Of the 426 COVID-19 patients, 64 (15%) reached the endpoint. Among individual biomarkers, ET-1 showed the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70-0.82). CRB-65 alone had an AUC of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.56-0.70). Our machine learning method identified CRB-65 + ET-1 to be optimal for prediction performance and model sparsity (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71-0.83). Decision curve analysis demonstrated its greater net benefit over CRB-65 across large range of risk thresholds. The generalizability of our non-COVID CAP model (CRB-65 + TnT-hs + PCT) to COVID-19 patients was also assessed, yielding an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.60-0.74) for our primary endpoint. For 28d mortality alone as endpoint, it performed remarkably well (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.95). Combining the already established clinical CRB-65 score with ET-1 significantly improves risk prediction of intensive care requirement or death within 28 days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

Despite global guidance to initiate WS programming in Asia, the priorities and needs in Asia remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment of WS efforts in Asia. An institutional survey recorded 89 separate projects among 45 institutions in 19 countries in Asia. Financing for WS was equally split between domestic and external resources. Most projects were research-oriented, with one-fifth embedded within national surveillance systems. Influents from urban wastewater treatment plants were the most common sampling sources identified, with either monthly or weekly sampling frequencies. Most efforts were single-pathogen focused, with SARS-CoV-2, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) bacteria, enterovirus, influenza and poliovirus being the top five pathogens assessed. Despite challenges including limited funding and government support, there has been substantial recent progress on the adoption of WS across Asia. Opportunities to enhance sustainability and scale will depend upon efforts to document public health use cases, support national planning and budgeting, develop tailored protocols and regional guidance, and advance innovative multi-pathogen approaches that leverage innovations including pathogen genomics to advance cost-efficient WS systems for public health impact.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) following cerebral ischemia is one of the brain's early responses to counteract neuron loss and minimize tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through various chemotactic signals that promote cell migration and differentiation, primarily involving neural stem cells, neuroblasts, or glioblasts. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newly formed astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario remain subjects of debate. We have previously demonstrated that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we used transient brain ischemia in mice to identify the cellular origin of these astrocytes within the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing, and genetic cell labeling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the perilesional barrier surrounding the ischemic core, known as the 'glial scar'. We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the lesion border by both synthesizing and degrading hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of hyaluronan at the lesion site is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These findings suggest that newborn astrocytes could be a promising pharmacological target for modulating the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitating tissue regeneration.",

    "title": "Occupational Participation and Physical Activity Among Adults Who Recovered From COVID-19 and Those Who Did Not.",
    "abstract": "Although substantial evidence exists regarding persistent symptoms and functional impairment in hospital settings following COVID-19, there is a noticeable lack of data on occupational participation and physical activity in community-based settings. To compare the levels of occupational participation and physical activity among adults who had recovered from acute COVID-19 infection and those who had not recovered. Retrospective comparative cohort descriptive study. Fifty English-speaking adults age 18 yr or older who tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 4 yr but not within the past 6 mo were enrolled, including participants who had not recovered and those who had fully recovered. Measures included the Occupational Self-Assessment-Short Form and Modifiable Activity Questionnaire. Chi-square tests and independent-samples t tests were used for data analysis. Individuals who did not fully recover from COVID-19 displayed significant differences in age (p = .002), marital status (p = .026), body mass index (p = .003), and disability income (p = .034) compared with those who recovered. They also reported lower competence (p = .049) in occupational participation and spent less time (p < .001) and effort (p < .001) on occupational activities. The results confirm the Model of Human Occupation theory that physical limitations can impede a person's daily activities and restrict their participation in more strenuous tasks. Nonetheless, this does not diminish the value of occupational participation, even if they are presently engaged in lighter indoor leisure activities. Plain-Language Summary: The Model of Human Occupation theory highlights that occupational participation-how individuals engage in work, play, and daily activities within their social and cultural environments-is vital for well-being. After COVID-19, many people continue to face lingering symptoms, yet understanding of its effects on occupational participation and physical activity in community settings is limited. This study compared occupational participation and physical activity levels between adults fully recovered from acute COVID-19 and those still recovering. The results showed clear differences, with those not fully recovered feeling less competent in managing daily tasks and participating less in physically or mentally demanding activities. These findings suggest that rehabilitation programs should focus not only on improving physical abilities but also on addressing the psychological factors involved in returning to daily life.",

    "title": "Mucosal vaccination with long-form TSLP induces migratory cDC1-mediated adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
    "abstract": "A combination of vaccination strategies will potentially be required for effective control of the virus pandemic. We report that mice intranasally immunized with commercial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccines enriched with the human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) variant, long-form TSLP (lfTSLP), but not the short-isoform TSLP (sfTSLP), induced robust antigen-specific systemic and mucosal antibody production. The adjuvant-enhancing activity of lfTSLP in mice requires functional TSLP receptor signals in migratory type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Furthermore, lfTSLP acts on migratory cDC1s to enhance T follicular helper (Tfh) cell and germinal center (GC) B cell responses. Intranasal vaccination with lfTSLP elicits long-lasting immunogenicity and protection against the challenge of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.617.2 variant in mice. Our study provides insights into the adjuvant role of lfTSLP, which is critical in enhancing migratory cDC1-mediated GC responses to improve vaccine efficacy. Adjuvants are indispensable components of subunit vaccines, and the development of adjuvants capable of inducing powerful systemic and mucosal immune responses is critical for enhancing the efficacy of viral vaccines. This study reveals that the human long-form thymic stromal lymphopoietin (lfTSLP) induces antigen-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibody production with sustained immunogenicity. Mechanistically, lfTSLP enhances germinal center reactions by preferentially activating migratory type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the adjuvant activity of lfTSLP, which enhances vaccine-induced adaptive immunity and confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings indicate that the application of lfTSLP as an adjuvant should be encouraged in the rational design and development of viral vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Bats are the reservoir hosts of emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) affecting human and livestock health. We assessed the diversity, evolution, and geographic distribution of two alphacoronaviruses (subgenus Rhinacovirus) with considerable potential for emergence: swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which has caused large outbreaks in pigs in China and can infect primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro; and the related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (HKU2-CoV). Phylogenetic analyses of 523 rhinacovirus sequences from bats in China and Southeast Asia suggest these viruses should be reclassified into at least two distinct CoV species representing two well-supported monophyletic clades. Stronger phylogenetic clustering by sampling location than by host species suggests infrequent long-distance transmission of rhinacoviruses in southern China. Ancestral state reconstruction analysis indicates that R. sinicus/thomasi and R. affinis have played an important role in rhinacovirus evolution in southern China and that R. affinis is the likely reservoir host of SADS-CoV that spilled over into pigs. We used species distribution modeling of Rhinolophus spp. bat hosts of rhinacoviruses, combined with pig and human density data, to identify potential geographic rhinacovirus spillover risk in Southeast Asia. Areas of high pig density within suitable bat habitat exist primarily in southern China and northern Vietnam, and hotspots of the highest human density within suitable bat habitat are primarily along the southern coast of China, Java, and central Thailand. Targeted surveillance of pigs and people in these regions may facilitate the timely detection of bat CoV spillover events and mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.IMPORTANCEBats are the reservoir or ancestral hosts of important emerging coronaviruses affecting people (e.g., SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and livestock (e.g., PEDV, SADS-CoV). Here, we analyzed 523 genetic sequences of SADS-CoV that caused large-scale die-offs of pigs in China, which is known to be able to infect human cells and related HKU2-CoVs. We used this information to identify the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis as the likely spillover host for the outbreak in pigs, and identified the bat species within which these viruses evolved. We then modeled the distribution of these host species and their overlap with dense human and pig populations to identify the regions where surveillance programs can help identify spillover events and prevent future outbreaks.",

Using a prospective healthcare personnel cohort in two hospitals in Lima, Peru (July 2022-June 2023), we compared and evaluated the performance of three symptom profiles of three common surveillance case definitions to identify influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections: influenza-like illness, coronavirus disease 2019-like illness (CLI), and acute respiratory infection. Participants with an acute respiratory illness reported symptom progression twice weekly. Participants self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction testing. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each case definition were evaluated. Of 1623 participants enrolled, 1450 illness episodes were reported; 92 (6%) were positive for influenza, 350 (24%) for SARS-CoV-2, and 3 (0.2%) were positive for both. For the four influenza-like illness case definitions evaluated, all yielded low sensitivity for detection of influenza (points estimate range, 23%-35%) and SARS-COV-2 (range, 21%-29%), but high specificity (83%-90% and 86%-92%, respectively). In contrast, the acute respiratory infection and coronavirus disease 2019-like illness definitions both yielded high sensitivity (83%-100%) and low specificity (2%-41%) for detection of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2. The performance of case definitions was similar for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 supporting the use of the same definitions by surveillance networks. The substantial differences in sensitivity and specificity across the case definitions necessitate surveillance objectives and cost considerations in selecting a case definition fit for purpose.",

Inclusion criteria: Population: patients (≥18 years) with PCS; Intervention: PR; Comparison: control group (CG) vs. placebo; Outcome: fatigue assessed before and after the intervention; Study: randomized clinical trials. Methodological quality was assessed with Downs and Black scale and risk of bias with Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.4. Thirteen studies were included in the systematic review and 10 in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a moderate effect size (SMD = -0.59, 95% CI = -0.89, -0.28; p = 0.0002, n = 973) in favor of PR compared to CG for fatigue, with significant differences. Compared to CG, fatigue in patients with PCS was reduced to a greater extent in PR group (both center-based PR and home-based PR, and both <12 weeks of PR and ≥12 weeks of PR), with significant differences. This review demonstrates the efficacy of PR as a promising intervention for alleviating fatigue in patients with PCS, revealing a significantly greater reduction in fatigue in PR group compared to CG.

    "abstract": "With continued high disease burden in vulnerable groups and fiscal responsibility shifting to Canada's jurisdictions, assessing the economic value of COVID-19 vaccines is critical for optimizing COVID-19 prevention. This study estimated the public health impact and economically justifiable price (EJP) of Moderna's next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283) versus no vaccination in Canada, and relative to currently authorized vaccines (mRNA-1273; BNT-162b2). The target population included individuals aged ≥65 years and 12-64 years at high-risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, consistent with 2025/2026 national guidelines. Analyses were conducted using a static decision-analytic model (1-year horizon) from a publicly funded healthcare payer perspective. Vaccine efficacy against infection and hospitalization for mRNA-1283 versus no 2024/2025 vaccination was based on mRNA-1283's pivotal trial and mRNA-1273 real-world data. Clinical outcomes included infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and number needed to vaccinate (NNV); economic outcomes included total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and EJP at a $50,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared to no vaccine, annual vaccination with mRNA-1283 prevented 288,912 symptomatic infections (NNV = 15), 11,710 hospitalizations (NNV = 364), and 2,194 deaths (NNV = 1,944). The EJP for mRNA-1283 was $325 ($230-$771 in sensitivity analyses). Semi-annual dosing (≥65 or ≥80 years) averted additional hospitalizations and deaths compared to annual vaccination. mRNA-1283 prevented an additional 2,873-3,689 hospitalizations and 537-690 deaths compared to currently authorized vaccines. EJPs for mRNA-1283 were $78 and $103 when compared to mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, respectively. This study does not include indirect effects, and mRNA-1283 effectiveness has not yet been validated in real-world studies. VE waning and incidence estimates are highly uncertain. British and American estimates were used as Canadian data proxies. mRNA-1283 could reduce the COVID-19 clinical burden and provide economic value for the NACI-recommended population, exceeding current mRNA vaccines; COVID-19 program planners may consider supporting access to mRNA-1283 to optimize public health impact.",

The optimal way to incorporate telehealth into existing care models is unknown. The goal of this study was to understand patient and caregiver experience with telehealth in a large pediatric pulmonary clinic following the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized there would be continued favorable perceptions given its convenience, though concerns around limited in-person assessments may persist. This was a cross-sectional survey study of patients and caregivers who attended a telehealth visit in our pediatric pulmonary clinic in 2023. Of 992 eligible participants, 185 completed the survey (19% response rate). Seventy-one percent reported their telehealth visit was more convenient than in-person care and 95% felt telehealth was an acceptable alternative. Considering lack of in-person assessments, including physical exam, vital signs, lung function testing, lab studies and imaging, 75% were not concerned, 21% felt somewhat concerned, and 4% felt very concerned. There was no difference in rates of concern by patient's age, visit diagnosis or reason for visit. Considering future use, 94% of respondents reported they would use telehealth again in the future. Attendees of a telehealth visit at a single center pediatric pulmonary clinic report favorable experiences citing convenience, similar acceptability relative to in-person care and a desire for continued access in the future. Concerns remain around limited in-person assessments and further work is needed to understand for whom and in what capacity telehealth leads to optimal outcomes.",

The bitter taste receptor T2R38, expressed in nasal and sinus mucosa, supports innate immunity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt; gene affect individuals' ability to perceive its agonist - phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) - as bitter. Carriers of non-functional variants often experience more severe CRS.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the accuracy of the PTC taste strip test in determining the T2R38 phenotype and its correlation with genotype confirmed by molecular analysis. We also assessed associations between T2R38 polymorphisms, surgical outcomes, and COVID-19 incidence.&lt;b&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 50 patients with CRS and 37 controls underwent a PTC taste strip test and completed a clinical questionnaire. &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt; genotyping was performed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood and mucosal samples.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The functional PAV variant strongly correlated with the ability to perceive PTC as bitter. Identified genotypes included &lt;i&gt;PAV/PAV, PAV/AVI, AVI/AVI&lt;/i&gt;, and rarer forms (&lt;i&gt;AAV/AVI, PAV/AAV&lt;/i&gt;). The &lt;i&gt;AVI/AVI&lt;/i&gt; genotype was associated with more severe CRS on CT scans. No significant association was found between genotype and surgical outcomes or COVID-19 incidence.&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; Phenotypic taste testing may help identify individuals with impaired T2R38 function and poorer innate immune responses, allowing for more tailored treatment.&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The PTC taste strip test is a simple, non-invasive tool that correlates well with &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt; genotype and may support clinical decision-making in CRS.",

    "abstract": "Viral exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes in offspring. Given the increasing frequency of viral outbreaks both locally and globally, the current study sought to examine the impact of antenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) and SARS-CoV-2 on infant neurophysiological development during the first year of life. Families were recruited from two cohorts, one in San Juan, Puerto Rico (ZIKV) and one in Boston, Massachusetts (SARS-CoV-2). For the ZIKV cohort, infants were assessed cross-sectionally between 3 to 12 months of age. For SARS-CoV-2, infants were assessed longitudinally at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to compare absolute power during a resting state task across the whole brain (by spectral band) between infants with antenatal viral exposure and nonexposed infants. Data were analysed using generalized linear models (GLMs) and multilevel mixed effects models. In the ZIKV cohort, age-by-exposure interactions were observed for delta (p = 0.027) and theta power (p = 0.009), where exposed infants demonstrated decreasing power with age, while nonexposed infants demonstrated increasing power with age from 3 to 12 months. In the SARS-CoV-2 cohort, antenatally exposed children had lower levels of beta (p = 0.022) and gamma power (p = 0.044) overall from 3 to 12 months. Significant recovery was observed in trajectories for beta power by 12 months. ZIKV exposure during pregnancy was associated with reductions in low-frequency EEG power, which may be indicative of disruptions in early brain maturation. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with reductions in higher-frequency power, suggesting potential impairments on sensorimotor and cognitive integration. Increases in beta power by 12 months in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort indicate some recovery, although potential compounding and sleeper effects from early disruptions are possible.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in late 2019 as the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has triggered a global public health crisis. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is one of the key host factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and invasion. The inhibitors against TMPRSS2 emerge as a promising therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 and other potential viral infections. However, the precise mechanism of action for TMPRSS2 inhibitors remains unclear, with studies on structural optimization being notably scarce. In this work, multiple molecular simulation strategies were employed to systematically compare binding details and conformational changes of the representative inhibitors (i.e., camostat and nafamostat) with those of TMPRSS2 at the atomic level, thereby proposing potential inhibitory mechanisms underlying their activity differences. Compared with camostat, nafamostat is more likely to form a stable covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. Next, a series of derivatives were designed with the same core structure (i.e., 4-guanidino benzoyl). And finally, the novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor with potentially better performance was identified based on the principle of the lowest binding free energy. This work not only elucidates the inhibitory mechanisms of camostat and nafamostat, showing valuable theoretical insights, but also proposes a viable strategy for future molecular design, thereby exhibiting promising application prospects.",

We analyzed data from 96,694 COVID-19 patients collected by the Korean National Center for Disaster and Trauma. Using classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest models, we predicted suicidality based on 39 features, including demographic information, COVID-19-related factors, and psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, somatic, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Based on the final model with the highest performance index, we presented the results with a scorecard that includes multiple cut-off scores.

Ensuring comprehensive healthcare in disaster-stricken areas is critical, as conventional medical resources may be insufficient in some settings. Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine (JTM) offers a potential solution for enhancing healthcare delivery in these scenarios. This work was motivated by the desire to facilitate the international dissemination of the integration of Western medicine and traditional medicine. Japan has integrated JTM, including herbal medicine, acupuncture, and massage therapy, with conventional medical care in disaster and pandemic responses. JTM has been applied in disaster settings to help manage a wide range of conditions, including respiratory infections, hypothermia, gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and musculoskeletal pain. Japan's unique medical system, where physicians are trained in both Western and JTM, allows for their seamless integration in healthcare and disaster relief efforts. Furthermore, herbal medicines are covered by the National Health Insurance System. More recently, JTM has also been integrated with conventional treatments during infectious disease outbreaks. Early administration appeared beneficial in preventing disease progression and in alleviating symptoms, particularly among individuals without prior immunization. The successful integration of JTM in disaster and pandemic management highlights its role as a complementary healthcare approach. Japan's model demonstrates the potential benefits of combining traditional and Western medicine and provides valuable insights for other countries seeking to enhance disaster preparedness and healthcare resilience.",

Data are collected during the peak surge period (December 2022-January 2023) using a web crawling program and field research to extract patient volume statistics, patient spatial distribution, and spatial adaptive measures from the text and image clusters.ResultsDuring the surge, the EDs had to accommodate patients with peak volume 2 to 3 times higher than normal patient volume, resulting in ED overcrowding and public space occupation including hallways and corridors. Spatial adaptive measures, including existing space requisition, existing patient flow improvement, and the construction of the \"Second ED\" were adopted to maintain ED's normal operation.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 surge overwhelmed EDs in Shanghai, prompting the implementation of relevant spatial adaptive measures.

The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the guidance for conducting COVID-19 intra-action reviews (IARs) in July 2020. As of November 25, 2022, 136 IARs have been conducted by 78 countries in all 6 WHO regions. IARs are country-led and outcomes country-owned, with the flexible methodology enabling countries to focus on COVID-19-related priority issues in their national and subnational contexts. WHO's approach to promoting the use of IARs recognizes the importance of 3 learning modalities: countries learning through self-reflection, countries learning from each other, and WHO and partners learning from countries to improve WHO guidance and tools. Moving forward, the value of reflective learning in public health emergencies can be further enhanced by institutionalizing an ongoing learning mindset and translating reflective learning-based recommendations into policy change and action.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID may limit people's ability to carry out daily activities, including work. Little is known about the potential effect of long COVID on work limitations and absenteeism. We describe employment status and characteristics, work limitations, cognitive dysfunction, and sickness absenteeism among adults with and without long COVID. Using data from the cross-sectional 2022 National Health Interview Survey, we estimated the prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of work-related outcomes by long COVID status among US adults ≥ 18 years (n = 26,270). Among employed adults with prior COVID-19 illness, we estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios for work limitations (compared to no limitations), cognitive dysfunction (some or a lot of difficulty with memory or concentration compared to no difficulty), and sickness absenteeism ( ≥ 11 sick days compared to 0-10 days) in the prior year. All estimates account for survey design and are weighted to the US noninstitutionalized population. Analyses were conducted in 2024. 3.4% of adults reported long COVID. Adults with long COVID more often reported being unable to work due to health or disability compared to adults without long COVID (p = 0.0006). Among employed adults with prior COVID-19 illness, long COVID was associated with higher odds of work limitations (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), cognitive dysfunction (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), and sickness absenteeism (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) compared to those who did not develop long COVID. Long COVID was associated with work limitations, cognitive dysfunction, and sickness absenteeism among employed US adults. Workplace accommodations may be important considerations for people with long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Background Blended learning (BL) for skill acquisition is an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum. Teachers may be trained in BL using physical or virtual platforms. Training of Trainers (ToT) using a virtual platform was adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic. We report our experience in conducting virtual training to impart hands-on knowledge to trainers about the BL technique. Methods We conducted a virtual ToT workshop to train trainers on a blended model for skill teaching. A moderator and a list of trainers were identified at the host institution. Invitations were sent to other institutions. The moderator briefed the participants through email. They were required to identify a topic for creating an e-learning module and asked to develop learning objectives, a standard operating procedure, and multiple-choice questions for the same. A 1.5-day programme was developed that included didactic lectures and small-group discussions on developing eModules. A feedback form using Google Forms was distributed among the participants to be completed after the programme. Results Thirty participants were enrolled. All were highly satisfied with the content of the workshop. Didactic lectures were completed on time. The duration in the breakout room for small group discussion was considered short. Twenty-eight participants felt that the workshop had sufficient learning points to keep the learner engaged for 1.5 days on a virtual platform. Only 3 participants were not satisfied with the use of a digital platform for this workshop. The content of the workshop regarding functioning and utility of the skill laboratory was perceived as useful for their institutional practice by 27 participants. Conclusion Virtual platforms can be used to conduct ToT workshops focusing on BL for skill acquisition.",

We studied the clinical profile and outcome of patients presenting and treated for AMI and Covid-19 infection. This retrospective, observational study was done at a single tertiary care centre in India from May 2021 to April 2022. Ten patients (8 males; median age 57 years) with confirmed Covid-19 and AMI diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria were included in the analysis. Associated comorbid conditions were present in 8 of 10 patients. The median interval from diagnosis of Covid-19 to onset of gastrointestinal symptoms was 11 days, with abdominal pain being the most common. Seven patients underwent surgical resection, while 3 patients were managed conservatively. Two patients were on antithrombotics before the development of AMI and had less severe involvement. Four patients died in hospital. AMI in Covid-19 infection is associated with morbidity and mortality. Previous antithrombotic use does not prevent the development of AMI but possibly reduces its severity.",

    "title": "Development of Telepresence Among Patients and Psychotherapists in the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model: Longitudinal Observational Study of 20 Dyads From a Randomized Trial on Video Consultations in Primary Care.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of video consultations in mental health care, highlighting the importance of therapeutic alliances for successful treatment outcomes in both face-to-face and web-based settings. Telepresence, the sense of being present with the mental health specialist (MHS) rather than feeling remote, is a critical component of building a strong therapeutic alliance in video consultations. While patients often report high telepresence levels, MHSs express concerns about whether video consultations can replicate the quality of face-to-face interactions. Despite its importance, research on telepresence development in MHSs over time and the dyadic interplay between patients and MHSs remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the mutual influence within patient-MHS dyads on telepresence development during video consultations, using data from a randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility of video consultations for depression and anxiety disorders in primary care. The study included 22 patient-MHS dyads (22 patients, 4 MHSs). Telepresence was measured using the Telepresence in Videoconference Scale. Dyadic data were analyzed using the actor-partner interdependence model with a distinguishable dyad structural equation model. Actor effects refer to the impact of an individual's telepresence at time point 1 (T1) on their telepresence at time point 2 (T2), while partner effects represent the influence of one party's telepresence at T1 on the other's telepresence at T2. Sensitivity analyses excluded data from individual MHSs to account for their unique effects. A significant actor effect for MHSs (P<.001) indicated a high temporal stability of telepresence between T1 and T2. In contrast, the actor effect for patients was not statistically significant, suggesting a greater variability between T1 and T2. No significant partner effects for both patients and MHSs were observed, suggesting no mutual influence between dyad members. Age was a significant covariate for telepresence in both groups. Consistent with prior findings, MHSs experienced increased telepresence over time, whereas patients reported high telepresence levels from the start of therapy. The lack of dyadic influence highlights the need for further exploration into factors affecting telepresence development, such as age, technical proficiency, and prior treatment experience. Future studies with larger samples and more sessions are necessary to enhance the generalizability of these findings and to optimize the use of video consultations in mental health care.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the comfort level of lidocaine-soaked swab for nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) patients. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal secretions from COVID-19 patients were collected using lidocaine-soaked swabs. COVID-19 patients were randomly divided into experimental group and control group, with 25 patients in each group. The first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (experimental group) was be soaked in lidocaine hydrochloride injection. The control group was tested for novel coronavirus nucleic acid by routine nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. Then, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in 2 groups by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Participants' discomfort was assessed by a visual analog scale. Then, the discomfort and cycle threshold (Ct) values after sampling were compared between the 2 groups. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study. There were no lidocaine-related complications during sampling. COVID-19 inpatients feel more comfortable with the use of lidocaine-soaked swabs (nasopharyngeal 3.44 ± 1.42 vs 5.68 ± 0.95, P < .01; oropharyngeal 4.4 ± 1.53 vs 8.92 ± 0.91, P < .01). Ct values of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were generally lower than those of oropharyngeal swab specimens. There was no statistically significant difference between Ct value results of the 2 groups. The use of lidocaine-soaked swabs for sampling of COVID-19 reduces patients' discomfort. This method is worth popularizing in novel coronavirus sampling. The use of lidocaine-soaked swabs for sampling of COVID-19 reduces patients' discomfort, which it has no obvious effect on Ct value. This method is worth popularizing in novel coronavirus sampling.",

    "abstract": "Modeling human behavior is essential to accurately predict epidemic spread, with behaviors like vaccine hesitancy complicating control efforts. While epidemic spread is often treated as a simple contagion, vaccine uptake may follow complex contagion dynamics, where individuals' decisions depend on multiple social contacts. Recently, the concept of complex contagion has received strong theoretical underpinnings thanks to the generalization of spreading phenomena from pairwise to higher-order interactions. Although several potential applications have been suggested, examples of complex contagions motivated by real data remain scarce. Surveys on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the United States suggest that vaccination attitudes may indeed depend on the vaccination status of social peers, aligning with complex contagion principles. In this work, we examine the interactions between epidemic spread, vaccination, and vaccine uptake attitudes under complex contagion. Using the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with a dynamic, threshold-based vaccination campaign, we simulate scenarios on an age-structured multilayer network informed by U.S. contact data. Our results offer insights into the role of social dynamics in shaping vaccination behavior and epidemic outcomes.",

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Hepatitis C-related research in the EMR using bibliometric analysis. Between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2024, a bibliometric search was conducted using the Scopus database to identify Hepatitis C-related publications from countries in the EMR. The analysis was performed using the R-based Bibliometrix tool, which examined research productivity trends, recent themes, thematic evolution, and co-occurrence networks of terms. The analysis identified 9,357 publications with an 8.06% annual growth rate and 170,021 total citations. Two distinct research clusters emerged: treatment regimens and epidemiological studies. Thematic evolution revealed a consistent focus on cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, while treatment approaches shifted from interferon-based therapies to direct-acting antivirals. Analysis of genotype-related research highlighted the regional importance of Genotype 4. Recent trends indicated integrating Hepatitis C research with broader public health concerns like COVID-19. The Hepatitis C research landscape in the EMR is dynamic and maturing, characterized by substantial growth, diversification of research themes, and adoption of advanced treatment strategies. The findings underscore the need for continued multidisciplinary efforts and a focus on emerging themes to advance Hepatitis C management further and improve regional patient outcomes.",

Using World Health Organization guidelines, this cohort event monitoring (CEM) study was conducted to assess the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines, in seven cities in Iran. A total of 89783 participants (31690 Sinopharm, 20195 Sputnik V, 23780 AZD1222, and 14118 CoVIran Barekat) who were 18 or older were followed up for 17 weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222) after receiving the first dose of vaccine by weekly phone contacts or self-reporting in a web application. Furthermore, all hospitalized cases were investigated for causes of admission by classification committees. A total of 11 cases (cumulative incidence: 12.3 per 100,000) of AESIs were recorded. All of the AESI cases were observed among 2080 hospitalized cases. The AESIs included five cases of coagulation disorders (three after AZD1222 and two after Sinopharm vaccination), and three cases of generalized seizure (one after Sputnik V, and two cases after AZD1222). In addition, two cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, and Sub-acute Thyroiditis were detected after receiving Sputnik V, and one individual developed pericarditis after receiving COVIran Barekat. We found around one AESI among every 8,000 vaccinated Iranian people. The incidence of AESIs after COVID-19 vaccines was relatively rare and the studied vaccines can be considered safe. AZD1222 had a higher incidence of AESIs. Coagulation disorders, and generalized seizure were the main and most common AESIs.",

    "title": "Characterization of a MERS-related betacoronavirus in Danish brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus).",
    "abstract": "Bats are recognized as natural reservoir hosts for numerous viruses and are believed to be the evolutionary origin of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses (CoVs), such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and possibly MERS-CoV. MERS-related beta-CoVs have been identified in bat species from Africa, America, Asia, and Europe. In this study, we describe the first detection and characterization of a MERS-related beta-CoV in Danish brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus). Fecal samples collected through a national surveillance program were screened using pan-CoV RT-qPCRs. Positive samples underwent ORF1b sequencing, microarray analysis and Illumina MiSeq sequencing, followed by metagenomic assembly of full-length genomes. A global phylogenetic tree was used to determine placement within the Coronaviridae family and local maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis clarified subgroup placement. The receptor-binding potential of the spike protein to human DPP4, ACE2, and bat ACE2 orthologs was assessed through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), alongside homology modeling and structural analysis. Three samples tested positive for CoVs. One sample from a Soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) was identified as alpha-CoV by ORF1b sequencing. The remaining two samples, obtained from a colony of Plecotus auritus, were identified as beta-CoVs, and separate microarray results indicated the presence of a MERS-related CoV. Full genomes were successfully assembled using a metagenomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis placed them within the merbecoviruses, forming a distinct clade with viruses detected in Vespertilionidae bats from Western Europe and East Asia. Analysis of the RBD placed them within the HKU25 clade. Structural modeling suggested hydrogen bonding patterns between the RBD and human/bat ACE2 orthologs or human DPP4, similar to known in vitro complexes, indicating potential receptor binding. This is the first report of MERS-related beta-CoVs in bats from Denmark. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that these novel viruses belong to the HKU25 clade, a clade with known ACE2 receptor preference. Experimental validation is needed to confirm the receptor-binding potential, as additional interactions at the RBD-receptor interface may differ from previously described bat-merbecoviruses. Continued surveillance is crucial to identify potential intermediate hosts and assess interspecies transmission risk, with focus on the spike protein, receptor specificity, and binding affinity.",

    "abstract": "Given the ongoing global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely fueled by self-medication with antibiotics (SMA), this study offers important insights from southern Tehran-an underrepresented region in national data-regarding the prevalence and determinants of SMA. We investigated several previously underexplored key factors, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, lifestyle, mental health, and COVID-19 history. A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in three major regions of southern Tehran in 2023, involving 1,311 adult participants who were selected through stratified random sampling with probability proportional to size. A structured composite index was developed using data on lifestyle factors such as body mass index, physical activity, smoking, nutrition, mental and physical health, socioeconomic status, and frequency of SMA. Of the participants, 50.4% were male and 49.6% female, with an overall SMA prevalence of 21.3% (n = 279). Higher education (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.25-2.96, p value = 0.003), higher SES (AOR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.82-6.82, p value < 0.001), basic insurance (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.10-2.63, p value = 0.019), and a history of uncomplicated COVID-19 infection (AOR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.44-3.78, p value = 0.001) were significantly associated with increased SMA. In contrast, a healthy lifestyle (AOR = 0.66, p value = 0.033) and good mental health (AOR = 0.31, p value < 0.001) were associated with lower SMA rates. Our findings primarily suggest that we should focus our public health efforts on specific subpopulations affected by SMA. Community-based antibiotic stewardship programs should use educational and behavioral approaches with an emphasis on mental health and health literacy. Policymakers should also consider whether to modify regulations to prevent the general public from obtaining antibiotics without a prescription. Finally, the findings from a representative sample from southern Tehran illustrate the value of local data in national AMR decision-making and avoiding assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Research is a key driver in improving the quality of care in health settings. The UK Government has published its strategy to increase research within the National Health Service (NHS) and to implement lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We investigated the current research interest, culture, and capacity amongst staff in one medium-sized, regional Health Board in Scotland to determine how research activity may be increased and how attitudes to research may have changed following the recent pandemic. This study was part of a two-phase evaluation with both quantitative and qualitative methods using an initial questionnaire (n = 503) and then semi-structured interviews with 28 staff recruited following completion of their questionnaire. Results from the first phase have been published; this paper presents the results of the second phase. The interview explored the perception of the research culture and capacity at an organisational, team and individual level. Topics included perceived barriers and facilitators for engaging in research activities and the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on changes in attitude to research within the NHS. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. Respondents comprised 7 nurses/midwives, 6 doctors/dentists, 3 allied health professionals, 3 other therapeutic and 9 admin/support staff. All respondents identified similar facilitators and barriers to undertaking research, irrespective of their role or experience with research. Four key themes were: the influence of structural and professional differences, the need for protected time, access to resources, and increased visibility of research. Responses varied between staff grades; those with research embedded as part of their training and professional role expressed more accepting views to undertaking research. Issues identified were the provision of protected time, skills training, practical support from research facilitators working in clinical teams, active encouragement by managers, improved communication, and the adoption of a research strategy at Board level. Research activity declined during the pandemic, but respondents expressed an increased awareness of the importance of research as a priority in improving health outcomes during the pandemic. The research interest and culture in our Health Board could be improved by addressing the four broad themes identified, thereby increasing research capacity in line with Government aspirations. The findings may have relevance for small to medium-sized Health Boards in the UK and elsewhere when responding to the call to increase their research profile.",

The results were evaluated with a reliability level of 95%, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. In our study, we found that the prepandemic group had lower baseline anxiety than did the postpandemic group, which was also found after the OSCE. The results of the OSCE were good and not related to the stress or anxiety that might be caused by the exam in either group. We found a decline in academic performance after the pandemic, although with better access scores.

Using a novel, self-contained containment level 3 chamber, we aerosolized the virus in different environmental conditions then collected droplets on nasal tissue, cell lines, or different materials to measure the transmission of infectious SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 survival was much shorter than previously reported for the potential of fomite transmission. Temperature, relative humidity and the presence of incinerated tobacco, cannabis, or vape products had no discernible impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosolized droplets, but affected the survival of VSV, a non-respiratory enveloped virus. When compared to USA-WA1/2020 and the Omicron variant, Delta SARS-CoV-2 had the greatest survival during aerosolization. These findings suggest that respiratory enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2 may have and may be continuing to evolve higher transmission fitness through droplets.",

Data were collected at baseline and 12-weeks in 2019-2023. DTC enrolled more participants, but CBO recruited more Black (11.7% vs. 21.7%) and Latino YMSM (27.3% vs. 32.9%). CBO enrollees were at higher HIV risk based on condomless anal sex (p < .05) and rectal Gonorrhea rates (p < .01). Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use with adherence was 1.94 times higher at follow-up vs. baseline (p < .0001) across arms, PrEP increase was 1.60 times higher in CBO vs. DTC (p < .0001).

Our discussion emphasized the critical role of immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, and cytokine storms in pneumonia development, alongside immune-mediated lung damage and thrombotic complications. Clinically, we summarized evolving diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and intensive care protocols, all with a focus on the pivotal role of immunology in pneumonia management. Looking forward, we advocated for a comprehensive approach to addressing ongoing pneumonia challenges, including strengthening epidemic surveillance and advancing immunotherapy research to target abnormal immune responses. Additionally, refining vaccine strategies for durable immunity against evolving viral strains was deemed essential. Overall, this review underscored the central role of immunology in shaping pneumonia management post-COVID-19, aiming to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and immunological responses in the post-pandemic era.",

    "abstract": "Co-administering vaccines can effectively enhance vaccination uptake in adults. Despite the potential benefits, there is limited data supporting this practice. We investigated the immunogenicity and safety of co-administering COVID-19 mRNA, Influenza, and Pneumococcal (PPSV23) vaccines in adults. As part of the national vaccination program, 3,104 adults received a fourth dose (2nd booster) of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alone or coadministered with an influenza vaccine, with or without PPSV23 from January to December 2022. We measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG concentrations and neutralization activity before and one month after vaccination. We estimated the odds of a ≥2-fold geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) and adverse events (AEs) using logistic regression models. The median age of the 3,104 participants was 70 years (IQR: 60-77); 1,670 (54%) were female. Anti-spike IgG GMFRs were 1.95, 1.56, and 1.42, while for neutralization activity, values were 8.99, 12.42, and 8.23, in the COVID-19, COVID-19+Influenza, and COVID-19+Influenza+PPSV23 groups, respectively. The adjusted odds of a ≥2-fold anti-spike IgG GMFR were 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.43 (p < 0.001), and for neutralization activity, 0.96 (p = 0.833) and 0.97 (p = 0.954), for COVID-19+Influenza and COVID-19+Influenza+PPSV23, respectively. The odds for anti-RBD GMFRs followed similar patterns. Systemic AEs were more common in the COVID-19+Influenza+PPSV23 group (adjusted OR: 2.04, p < 0.001), though no serious AEs were reported. Co-administering COVID-19, Influenza, and PPSV23 vaccines seems feasible, without significantly impairing neutralizing antibody responses. These findings support the recommendation for vaccine coadministration in adults.",

    "abstract": "Using data on Norwegian adolescents, this study aimed to explore changes in mental health, quality of life, somatic health complaints and loneliness from before and one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, also considering the changes according to socioeconomic position (SEP). The study involved a cross-sectional comparative design with data from Young-HUNT4 (2017-2019) (n = 4347) and Young-HUNT COVID (May/June 2021) (n = 2033), aged 16-19 years. Additionally, longitudinal changes from Young-HUNT4 (n = 1565), aged 13-15 years, with follow-up in Young-HUNT COVID were explored. The impact of SEP was investigated through regression analyses and investigating prevalence changes in high and low SEP groups. In the cross-sectional comparison, boys and girls reported higher levels of loneliness and mental distress (boys only) into the pandemic compared to before, while general health and quality of life remained stable. Longitudinally, all factors changed adversely except for general health in boys. Comparing younger (13-15 years) with older (16-19 years) adolescents from Young-HUNT4, demonstrated the same adverse pattern as in the longitudinal sample. Poor health, poor quality of life and loneliness were more prevalent in the low compared to the high SEP group. In the low SEP group, mental distress, poor general health and life quality worsened in boys while improved in girls during the study period. Except for mental distress in boys, general health and life quality did not deteriorate in the study period, although loneliness increased in both sexes. In the low SEP group, girls seemed to cope better than boys where health and well-being even improved.",

    "title": "Potential ecological risk and accumulation of heavy metal(loid)s in soils of Macao in China as a non-industrial and tourist City.",
    "abstract": "With rapid industrialization, the accumulation and contamination of heavy metal(loid)s in soil often has occurred. However, the accumulation of heavy metal(loid)s in soil in non-industrial and tourist cities with high population densities is not well known. Therefore, the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) was taken as an example to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in the characteristics of soil heavy metal(loid)s in non-industrial and tourist cities. The total concentrations of heavy metal(loid)s (As, Co, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Zn) in soil as well as the ecological risk in different functional areas and geographic locations were studied by combining statistical analysis, the land accumulation index, and the potential ecological risk index. Finally, the data in 2018 and 2023 were compared. The results show that in terms of spatial distribution, the high CVs (coefficients of variation) of 0.67 and 0.73 for Cr and Hg, respectively, showed Cr and Hg were more likely to have point sources of contamination. The skewness value of 0.16 for Zn suggests that the distribution may be slightly skewed and flat, with a more uniform distribution, probably due to the high-density distribution of the population and atmospheric deposition. Compared with other areas, heavy metal(loid) concentrations in soils were generally higher in the Macao Peninsula, which may be related to the higher population of waste incineration plants and residential areas located there. Geographically, Hg concentrations in soils were higher near the airport and transportation areas than in other areas. From 2018 to 2023, heavy metal(loid)s (except Zn) in the soils of Macao did not increase significantly but showed a decreasing trend due to tourism-oriented activities, high rainfall, the absence of industry, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Cr, Cd, Zn, and Hg occur more frequently in the lower concentration ranges than the other heavy metal(loid)s and generally show decreasing trends. Although the potential ecological risk of heavy metal(loid)s in Macao was generally low, As had the highest potential risk. Most of the lightly contaminated sites (62%) had a higher geo-accumulation index of Zn than for the other heavy metal(loid)s. This paper can be used as the data support for future research on soil heavy metal(loid) distribution and government policies for non-industrial cities.",

    "abstract": "This observational study described the prevalence and associated factors of substance use (SU) among adolescent gamblers, comparing data from pre and post pandemic surveys among 7,960 adolescents between 14 and 18 years old from a Nationwide Population-Based Study (ESTUDES) conducted in Spain. The independent effect of socio-demographic characteristics, video game and internet-related variables, perceived health risks from consumption, and the perceived availability of substances on SU in adolescent gamblers were estimated. Alcohol and marijuana were the most commonly reported substances, and they were the only ones that presented a significant reduction in prevalence in 2021. Adolescent gamblers who reported having easy access to substances were more likely to consume alcohol (OR:2.92, 95%CI:1.95-4.37), marijuana (OR:5.98, 95%CI:4.72-7.57), TSSp (OR:2.12, 95%CI:1.70-2.65), cocaine (OR:5.15, 95%CI:3.81-6.98) and new substances (OR:2.25, 95%CI:1. 80-2.82). Likewise, adolescents who gambled and did not perceive health-related risk for using were more likely to consume alcohol (OR:1.52, 95%CI:1.21-1.90), marijuana (OR:3.16, 95%CI:2.64-3.77), TSSp (OR:1.84, 95%CI:1.41-2.40), cocaine (OR:5.44, 95%CI:3.57-8.28) and other substances (OR:3.20, 95%CI:2.09-4.90). Among the implications are the development of programs aimed at higher-risk consumption, the continuation and strengthening of programs to raise awareness of the risk of drug consumption, and the re-evaluation of current measures to control access to legal and illegal substances by adolescents.",

    "title": "Uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among female healthcare workers in Syria: results from a 2022 cross-sectional survey.",
    "abstract": "Healthcare workers play an important role in administering COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in conflict-affected settings. Syria has endured a protracted conflict for over a decade and while most of the healthcare workers in the country have been vaccinated with at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, vaccinating all of them would reduce their risk of COVID-19 complications, given their daily interactions with patients. The goal of this study was to better understand the main barriers to uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among female healthcare workers in Syria. Using data from a wider national survey of 17,000 respondents conducted between October and November 2022, we analysed a sub-sample of 4136 responses from female healthcare workers, across 14 Governorates. The main outcome of interest was vaccination status, (vaccinated, willing (but not yet vaccinated), unsure about vaccination and finally, those unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine). We present descriptive information about the sample and conduct a multivariate logistic regression analysis to shed light on some of the barriers preventing COVID-19 vaccination uptake. We find that the vast majority (93.7%) of female healthcare workers have received at least one COVID-19 vaccination dose. We find that attitudes and beliefs around COVID-19 vaccines impact upon the decision to get a vaccination-positive attitudes around effectiveness and safety of the vaccines increase the likelihood of being vaccinated or willing to be vaccinated. More specifically, healthcare workers which believe in the safety of the vaccines are twice as likely to get vaccinated relative to those who don't. By contrast, we find that neutral attitudes regarding the vaccines are associated with vaccine indecision among female healthcare workers. In addition, we also find that female healthcare workers tend to trust COVID-19 vaccine information from their peers-close to 99% of vaccinated female healthcare workers tend to trust the vaccine information received from their peers. While the vaccination rates among healthcare workers are high, the results could further help in devising strategies for tackling the structural and individual barriers towards vaccine uptake among healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe complication that arises between two and six weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "A longitudinal qualitative study of clinical nurses caring for hospitalized adults during the first fifteen months of COVID-19: lessons in professional survival and leadership.",
    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to record and analyze the initial and lingering thoughts and reactions that 41 clinical nurses experienced while caring for individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 during the initial April 2020 surge and over the next 15 months while vaccines and effective treatments became available. The sample represented a diverse group of nurses at one American health care institution in terms of gender identity, age, ethnic group, years of experience, clinical specialty area, and hospital shift worked. At the time of this April surge, nurses were exposed to a virus with no standard treatments and high mortality rates. Using a longitudinal qualitative design, the team hoped to answer questions about what compelled these nurses to continue to come to work? And what leadership lessons about identity, communication, camaraderie can be learned from this unplanned crisis? A longitudinal design was chosen to capture the changes in nurses’ thoughts about themselves as professionals and their clinical work during COVID-19 after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli, Acta Biomed 91(1):157–60, 2020 [1]). The research team wondered how a large American suburban medical center staff was dealing with this virus and if there were changing patterns in the experiences and thoughts of clinical nurses as the virus evolved in 2020–2021. We applied the 18th Century philosophy of Immanuel Kant writings on moral thinking to examine the nurses’ thoughts of continuing their clinical work during this time. Using a classic Western philosopher seemed relevant given the worldwide nature of the pandemic which affected everyone, not just health care workers. Interview questions from the literature and research team experiences were developed; an additional file provides details of the interview schedule in English (See Additional file 1 for the interview schedule). Forty-one RNs agreed to participate; each nurse agreed to three interviews over three phases. The first phase occurred from April through November 2020 with 41 RNs participating. Thirty-five RNs from the original 41 returned for a second interview between November 2020 through April 2021. In the final phase the same 35 RNs took part in a final interview between April 2021 and July 2021. We asked the same questions to all nurses during each phase. Similar quotations were grouped into 42 codes, then like codes were collected into five themes: Exposure risk, Professional Self-Image, Communication, Community Reaction and Finding an Emotional Balance. These themes provided a context for describing the ethos of nurses working with pandemic patients. These nurses put the needs of the greater community before their personal desires. They came to work every day because they believed that they had essential knowledge and skills to help in the pandemic. Despite the realization that many of their patients would die, the nurses adapted their skills within strict isolation protocols. Their greatest stress was infecting their families, a misfortune that did not happen. Effective leadership and the camaraderie that developed among the nurses and other staff sustained them during this time. Interview quotations seemed to mirror interviews conducted by one team researcher on military nurses who served in Vietnam (1962–1975). Comparing these citations suggests that the personal danger, inability to save people and an overwhelming number of patients that taxed resources were similar to veteran and civilian nurses. The 35 clinical nurses in this study worked through the initial fifteen months of COVID-19 pandemic in America. Kant’s idea of duty for the greater good over personal needs provided an explanation and rationale why the 35 clinical nurses remained in clinical work. Reviewing the transcripts indicated that there seemed to be parallels between nurses’ clinical experiences in the Vietnam War and the COVID-19. Their experience indicated that planning for future disasters is imprecise. Knowledge gleaned from this study suggests that a combination of external factors and personal assets should provide the support for nurses and other health care workers in future plagues.

Retrospective cohort study of globe injury repair mechanisms in the TriNetX United States Collaborative Network database from 2013 to 2023. CPT codes from the ICD-10 classification system were utilized to identify repair methods for globe injuries (65275, 65280, 65285, 65286). Demographics were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA for age and chi-squared tests for race, ethnicity, and sex. Incidence and prevalence were analyzed yearly and cumulatively. Of the 119,347,853 subjects in TriNetX, 231,286 cases of globe injuries were identified. Demographics varied by repair category for age and sex ratios. An ANOVA showed a significant difference between age distribution over the four subtypes (mean age 47.2 ± 21.6 years, p < 0.001). The most common procedure was repair of non-perforating corneal lacerations with or without foreign body removal (n = 182,193) and was the only cohort with a female-predominant population (n = 119,990; 65.89%). Chi-squared tests revealed significant differences by sex (p < 0.001), ethnicity (p < 0.001), and race (p < 0.001). Incidence showed variation from 2013 to 2019; however, a large decrease in incidence was noted from 2019 to 2021. Our findings align with previous research indicating decreased globe injury incidence during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, except for perforating corneal and/or scleral lacerations without uveal tissue involvement. Our study reveals a shift towards higher affected female population than previous literature.",

With two vaccine candidates shown to reduce infectiousness, there is a need to better understand transmission of MERS-CoV in camels and assess the potential impact of vaccination. To help address this, we used age-stratified seroprevalence data and a combination of modelling methodologies to estimate key epidemiological quantities including MERS-CoV transmissibility in camels and to estimate vaccine impact on infection incidence. Transmissibility was higher in West Asia (R0 interquartile range 7-14) compared to Africa (3-5) and South Asia (2-3), highlighting the need for setting-specific vaccination strategies. Modelling suggested that even if the vaccine only reduced infectiousness rather than susceptibility to infection, vaccinating calves could achieve large reductions in incidence in moderate and high transmission settings, and interrupt transmission in low transmission settings, provided coverage was high (70-90%).",

    "abstract": "As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)-an immune negative modulator-and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.",

Main characteristics were balanced across arms. Most of the participants were infected with BA.2 (52%) or BA.4/5 (35.5%).

    "abstract": "Despite abundant evidence illustrating the impact of social determinants of health on children and youth from marginalised communities, their continued marginalisation in research contributes to a negative feedback loop that perpetuates health inequities. Previous reviews have identified barriers in marginalised adult communities. However, no comprehensive review outlines the scope of barriers to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in child health research across multiple marginalised communities, particularly as they are defined in Canada. The purpose of this review is to scope and summarise research discussing systemic barriers influencing EDI in child health research, focusing on racialised and black individuals, 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals, Indigenous peoples, women and girls and individuals with disabilities (identified as priority communities in the Canadian government's research policy). Our team followed the steps proposed by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews. From 3336 identified records, 53 publications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were based in the USA (n=40) and/or other English-speaking countries (n=14), emphasising the need for global perspectives. Some publications were based in more than one country; others addressed more than one marginalised community. We identified more publications discussing racialised individuals (n=30) and black individuals (n=20) than women and girls (n=10), Indigenous peoples (n=9), children with disabilities (n=7) or 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals (n=4). Publications increased from 3 in 2020 to 15 in 2022, reflecting heightened awareness of structural racism and health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest systemic under-recruitment and tokenism. Other factors in the research ecosystem include misleading conceptualisations of race and other social categories, power dynamics, lack of cultural safety and discrimination. Finally, we recommend applying the socio-ecological model to systematically map barriers and develop tailored, multilevel solutions that promote equity and inclusivity in research. To foster a more equitable and impactful child health research ecosystem, institutions must address individual, interpersonal, organisational and policy-level barriers by embedding community-driven priorities, promoting diverse and inclusive practices, and ensuring long-term, reciprocal relationships with historically marginalised communities.",

Participants: Convenient sample (n  =  551) college students took an online survey between December 2020-February 2021 [Y1]. Follow-up (December 2021-February 2022) [Y2] from Y1, (n  =  131). Methods: FI measured via USDA Short Form Food Security Module. Stress and depression measured via PSS-10 and CES-D. Results: Y1, 31.3% FI. FI had lower mean GPA, were less likely to tell a parent about a food shortage, but more likely to be on financial aid, part-time employed, non-white, first-generation, full-time, and live off-campus compared to food secure [FS] (p ≤ .05* for all). FI had higher mean CES-D [28.45 ± 8.38 vs. 23.50 ± 7.98] and PSS-10 [24.39 ± 3.76 vs. 23.40 ± 3.69] (p < .01*). Y2, FI increased to 39.7%. FI had higher CES-D scores [29.11 ± 10.24 vs. 21.30 ± 6.80] and PSS-10 scores [23.81 ± 3.53 vs. 22.44 ± 3.25] (p ≤ .03*). Conclusions: FI, stress, and depression worsened from Y1 to Y2 due to increased employment, financial aid, and limited familial support.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the epidemiological characteristics of common respiratory pathogens across three distinct periods: before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, We aimed to determine whether new trends in the transmission of respiratory pathogens would emerge as non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPIs) were gradually lifted. We analyzed the differences observed between the pre-epidemic, epidemic and post-epidemic periods. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series model was employed to predict future trends of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infections. MP infections were most prevalent among adolescents, exhibiting a positive rate of 46.73 %, whereas RSV infections were observed primarily in neonates with a rate of 24.30 %, followed by infants at 14.74 %. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, MP was identified as the predominant pathogen. However, during the pandemic, there was a marked decline in the positive detection rates of both MP and Influenza A( IAV), while the positive rate of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)significantly increased. In period three, the trend of RSV remained relatively stable, and the levels of IAVwere consistent with those observed prior to the period one. Conversely, the proportion of MP rose substantially, with its detection rate rebounding to 29.00 %. The positive detection rates for Influenza B (IBV) and adenovirus (ADV) remained largely stable throughout the three periods. During the three periods, a shift in the age distribution of MP infections was noted, with the majority of cases occurring in the 3-17 year age group following the epidemic. Furthermore, according to the predictions of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a decline in the trend of MP epidemic is anticipated in the forthcoming few months.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by the production of various antibodies, with immunoglobulin M (IgM) being the initial isotype synthesized. Lead (Pb), a toxic heavy metal, accumulates in biological systems and disrupts multiple biochemical processes, potentially modulating immune function through alterations in cytokine production and antibody levels. This study aimed to elucidate the early immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in lead-exposed individuals by examining antibody profiles and associated immunological parameters. A cohort of 277 male employees from a zinc and lead smelting facility in Poland was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Participants were stratified into IgM-positive (n=13) and IgM/IgG/IgA-negative (n=149) groups. Biomarkers of inflammation, hematological parameters, and oxidative stress were analyzed. The IgM-positive group exhibited significantly elevated levels of cytokines, including a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), B cell activating factor (BAFF), interleukin-20 (IL-20), pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNF-R2). A significantly higher level of IgM antibody levels was observed in individuals with higher zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) concentrations. However, no significant differences in blood lead levels (PbB), oxidative stress markers, or hematological parameters were detected between the groups. Elevated levels of APRIL, BAFF, IL-20, sTNF-R2, and PTX-3 in lead-exposed individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection may indicate robust dendritic cell and B cell activation and enhanced modulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) activity. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental lead exposure and the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Adipose inflammation plays a key role in obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities. Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, is a molecular link between environmental factors and complex diseases. Here we found that high fat diet (HFD) feeding induced a dynamic change of DNA methylome in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) analyzed by reduced representative bisulfite sequencing. Interestingly, DNA methylation at the promoter of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) was significantly increased by HFD, concomitant with a down-regulation of Esr1 expression. HFD feeding in mice increased the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Dnmt3a, and binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3a to Esr1 promoter in WAT. Mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt1 deficiency displayed increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity upon HFD challenge; while mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt3a deficiency showed a mild metabolic phenotype. Using a modified CRISPR/RNA-guided system to specifically target DNA methylation at the Esr1 promoter in WAT, we found that reducing DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-challenged mice. Our study demonstrated that DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter played an important role in regulating adipose inflammation, which may contribute to obesity-induced insulin resistance.",

We used these data to calibrate, on a patient-specific basis, our previously developed biology-based mathematical model describing the spatiotemporal change in the number of tumor cells. After calibrating the mathematical model to the V1 and V2 MRI data, the calibrated model predicted the patient-specific tumor status at V3 by explicitly accounting for tumor cell movement (constrained by the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue), proliferation, and death due to treatment. The concordance correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted tumor change from V1 to V3 was 0.94 for total cellularity and 0.91 for volume. A logistic regression model of predicted tumor volume metrics from V1 to V3 differentiated pCR from non-pCR patients with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78. Our tumor forecasting pipeline can accurately predict tumor status after an NAT course-on a patient-specific basis, without a training dataset-using \"real-world\" MRI data obtained from a multi-subtype, multi-site clinical trial.",

We generated an immunocompetent MCL model by overexpressing the key oncogenic drivers SOX11 and CCND1 under the Eµ enhancer in C57BL/6 mice, aiming to replicate human MCL's biological and pathological features. Eµ-SOX11CCND1 mice developed lymphoma marked by clonal B1a cell expansion in lymphatic and extranodal tissues. Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and transcriptional profiling revealed strong similarity to human MCL, with pathway analysis confirming significant molecular overlap. Importantly, lymphoma cells could be adoptively transferred into wild-type recipients, enabling therapeutic testing within an intact immune system. The Eµ-SOX11CCND1 mouse represents a robust and biologically relevant model that faithfully recapitulates human MCL. Its immunocompetent nature and adoptive transfer capability make it a valuable model for studying disease mechanisms and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches for MCL patients.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates a reduced incidence of multiple cancers in users of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), drugs widely used for glycemic control and weight reduction that modulate several key regulators of metabolism. We sought to examine their association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes in overweight and obese patients and gain mechanistic insights from mouse models. Two clinical cohorts of overweight and obese NSCLC patients-one undergoing surgical resection (n=1,177, 71 GLP-1RA users) and another receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs; n=300, 10 GLP-1RA users), were propensity score matched for relevant covariates and analyzed for clinical outcomes. GLP-1RA use was associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight and obese patients (HR=0.41 [95%CI=0.16-1.04], p=0.026) after lobectomy. GLP-1RA treatment reduced tumor burden in obese but not normal-weight mice and altered the frequency and phenotypes of leukocyte populations and gene expression patterns in obese tumors, crucial to cancer progression and anti-tumor immunity. Concurrent GLP-1RA and immunotherapy was associated with improved overall (0.41 [0.16-1.01], 0.027) and progression-free survival (HR=0.31, [0.10-0.94], 0.019) for patients with advanced NSCLC. In our cohort, GLP-1RAs enhanced lung cancer-specific clinical outcomes and augment immunotherapy efficacy.

Such compounds were endowed in vitro with distinct inhibition profiles for the human (h) Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) and showed preferential agonisms for the β3-AR subtype. Among them, 14 induced remarkable intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering in an in vivo transient model of ocular hypertension, with the maximal effect at 120 min post-administration at 1% w/v concentration. Furthermore, the high stability of the compounds in rabbit plasma and their ability to induce full vasodilation in isolated porcine retinal arteries suggested that the observed in vivo effects likely result from a combination of conventional aqueous humor reduction and modulation of ocular vascular tone, both of which are mediated by CAs and β-ARs. The pronounced melanosomal accumulation of representative compounds 14 and 16 highlights their potential as ideal candidates for evaluating pharmacokinetic profiles in ophthalmic applications. The results of this study provide strong evidence for the biomedical repurposing of a neglected metabolite through a novel class of dual-targeting ligands, also offering a promising strategy to help counteract the ongoing decline in drug discovery.",

Here, we proposed a single-cell mass spectrometry (MS) platform assisted by a photochemical derivatization (PCD) method termed Visible-light-activated Ru(bpy)32+-catalyzed Singlet Oxygen-mediated Hydroperoxidation (VRSOH), for the rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple lipid C═C location isomers in living cell membranes at the single-cell level. First, the VRSOH method combined with MS analysis achieved the localization of C═C bonds in mono- and polyunsaturated lipids and cellular lipid extracts. Then, based on the home-built rapid single-cell MS platform and Ru-L, a modified form of Ru(bpy)32+ that allowed the VRSOH method to be applied to living cell membranes, 15 lipid C═C location isomers from the top-ranked phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in both primary and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were quantified with a throughput of ∼16 cells/min. The results also revealed specific lipidomic patterns associated with CRC metastasis and the existence of subgroups with distinct migration potentials in metastatic CRC cells. In light of the lipidomic pattern discovery, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) may serve as a potential target for CRC metastasis prevention.",

    "abstract": "Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used as a promising tool for scalable, accessible, and personalized self-management support of people with a chronic disease. Studies of CAs for self-management of chronic disease operate within a multidisciplinary domain: self-management originates from (behavioral) psychology and CAs stem from intervention technology, while diseases are typically studied within the biomedical context. To ensure their effectiveness, structured evaluations and descriptions of the interventions, integrating biomedical, behavioral, and technological perspectives, are essential. We aimed to examine the design and evaluation of CAs for self-management support of chronic diseases, focusing on their characteristics, integration of behavioral change techniques, and evaluation methods. The findings will guide future research and inform intervention design. We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases to identify studies that investigated CAs for chronic disease self-management, published from January 1, 2018, to April 15, 2024. Full-text journal articles, published in English, studying the efficacy or effectiveness of a CA in the context of self-management for chronic diseases in adults were included. Data extraction was guided by conceptual frameworks to ensure comprehensive reporting of intervention and methodologies: the behavioral intervention technology model and the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) checklist. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool (version 2). In total, 25 studies were included, primarily focusing on text-based, rule-based CAs delivered via a mobile apps. The chronic diseases predominantly targeted were diabetes and cancer. Commonly identified clusters of behavior change techniques were \"shaping knowledge,\" \"feedback and monitoring,\" \"natural consequences,\" and \"associations.\" However, reporting of behavior change techniques and their delivery was lacking, and intervention descriptions were limited. Studies were mostly in the early phase, with a great variety in intervention descriptions, study methods, and outcome measures. Advancing the field of CA-based interventions requires transparent intervention descriptions, rigorous methodologies, consistent use of validated scales, standardized taxonomy, and reporting aligned with standardized frameworks. Enhanced integration of artificial intelligence-driven personalization and a focus on implementation in health care settings are critical for future research.",

    "abstract": "Ergothioneine (ERG), a unique, naturally occurring antioxidant of dietary origin, is gaining increasing attention due to its crucial roles in human health and diseases. Despite its significance, ERG is rarely detected in biospecimens by mass spectrometry (MS) and, to date, has not been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, two widely used analytical techniques in metabolomics. In this study, we investigated human plasma, whole blood (WB), and red blood cells (RBC), as well as mouse blood and tissues, combining NMR, LC-MS, and ratio analysis techniques. The results demonstrate the ability of simple 1D 1H NMR to routinely identify and quantify ERG in various biological samples. The levels of ERG vary widely and depend on the type of biological sample, with human RBC exhibiting remarkably high concentrations, often exceeding 1.5 mM. The average levels of ERG in human plasma, WB, and RBC were in ratios of 1:70:140, respectively. Moreover, ERG levels showed a linear correlation between plasma and WB (R2 = 0.59), plasma and RBC (R2 = 0.75), and WB and RBC (R2 = 0.98). In mice, ERG levels exhibit a distinct whole-body distribution, with average levels in the mouse skeletal muscle, brain, heart, kidney, and liver in ratios of 0:1:10:35:45, respectively. The demonstration of surprisingly high levels of ERG in biological samples using 1H NMR opens new avenues for its analysis using both NMR and MS methods to explore its roles in human health and diseases, as part of routine global or targeted metabolomics studies.",

    "abstract": "Precise control of the morphology of self-assembling drugs is critical for optimizing their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. However, adapting a single drug for diverse therapeutic applications by tailoring its structure remains a central challenge. Here, we report a hydrogen-bond-guided strategy to program the morphology of a paclitaxel derivative, PTP, by introducing a phosphate group to promote supramolecular organization. PTP molecules spontaneously formed nanofibers in aqueous environments via directional hydrogen bonding. Through rational coassembly with polyethylene glycol 400 or hyaluronic acid, the nanofibers were, respectively, transformed into spherical nanoparticles (PTP@PEG) or bundled fibers (PTP@HA), enabling tailored pharmacological performance. PTP@PEG enhanced systemic circulation, reduced renal accumulation, and improved antitumor efficacy in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model following intravenous administration. In contrast, PTP@HA exhibited sustained release and potent therapeutic effects in a peritoneal metastasis model of colorectal cancer via intraperitoneal injection. This work demonstrates how tunable hydrogen bonding enables precise programming of drug assembly morphology, offering a versatile platform to expand the therapeutic applications of a single drug across multiple diseases. Tuning the nanostructure of one drug using simple excipients via hydrogen bonds presents a simple and effective approach over designing new carriers, potentially revitalizing drugs previously limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles.",

Despite advances in therapeutic regimens, the incidence of metastatic CRC is increasing due to the development of resistance to conventional treatments. Metastases, particularly in the liver and lungs, represent the leading cause of death and poor prognosis in CRC patients. Recent evidence demonstrates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in communication between cancer cells and the surrounding environment. Understanding the potential mechanisms underlying EV-driven metastasis and tumor progression could facilitate the development of innovative strategies for early diagnosis and effective treatment of CRC metastasis. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based approach to track CRC-derived EVs in colon and lung models, enabling precise quantification of their uptake and trafficking in vitro. Moreover, we observed their tropism toward heterologous healthy cells in biologically relevant 3D models of colon and lung tissues, indicating the inherent role of CRC-EVs in metastatic niche formation and tumor initiation, raising their potential as innovative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets in CRC.",

This study investigated the association of CRF and muscle strength with several tumor-related phenotypes in an aggressive childhood malignancy, high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). Twelve mice bearing orthotopic HR-NB were studied. CRF and muscle strength were assessed using treadmill and grip strength testing, respectively. The following tumor-related outcomes were studied: survival, clinical severity, tumor weight/volume, metastasis, and intratumor immune infiltrates. Additionally, tumor samples underwent quantitative proteomic analysis via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Spearman correlations (or logistic regression) were performed between CRF/muscle strength and the abovementioned variables. Proteins significantly correlated with CRF or muscle strength were mapped into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. CRF was inversely correlated with clinical severity score (r = -0.657, p = 0.020). Of 6,840 identified tumor proteins, 76 correlated significantly with CRF (19 positively, 57 negatively), whereas 194 correlated with muscle strength (97 positively, 97 negatively). Proteins correlated with CRF were primarily involved in metabolic and structural pathways, including angiotensinogen and elastin. In turn, muscle strength-associated proteins were more abundant, and included keratin family proteins (e.g., keratin, type I cytoskeletal 14 and type II cytoskeletal 5), proteins involved in cell adhesion (e.g., desmoglein-1-alpha), and translational regulators (e.g., eukaryotic initiation factor 4A). Network analysis revealed significant enrichment in structural organization and cellular adhesion pathways. Besides the association of CRF with clinical severity of the tumor, distinct novel tumor proteomic signatures associated with CRF and muscle strength were identified, highlighting potential mechanisms linking physical fitness with childhood cancer biology.",

Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) is implicated in the development and progression of several types of cancer.

However, the molecular and functional mechanisms of KIFC1 in PC are not yet fully elaborated. In this study, KIFC1 and BUB1B were significantly upregulated in PC patient samples, and high KIFC1 expression was closely associated with the malignant phenotype and poorer overall survival (OS) in PC patients. Functional experiments showed that KIFC1 knockdown inhibited PC cell growth in vivo and in vitro, blocked cell cycle progression and hindered cell migration and invasion. In addition, rescue experiments showed that KIFC1 induced PC cell malignant behaviours dependent on BUB1B. Mechanistically, KIFC1 regulates BUB1B expression by competitively binding to BUB1B and reducing its ubiquitination and degradation. We have shown for the first time the molecular regulatory mechanism between KIFC1 and BUB1B on PC. Therefore, KIFC1 shows promise as an attractive therapeutic target for PC in the future.",

Although extensively studied in adults, information about the impact of germline variants in genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) remains scarce in the pediatric context. To elucidate whether (likely) pathogenic variants (LP/PVs) in 25 selected HBOC-related genes may contribute to cancer risk in children, we analyzed the spectrum of occurring germline variants. We assessed 372 children (median age at diagnosis 5.1 [0-22.2] years; 160 girls [43%]), including 212 (57%) with hematologic neoplasms, 71 (19%) with brain tumors, and 89 (24%) with various solid entities. Twenty-seven of 372 patients (7%) carried LP/PVs in the candidate genes; for 12 of 27 (44%) no CPS was suspected prior to genotyping. LP/PV carriers were particularly at risk for second malignancies (SMN; 5/27 vs. 13/345; OR = 5.8; p = .0021); yet, LP/PVs in SMN-developing patients resided exclusively in TP53 (n = 3), NBN (n = 1), and ATM (n = 1). Burden testing of our single-center cohort revealed considerable associations between monoallelic LP/PVs in five HBOC-related genes (TP53, CHEK2, ATM, NF1, and NBN) and pediatric cancers compared to healthy adults (gnomAD v.3.1.1, non-cancer dataset). Joint analyses adding 1120 individuals from a previous study Zhang et al. (2015) confirmed significant associations for TP53, CHEK2, NF1, and MSH2. Monoallelic LP/PVs in constrained HBOC-related genes are significantly associated with pediatric cancers.

    "abstract": "Ribophorin 1 (RPN1), a key component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, is implicated in tumor progression through glycosylation-mediated pathways, yet its pan-cancer roles remain unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of RPN1 across 33 cancers such as sarcoma (SARC), integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC. RPN1 was significantly overexpressed in 14 malignancies and correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM), lower-grade glioma, SARC and hepatocellular carcinoma, validated in an independent glioma cohort (n = 151). Genomically, RPN1 amplification linked to homologous recombination deficiency and elevated tumor mutational burden, suggesting a role in genomic instability. Critically, multiplex immunofluorescence demonstrates RPN1 overexpression colocalizes with CD206+ M2 macrophages in tumor microenvironments, while in vitro coculture experiments confirm RPN1-dependent microglial recruitment and M2 polarization. RPN1 expression negatively correlates with CD8+ T cell infiltration and predicts resistance to chemotherapy (GBM, ovarian cancer) and immunotherapy (GBM, esophageal carcinoma), though it associates with PD-1 inhibitor sensitivity in bladder cancer. Functional validation shows RPN1 knockdown suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion in GBM cells. Pathway enrichment connects RPN1 to endoplasmic reticulum stress, glycosylation, DNA repair, and immune checkpoint regulation. These findings position RPN1 as a multimodal oncogenic driver promoting genomic instability, immunosuppressive microenvironment remodeling, and context-dependent therapeutic vulnerabilities across cancers.",

    "abstract": "Human fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP-4), a protein elevated in obesity that promotes colon cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, may be associated with higher mortality in individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) and may serve as a mediator of the obesity-mortality association in these individuals. We used a causal diagram to inform covariate selection and applied Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for CRC-specific, non-CRC-specific, and all-cause mortality by FABP-4 levels measured in baseline blood samples from 1371 incident CRC cases from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Competing risk analyses were adapted for CRC and non-CRC deaths. Mediation analyses were conducted to estimate total effects (TEs), direct effects (DEs), and mediation proportions (MPs) by FABP-4 of pre-diagnostic body mass index (BMI) on mortality. In the fully adjusted model including BMI, higher circulating FABP-4 concentrations were associated with higher CRC mortality (HRQ4vsQ1 = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.11-2.00) and all-cause mortality (HRQ4vsQ1 = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.15-1.93), but not statistically associated with non-CRC mortality (HRQ4vsQ1 = 1.51; 95% CI: 0.82-2.76). The TE and DE per 5 kg/m2 of BMI on all-cause mortality were 1.21; 95% CI: 1.10-1.34, and 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.26, respectively, with a MP of 34.5% (p = .002) by FABP-4. For CRC-specific and non-CRC-specific mortality, MPs by FABP-4 were 33.7% (p = .03) and 36.1% (p = .02), respectively. In conclusion, higher concentrations of FABP-4 were associated with higher CRC-specific and all-cause mortality in individuals with CRC. FABP-4 was a significant partial mediator of the adiposity-mortality relationship in individuals with CRC.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is an extremely heterogeneous cancer and is highly prevalent in the older male population. Since intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) commonly results in PCa chemotherapy resistance and recurrence, it is critical to explore its effects on tumour behaviour. Prognostic genes related to ITH were identified, and a signature was constructed using Cox regression analyses and multiple machine learning algorithms. Single-cell RNA sequencing data extracted from PCa and CRPC samples were analysed via sub-clustering, pseudotime, cell communication and drug sensitivity approaches to elucidate their function. The oncogenic potential of hub genes was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and cell proliferation assays. An 11-gene signature underlying a prostate cancer meta-program (PCMP) was generated by selecting an optimal combination of machine learning methods. Survival assays and multivariate Cox regression analyses conducted in multiple cohorts revealed the superior prognostic value of the PCMP signature. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that it dysregulates the cell cycle. Using trajectory and cell-cell communication analyses, we illustrated that PCMP genes exert oncogenic effects by enhancing the proliferation and oxidative phosphorylation of epithelial cells. Intra-cellular assays also demonstrated that CENPA and CKS1B had promising malignant potential. In summary, our research not only establishes the association between the PCMP signature and reveals its malignant characteristics, but also deepens our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PCa progression and ITH. It holds promise for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions, thereby offering clinical benefits to patients.",

These biosensors leverage the unique molecular recognition properties of aptamers and the efficient electrochemical transduction mechanisms to detect various disease biomarkers, including those associated with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. A key advancement in this field is the integration of DNA aptamers with functional nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which significantly enhance sensor performance by improving electron transfer, signal amplification, and biocompatibility. This review comprehensively discusses the fundamental principles of electrochemical biosensors, recent advances in aptamer-based biosensing, and strategies for enhancing sensitivity and stability, particularly through signal amplification techniques and nanomaterial engineering. Furthermore, the challenges related to real-world applicability, including sample matrix effects, sensor miniaturization, and clinical validation, are critically examined. Finally, future perspectives on the development of portable, multiplexed, and point-of-care (POC) biosensors are provided, emphasizing their potential to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical diagnostics. The continuous evolution of AEBs, driven by innovations in nanotechnology and bioengineering, is expected to revolutionize disease diagnostics, facilitating early detection and personalized medicine.",

To assess self-reported work status, missed time at work (absenteeism), and performance (presenteeism) and their associations with QOL among young adult cancer survivors. This cross-sectional survey study was performed from October 18, 2020, to September 17, 2022, at a single cancer center in Seattle, Washington. Participants included young adult cancer survivors (aged 18 to 39 years at diagnosis) who were 1 year or more from completion of cancer therapy. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2023, to February 1, 2025. Cancer therapy. Unemployment rate compared with the age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched general population; standardized absolute and relative absenteeism and presenteeism scores; standardized scores for domains of anxiety, depression, physical function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, social role, and cognition; and adjusted linear regressions to study factors associated with higher QOL scores. A total of 198 survivors, with a median age at diagnosis of 31 (IQR, 26-35) years and a median age at survey of 39 (IQR, 35-44) years were included (142 [71.7%] female). The unemployment rate (14 [7.1%]) did not differ from that of the general population (4.7%) (P = .13). Compared with employed survivors, unemployed survivors reported significantly higher depression scores (coefficient, 5.11; 95% CI, 0.92-9.30) and lower scores for satisfaction with social roles and activities (coefficient, -6.59; 95% CI, -11.34 to -1.84) and physical function (coefficient, -6.63; 95% CI, -11.38 to -1.87). Higher absolute presenteeism score was associated with lower scores for anxiety (coefficient, -0.19; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.11), depression (coefficient, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.10), fatigue (coefficient, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.10), pain interference (coefficient, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.02), and sleep disturbance (coefficient, -0.12; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.03) and higher scores for physical function (coefficient, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.008-0.17), cognitive function (coefficient, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.11-0.27), and satisfaction in social roles and activities scores (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24). Additionally, a higher absolute absenteeism score was associated with a higher anxiety (coefficient, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.004-0.07) and lower cognitive function (coefficient, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.004). In this cross-sectional study of young adult cancer survivors, associations were found between survivors' self-reported work status and performance and their QOL affecting their mental, physical, and social health. These findings call for the development of effective communication strategies with employers to balance work expectations with survivors' treatment-related complications to achieve better performance and in turn higher QOL.",

Moreover, MCOLN1 has already been proven to be a crucial regulator of autophagy. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms by which MCOLN1 mediates autophagy in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. The expression of MCOLN1 in LC cells and its influence on prognosis were analyzed. The effect of MCOLN1 on cell migration and invasion was analyzed using a scratch test and Transwell assay. The level of autophagy was reflected by evaluating the levels of autophagy marker proteins LC3 and p62 and the changes in autophagy flux. Through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), signaling pathways enriched by MCOLN1 were discovered. The levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related genes and marker proteins were detected to assess the ERS state. An LC xenograft tumor model was constructed to verify the effect of MCOLN1 on tumor growth and autophagy in vivo. MCOLN1 was greatly upregulated in LC cells, which was linked with poor prognosis. Functionally, MCOLN1 boosted LC cells to migrate and invade, which was achieved by inducing autophagy. Further analysis demonstrated that MCOLN1 was enriched in the ERS pathway, and knockdown of MCOLN1 could reduce LC migration and invasion by repressing ERS and blocking cell autophagy, while the addition of the ERS inducer NiCl2 reversed the effect of MCOLN1 knockdown. Moreover, in vivo experiments confirmed that MCOLN1 can mediate ERS-induced autophagy to boost LC growth. MCOLN1 plays a carcinogenic role in LC migration and invasion by regulating ERS-induced autophagy. Repressing the MCOLN1/ERS/autophagy axis is likely to be a potential therapeutic strategy for LC.",

Since taller stature is associated with increased cancer risk and men are, on average, taller than women, we investigated to what extent adult body height, as a proxy for stem cell number, explains the elevated cancer risk in men. This population-based cohort study linked adult height information from Swedish conscripts, mothers, and passports to the National Cancer and Cause of Death Registers (1960-2011). We used mediation survival analysis to estimate the proportion of the association between male sex and site-specific cancer risk mediated by adult height, our main outcome. Statistical significance was assessed using two-sided tests with a .05 significance level. Among 6,156,659 adults, we observed 285,778 non-sex-specific cancer cases. Male sex was significantly associated with cancer risk at 33 of 39 sites, and greater height with increased risk at 27 of 39 sites. Height mediated 0.5%-100% of the excess male cancer risk, with the highest proportions for salivary gland cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. The effects of height and its mediated effect were most consistent for malignancies with weak or no established environmental risk factors. These findings indicate that a substantial proportion of the excess cancer risk in men may be explained by height. This highlights the role of stochastic biological processes linked to height, as well as genetic and early-life determinants of height, in contributing to sex differences in cancer risk, beyond influences of adult lifestyle and environmental exposures.",

    "abstract": "Time toxicity in breast cancer refers to the time burden patients face from treatments, hospital visits, and managing side effects. As survival improves, attention has shifted to the impact of time spent on care. For those receiving long-term endocrine therapy, visiting hospital and waiting time for clinic affect their daily life. Thus, reducing time toxicity is essential to improve quality of life alongside survival outcomes. This study surveyed postoperative breast cancer patients requiring hormonal therapy, who attended Yokohama City University Hospital from August 2023 to July 2024, using a digital self-administered survey to assess prescription refills. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the original questionnaire were used to compare changes in status of patients before and after the introduction of prescription refills. A comparison of outpatient visits before and after prescription refills revealed a decreasing trend in visit frequency. Patient satisfaction showed a significant improvement, with patients giving higher ratings after prescription refills were introduced. The proportion of patients experiencing shorter waits increased, with 49% reporting a reduction in waiting times. Anxiety about extended visit intervals decreased, with only 1% of patients reporting increased anxiety. Notably, patient satisfaction with prescription refills remained high across various postoperative durations and age groups. Approximately 70% of patients expressed a desire to continue using prescription refills, indicating overall positive reception regardless of age or postoperative period. The introduction of prescription refills led to a reduction in outpatient visits and improvements in patient satisfaction and perceived waiting times. Prescription refills, recently introduced in Japan, are not yet widely recognized but may become a valuable tool for breast cancer patients and healthcare providers. Further research is required to assess the impact of the prescription refills on patient outcomes.",

This study evaluated the impact of a novel interdisciplinary workshop introducing oncology and cancer rehabilitation, designed specifically to address the persistent educational and workforce disparities faced by URiM students. A half-day, in-person workshop was conducted in April 2025 at a medical school in New York City. The curriculum included lectures, case-based learning, a procedural suturing session, and a mentorship panel. Pre- and post-workshop surveys assessed self-reported knowledge and confidence in oncology, cancer rehabilitation, and clinical skills.

This study evaluates the implementation and impact of a 3-month oncology enrichment elective designed to address these educational gaps. From 2021 to 2024, we offered an oncology enrichment elective to medical students at a single institution. The curriculum included multidisciplinary didactic sessions and facility tours covering various oncology specialties.

Students reported high satisfaction with the curriculum and its clinical relevance. The elective significantly enhanced exposure to underrepresented areas in oncology education, particularly radiation oncology and palliative care. Over two-thirds of respondents indicated the elective influenced their residency choice, with a similar proportion expressing interest in oncology careers. Thematic analysis revealed that students valued personalized faculty insights and requested more interactive learning experiences. An oncology enrichment elective effectively addresses gaps in cancer education during medical school, particularly during condensed pre-clerkship curricula. The model demonstrates potential for improving student comfort with oncology concepts and enhancing multidisciplinary understanding of cancer care.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women worldwide. Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is commonly used for treatment, but its clinical application is often constrained by hematologic toxicity, particularly severe bone marrow suppression. The early identification of high-risk patients is essential to prevent complications and optimize therapeutic outcomes. Machine learning offers advanced capabilities for risk prediction by capturing complex patterns beyond those of traditional statistical models. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with bone marrow suppression in breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, and to develop and validate predictive models using machine learning algorithms. This retrospective case-control study included 119 patients with breast cancer treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy at the Hainan Hospital of Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, from January 2020 to December 2024. Patients were divided into bone marrow suppression (n = 57; WHO grades II-IV) and non-suppression (n = 62; grades 0-I) groups based on WHO toxicity criteria. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors. Three prediction models, logistic regression, random forest, and AdaBoost, were constructed and evaluated. A five-fold cross-validation with 50 repetitions was performed to ensure model stability and reliability. Multivariate analysis revealed that a low baseline lymphocyte count (OR = 4.95, 95% CI 1.62-17.0), decreased white blood cell (WBC) count (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.9), and reduced prealbumin level (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) were significantly associated with severe bone marrow suppression (all p < 0.05). Among the models, AdaBoost achieved the best overall performance (AUC = 0.81; specificity = 94%; accuracy = 77%). The random forest model showed the highest sensitivity (83%), while logistic regression was more interpretable but demonstrated a lower predictive ability (AUC = 0.69). Pretreatment lymphocyte count, WBC count, and prealbumin level are reliable predictors of docetaxel-induced bone marrow suppression. The AdaBoost model demonstrates high specificity (94%) in identifying low-risk patients, supporting accurate risk stratification and personalized care in breast cancer treatment.",

However, the internal mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore whether PRDM14 modulates NSCLS cell growth and metastasis via H3K27me3-mediated phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling. PRDM14 overexpression plasmid (OE-PRDM14), siRNA targeting PRDM14 (si-PRDM14) or si-jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (si-JMJD3) were transfected to alter PRDM14 or JMJD3 expressions. Vemurafenib (VMF) was utilized to inhibit Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling. Cell proliferation was tested via Edu staining and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated through two-chamber transwell assay. The protein levels of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and PEBP1/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling were measured via western blotting. qPCR was used to test mRNA expressions of PEBP1, c-Fos, c-Jun and c-Myc. OE-PRDM14 promoted A549 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, elevated PRC2 and H3K27me3 expressions, lowered PEBP1 expression and activated Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling. si-PRDM14 had contrary influences. VMF weakened the influences of OE-PRDM14 on A549 cell functions and Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling, but had no significant effects on PEBP1 and H3K27me3 levels. si-JMJD3 accelerated the influences of PRDM14 overexpression on A549 cell functions, PEBP1 and H3K27me3 expressions, as well as Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling. PRDM14 promoted NSCLC proliferation, migration and invasion via modulating PRC2/H3K27me3-mediated PEBP1/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling activation. PRDM14 might be as a new target in NSCLC therapy.",

Recent advances have uncovered the critical influence of the human microbiota-complex communities of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms-on lung cancer pathogenesis and therapeutic responses. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the compositional and functional roles of microbiota across multiple body sites, including the gut, lung, tumor microenvironment, circulation, and oral cavity, highlighting their contributions to tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and immune regulation. We emphasize the bidirectional communication between microbial metabolites and host immune pathways, particularly the gut-lung axis, which modulates systemic and local antitumor immunity. Importantly, microbiota composition has been linked to differential responses and toxicities in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade. Microbiota-targeted interventions, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and selective antibiotics, show promising potential to enhance treatment efficacy and mitigate adverse effects. However, challenges remain in clinical translation due to interindividual microbiome variability, mechanistic complexities, and limited longitudinal data. Future research integrating multi-omics, microbial functional profiling, and controlled clinical trials is essential to harness the microbiome as a precision medicine tool in lung cancer management.

This study investigated the function of m6A modification in macrophages and demonstrated that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) can downregulate the alternatively activated macrophages (M2) polarization level of TAMs via suppression of snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (Snail) protein translation. Independent of protein stability, METTL3 restrained the translation efficiency of Snail in an m6A-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting M2 polarization of TAMs. The m6A binding protein insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) recognized the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) m6A modification site of Snail and regulated the translation of Snail through its influence on the binding of eukaryotic translation release factor 1 (eRF1) and eukaryotic translation release factor 3 (eRF3) to Snail mRNA. Targeted specific demethylation of Snail m6A by the dm6ACRISPR system can significantly increase the protein expression of Snail and M2 polarization of TAMs. In a mouse xenograft model, knocking down the expression of METTL3 in macrophages significantly promoted tumor growth. Meanwhile, database analyses indicated the level of m6A in macrophages was inversely proportional to the degree of macrophage infiltration in tumors. Collectively, m6A suppressed M2 polarization of TAMs via Snail protein translation, which attenuated cancer cell growth and cancer development.",

However, the precise origin and clinical relevance of cfDNA in these disorders remain to be fully clarified. In this study, we analyzed plasma samples from 98 patients with hematologic malignancies and 80 healthy donors using quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify cfDNA concentrations. We further examined associations between cfDNA levels and clinical parameters, including sex and measurable residual disease (MRD). Our results demonstrated significantly elevated cfDNA levels in patients compared to healthy individuals, with a strong correlation between cfDNA concentration and presence/MRD of the disease. We also identified sex-specific differences in cfDNA levels. Notably, our findings suggest that neutrophils, through the release and degradation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), may constitute a relevant source of circulating cfDNA. In addition, cfDNA concentrations were significantly associated with MRD status, supporting the potential role of cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker for disease monitoring. Overall, our data highlight the clinical relevance of cfDNA in hematologic malignancies, both as a surrogate for disease burden and as a possible player in disease pathophysiology, thus offering a promising avenue for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

Future research should focus on improving AI interpretability, fostering multi-centre dataset interoperability, and integrating AI with molecular imaging and real-time clinical decision support. Addressing these challenges will ensure AI's seamless integration into clinical oncology, optimising cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes.",

    "title": "Talazoparib and radiation enhance the senolytic efficacy of venetoclax in therapy-induced senescent triple-negative breast cancer cells.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents ongoing clinical challenges, often leading to relapse in many patients. The relapse is partly explained by tumor cells transitioning into a senescent state following chemotherapy or radiation, resulting in a more aggressive phenotype, contributing to disease recurrence. Consequently, combining senolytics with traditional treatments could be a viable and promising strategy in treating TNBC. To address this, we induced therapy-induced senescence (TIS) both in vitro and in vivo by combining the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor talazoparib with radiation. We tested whether exposure to the senolytic agent, venetoclax, would result in the eradication of senescent cells and augmentation of apoptosis. TIS Markers, like senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), CDKN1A, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) marker IL-6, were altered following talazoparib and radiation in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines. Interestingly, venetoclax treatment following TIS induction led to pronounced apoptotic cell death and significant changes in SA-β-gal and IL-6, implying enhanced sensitivity post-senescence induction. Furthermore, these data were validated in vivo in an immunocompetent TNBC-bearing mouse model, in which venetoclax alone had a modest effect on growth inhibition. However, when combined with radiotherapy/talazoparib, venetoclax dramatically interfered with tumor recovery post-senescence induction, indicating a potential strategy to mitigate disease recurrence. These results suggest that combining radiotherapy with PARP inhibitors with senolytic agents such as venetoclax could potentially overcome disease relapse associated with TNBC.",

    "abstract": "While the applications of neoadjuvant therapies on patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tumor thrombus (TT) is growing, the safety of preoperative therapies has yet to be clarified. 451 patients diagnosed with RCC with TT undergoing radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy were included. Propensity score-matched cohorts were used to investigate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant therapies. We compared perioperative parameters and postoperative complications. Postoperative complications were assessed within 30 days of the operation and were graded using the Clavien-Dindo grading system. A Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the impact of neoadjuvant therapies on patients' overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). After 1:3 ratio propensity-score matching (PSM), 56 patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy and 153 patients receiving non-neoadjuvant therapy were included in the analysis. No significant difference was found between the two groups after PSM in terms of baseline information (P > 0.05). The rate of blood transfusion (71.4% vs. 52.3%, P = 0.01) was higher in neoadjuvant therapy. 8 patients (14.3%) in neoadjuvant therapy group experienced serious complications while 15 patients (14.9%) in non-neoadjuvant therapy group experienced serious complications. The perioperative parameters and postoperative complications did not show significant differences in preoperative-combined therapy group and non-preoperative-combined therapy group. No significant differences were found in OS or CSS between the neoadjuvant therapy group and non-neoadjuvant therapy group. Neoadjuvant therapies can be safely administered to RCC patients with TT. Neoadjuvant therapies recipients' OS or CSS did not differ significantly from those who did not receive the treatment.",

    "abstract": "Given the pivotal role of CDK4/6 deregulation in the pathogenesis of various malignancies, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been incorporated into cancer treatment protocols. Beyond their antiproliferative effects, these inhibitors exhibit prominent immunomodulatory properties. Preclinical data indicated that CDK4/6 inhibitors enhance the tumor cell antigen presentation capacity and restrict the proliferation of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells. Furthermore, studies showed that CDK4/6 inhibitors could enhance the development of memory T-cell in vivo in melanoma mouse models and in the clinical setting in breast cancer (BC) patients. In silico analysis identified 225 protein targets for CDK4/6 inhibitors involved in 57 immune-related pathways which further supported the immune-modulatory potential of these inhibitors in innate immunity, cytokine signaling, and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, 24 targets exhibited significantly higher protein expression in immune cell types compared to non-immune cell types, as indicated by data from the Human Protein Atlas. The favorable modulation of T-cell immunity by CDK4/6 inhibitors could complement the antitumor effect of immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which hamper PD-1 /PD-L1 signaling and result in the reactivation of the antitumor T-cell response. Herein, we explore the clinical portfolio of CDK4/6 inhibitors across various solid malignancies, with emphasis on emerging combinations with ICIs.",

Despite advancements in systemic therapies, including the use of lenvatinib, the survival rate for advanced HCC remains low due to drug resistance and tumor heterogeneity. This study employed single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to investigate intra-tumor heterogeneity and identify subpopulations of malignant cells with inherent drug resistance. Tumor samples were obtained from patients undergoing lenvatinib, and differential analysis was performed to identify biomarkers associated with drug resistance. Analysis revealed significant differences in treatment response between different HCC nodules within the same patient, indicating intra-tumor heterogeneity. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics identified distinct cell clusters within tumors, with specific subpopulations showing inherent resistance to lenvatinib. Differential analysis identified 17 common upregulated genes, including PCK1 and ALDH1A1, which were significantly associated with drug resistance. Pseudotime analysis further supported the role of PCK1 and ALDH1A1 as potential biomarkers of inherent drug resistance in HCC. This study highlights the importance of tumor heterogeneity and identifying biomarkers associated with drug resistance in HCC. The findings suggest that PCK1 and ALDH1A1 may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response and guiding therapeutic strategies in HCC patients.",

    "abstract": "The precise differentiation of recurrent glioma from treatment-related changes, such as pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis, is essential for treatment planning and remains a significant challenge. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts can be targeted with PET tracers for in vivo visualization and quantification. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic effectiveness of FAP expression in patients with potential recurrent glioma by directly comparing [gallium-68] FAP inhibitor-04 and [fluorine-18] fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine PET/CT imaging. Thirty glioma patients showing signs of possible recurrence during routine MRI follow-up after treatment were enrolled. PET-based semiquantitative parameters, clinical factors, and survival data were collected for analysis. Paired comparison of SUVmax, TBRmax, MTV, and TLU originating from two PET imaging studies indicated significant differences in TBRmax, MTV, and TLU, with P values of 0.000, 0.001, and 0.000, respectively. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a marginally non-significant difference in efficacy (P = 0.053) of the initial pathological diagnosis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PET parameters, initial pathological data, age, and gender were used to develop the predictive models step by step. Although trends towards significance were observed in the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio, no PET parameters reached statistical significance. The MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). When PET parameters and initial pathological diagnosis were included, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio significantly enhanced the model's AUC (P = 0.040) from 0.709 (0.465-0.953, 95% CI) to 0.847 (0.688-1.000, 95% CI). When replacing the initial diagnosis with initial WHO grade, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio improved the AUC (P = 0.016) from 0.640 (0.400-0.880, 95% CI) to 0.852 (0.715-0.988, 95% CI). After factoring in age and gender in addition to the initial pathological diagnosis, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio enhanced the AUC (P = 0.039) from 0.841 (0.677-1.000, 95% CI) to 0.963 (0.887-1.000, 95% CI). Similarly, after replacing the initial pathological diagnosis with the initial WHO grade, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio significantly enhanced the AUC of the model (P = 0.046) from 0.762 (0.532-0.992, 95% CI) to 0.942 (0.850-1.000, 95% CI). The survival analysis revealed that the MTV-FAPI of the lesion has a significant impact on overall survival (P = 0.027, hazard ratio = 1.103, 95% CI: 1.011-1.204). This head-to-head exploratory study showed that glioma FAP expression volume is an independent risk factor that can significantly influence overall survival in patients with recurrent glioma. Although statistically insignificant, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio, which represents the FAP expression volume percentage of the post-treatment glioma tissue, suggests trends toward significant differentiation between glioma recurrence and treatment-related changes.",

    "abstract": "To estimate mortality trends and disease burden of Digestive system cancer (DSC) in China during 2006-2020, using demographic and mortality data from cause-of-death surveillance dataset of China. Joinpoint regression was applied to calculate the crude mortality rate (CMR), age standardized mortality rate (ASMR), annual percentage change (APC), and average annual percentage change (AAPC) for analyzing the trend of death change, and years of life expectancy lost (LLE) and early death lost life (YLL) were utilized to assess disease burden. Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort models were employed to project future mortality trends up to 2045. From 2006 to 2020, the combined ASMR and YLL rates for female DSC showed stability, with an average life expectancy loss of 7.06 years and the highest YLL rate in the 60-65 age group. Esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer showed a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2020, with APCs of -4.59% (P = 0.001), -5.25% (P = 0.002), and - 3.74% (P = 0.002), respectively. Colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer showed an upward trend in 2016-2020, with APC of 1.85% (P = 0.021) and 2.74% (P = 0.023), respectively. The trend of standardized YLL rate changes was statistically significant (AAPC = - 2.8%, 95% CI: - 3.3%, 2.3%).

    "abstract": "Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired antibody production and recurrent infections. In this study we investigated the clinical and immunological features of CVID in Indian patients and develops a machine learning model for predicting disease severity. We retrospectively analyzed 150 patients diagnosed with CVID over a decade at a tertiary care center in India. The median age of diagnosis was 18 years, with a male predominance (62%). The majority of patients (66.6%) had a severe phenotype, with recurrent respiratory tract infections being the most common clinical manifestation (84.2%). Gastrointestinal complications were observed in 45% of patients, while autoimmune manifestations were seen in 21%. All patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia. IgA levels varied, with 7.8% normal and 14.5% undetectable. IgM levels were decreased in 85.5% of patients. B-cell analysis revealed 64.4% had reduced class-switched memory B cells, with 21.7% showing very low levels. Nine adult patients presented with late-onset combined immunodeficiency. Genetic testing, performed on 52 patients, identified underlying monogenic causes in 29 pediatric and 15 adult patients. LRBA deficiency was the most common genetic defect, found in seven pediatric and three adult patients. We developed a novel machine learning-based severity prediction model for CVID patients, utilizing readily available lymphocyte subsets, class-switched memory B cell counts, and serum immunoglobulin levels to provide an accessible and robust tool for predicting disease severity using Ameratunga's clinical severity score. Random Forest outperformed other models across all metrics, achieving an accuracy of 0.853 (95% CI: 0.840-0.866). Feature importance analysis across all models identified Th-Tc ratio, CD19, and IgM levels as the most influential predictors for severity prediction. Our study highlights the diverse clinical and immunological features of CVID in Indian patients, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and individualized management strategies. The machine learning model developed using commonly available immune parameters provide a robust tool for predicting disease severity, potentially guiding treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A novel electrochemical sensor based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with a NiCaAl layered double hydroxide with carboxyl-functionalized nanodiamonds (NiCaAl-LDH@ND-COOH) was developed for the first time to enable sensitive and selective detection of larotrectinib (LARO), the first selective pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor used clinically for cancer treatment. The nanocomposite was synthesized by integrating NiCaAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) with carboxyl-functionalized nanodiamonds (ND-COOH), resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The individual electrochemical properties of ND-COOH and NiCaAl-LDH were systematically evaluated and compared with those of the combined nanocomposite. ND-COOH contributed high surface area, low background current, and improved conductivity, while NiCaAl-LDH offered abundant redox-active sites and high ion-exchange capacity. The NiCaAl-LDH@ND-COOH nanocomposite exhibited a synergistic enhancement in electron transfer kinetics and surface activity, as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and impedance studies. Under optimized conditions, the sensor displayed a wide linear detection range (1.0 to 16.37 µM) and a low detection limit of 4.36 nM. It also demonstrated excellent repeatability (RSD = 1.3%), reproducibility (RSD = 1.23%), and high selectivity against common interferents. Successful application to pharmaceutical formulations, serum, and urine samples confirmed its practicality, achieving recoveries between 96.7% and 102.6%. This work provides the first electrochemical sensing platform for LARO, offering a reliable and cost-effective tool for its monitoring in clinical and pharmaceutical settings.",

    "abstract": "Among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including TC. The role of PICSAR lncRNA (LINC00162) has been validated in different human cancers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncRNA PICSAR in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. This comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of PICSAR in thyroid cancer. This work assessed the expression of the long non-coding RNA LINC00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Interactions among LINC00162, hsa-miR-320A, hsa-miR-485, and RAPGEFL1 were investigated using the LncACT and miRDB databases. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment analysis to clarify the relevant molecular pathways. For the investigation of LINC00162 expression in TC samples, 50 matched samples of thyroid carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue were gathered. Real time PCR was used to objectively evaluate the expression levels of the targeted genes. Every tissue sample was examined pathologically. A specific siRNA was transfected into a thyroid cancer cell line to examine the functional role of LINC00162. The impact of LINC00162 silencing was then assessed by measuring the level of target genes expression following the transfection. Based on TCGA-THCA analysis and qRT-PCR on tissue samples, LINC00162 (PICSAR) was markedly overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues compared to normal samples. However, no discernible correlation was found between LINC00162 expression and the pathological characteristics of thyroid cancer. Our bioinformatics predictions based on lncRNA-microRNA interactions demonstrate that LINC00162 acts as a molecular sponge for the downregulated microRNAs hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485 in thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1, a gene associated with the development of thyroid cancer, is upregulated in conjunction with this downregulation. The LINC00162-miRNA-RAPGEFL1 axis is involved in critical carcinogenic processes, including thiamine metabolism, cell cycle control, and folate biosynthesis, according to functional enrichment analysis. Additionally, a bioinformatics study revealed a negative association between PICSAR and the NUDT3 gene, while a positive correlation was found with the SNX18P14 gene. Thyroid cancer cells transfected with LINC00162-specific siRNA showed significant downregulation of LINC00162 and RAPGEFL1, alongside an increase in hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, ultimately inhibiting the growth of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that targeting PICSAR may offer a treatment strategy for thyroid cancer by altering important biological processes. In conclusion, LINC00162, which is overexpressed in thyroid cancer, acts as a molecular sponge for hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, regulating key oncogenic pathways and leading to the upregulation of RAPGEFL1. These effects are reversed upon siRNA-mediated silencing of LINC00162, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1 regulates the Rap signaling pathway, controlling adhesion, migration, polarity, and metabolism to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis. Its dysregulation is linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

Four cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models were developed using representative ccRCC cell lines harboring common mutations. Tumors were subcutaneously implanted into the right flank of BALB/c nude mice. Mice were treated with vehicle or JX-594 via intratumoral injection on days 0, 3, and 6, and tumor growth was evaluated. Therapeutic efficacies of JX-594 and a STING agonist were compared in the BAP1-mutant (769-P) CDX model. All four CDX models showed significant tumor shrinkage following JX-594 treatment versus control. JX-594 exhibited greater efficacy than the STING agonist in BAP1-deficient xenografts. The BAP1 mutation was associated with rapid tumor progression and a stronger response to JX-594. JX-594 induced IFN-β expression through IRF7-dependent signaling in BAP1-deficient cells, bypassing impaired STING-IRF3 signaling. We identified BAP1 as a potential predictive biomarker for JX-594 treatment and explored its underlying mechanisms.

Based on the treatment regimen, patients were divided into two groups: the dual-therapy group, which received TACE combined with either lenvatinib or bevacizumab, and the triple-therapy group, which additionally received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Survival outcomes and prognostic factors were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models. The triple-therapy group demonstrated significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to the dual-therapy group (PFS: HR = 0.450, P = 0.048; OS: HR = 0.437, P = 0.039). Multivariate Cox analysis identified triple therapy, lower tumour burden, and higher pathological response as favourable prognostic factors, whereas vascular invasion and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were linked to poorer outcomes. Additionally, in this Chinese HCC cohort, the China Liver Cancer (CNLC) staging system appeared to provide superior prognostic stratification compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. In the context of NAT for HCC, triple therapy-combining TACE, targeted agents, and immunotherapy-appears to be a more effective treatment option compared to dual therapy.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for staging patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I endometrial cancer, by comparing the original 2009 system with the revised 2023 system. This retrospective study included 432 patients (mean age, 54.9 years) with histopathologically confirmed FIGO 2009 stage I endometrial cancer who underwent preoperative MRI. The patients were categorized into non-aggressive (n = 364; low-grade endometrioid histology) and aggressive (n = 68; grade 3 endometrioid or non-endometrioid histology, including serous, clear cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma) tumor groups. Preoperative MRI-based assessment of myometrial invasion was compared with histopathological results to assess the myometrial invasion depth, which was classified as no invasion, superficial invasion (< 50%), and deep invasion (≥ 50%). Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and agreement of preoperative MRI-based staging determination were calculated for both FIGO 2009 and 2023 systems. In non-aggressive tumors, the 2009 FIGO staging demonstrated superior accuracy (kappa 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.89) compared to the 2023 staging (kappa 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74), with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0029). MRI performance varied across invasion depths, with excellent diagnostic accuracy for deep myometrial invasion (sensitivity, 87.0%; specificity, 95.9%). For aggressive tumors, no significant difference was observed between the two staging systems (p = 0.160). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the presence of lymphovascular space invasion did not result in statistically significant differences in diagnostic agreement between MRI and pathological staging (p = 0.452). This study provides evidence that 2023 FIGO staging revisions present measurable challenges for MRI-based staging accuracy, particularly in the assessment of non-aggressive endometrial tumors confined to the uterus. Despite these challenges, MRI maintains reliable diagnostic performance for detecting deep myometrial invasion in uterus-confined disease, supporting its continued utility in preoperative staging protocols. KEY TAKE‑HOME: Radiologists should recognize the statistically significant reduction in diagnostic accuracy for detecting the absence of myometrial invasion under FIGO 2023 criteria, particularly in non-aggressive endometrioid tumors, and consider integrating complementary quantitative imaging parameters or molecular biomarkers to enhance the preoperative staging precision.",

    "abstract": "Determine whether staged right colectomy for appendiceal cancer (initial appendectomy followed by completion colectomy - SRC) is detrimental to oncologic outcomes compared to upfront right colectomy (URC). The decision to perform right hemicolectomy for appendiceal cancer depends on histologic features of the primary tumor. SRC allows for histologic assessment of primary tumor and may avoid an unnecessary right colectomy if not indicated. Stage I-III appendiceal cancer patients undergoing resection from 2000-2019 in California. Tumor histologies for which consensus guidelines recommend right hemicolectomy were included. Matched analysis was performed using 'Entropy Balancing' to compare overall survival (OS). A total of 908 patients (median age 58 years; 46% female) were included of which 239 (26%) underwent appendectomy alone and 669 (74%) underwent colectomy. Of these 669 patients, 349 (52%) underwent URC, whereas 320 (48%) underwent SRC. URC (vs. SRC) was more likely to be performed for larger tumors (size >5 cm; 17% vs. 10%), high-grade disease (13% vs. 9%), and higher stage (Stage III; 10% vs. 5%) (all P<0.001). Expectedly, patients undergoing URC (vs. SRC) had worse OS (ref: SRC; Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.13; P<0.001) on univariable analysis. A subset survival analysis of elective cases with entropy balancing demonstrated that patients undergoing SRC had comparable survival to patients undergoing URC. After adjusting for covariates, compared to URC, a staged approach is not detrimental to oncologic outcomes. Therefore, when possible, a staged approach should be prioritized, as it may prevent unnecessary right colectomy in many patients.",

Although cfDNA may act as a danger signal by binding to DNA sensors, triggering inflammation and immune responses, elevated cfDNA concentrations instead may exert immunoregulatory activities. Here, we show that exogenously administered cfDNA mediates immunoregulatory functions in vivo, in particular, it protects lupus-prone mice from disease progression and favors tumor growth in tumor-challenged mice. Our data suggest that cfDNA mediates immune regulatory activities by directly interacting with MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and through recruitment of regulatory T cells. This study unveils unprecedented biologic functions of cfDNA with significant pathogenic relevance and remarkable implications for the treatment of cancer patients.",

Population-based, cross-sectional study of healthy beneficiaries of cancer insurance at a private cancer center, both sexes, between 40 and 75 years of age during 2021. Data were collected via REDCap® and analyzed in a descriptive and inferential manner, using R v4.04. 2,091 healthy beneficiaries responded to the survey with a gender distribution of 68% women and 32% men. 64% of the participants had a direct family member with a history of some type of cancer, the most prevalent BMI was the overweight range with a frecuency of 46%, 55% performed physical activity at least 1 time/ week and 19% were active smokers. Of the breast cancer survey (n=851), 66% reported having a family history of cancer ok any kind, and 91% had used some form of contraception, 23.6% had a family history of breast cancer, and 9.3% had a family history of ovarian cancer.

A total of 165 patients with CP (27 early-stage, 40 compensated-stage, 61 transitional-stage, and 37 decompensated-stage) were enrolled. Plasma concentrations of apoA2-AT and apoA2-ATQ isoforms were measured. The apoA2-i index was calculated as √(ATQ×AT), and an index <59.5 µg/mL was considered positive. ApoA2 processing type was classified as hyper-processing (AT>ATQ) or hypo-processing (AT<ATQ). We assessed the association of the apoA2-i index and apoA2 processing type with clinical characteristics and imaging findings. The apoA2-i index was positive in 86 patients (52.1%), including 33 (38.4%) with the hyper-processing type and 53 (61.6%) with the hypo-processing type. As CP progressed, the proportion of patients with a positive apoA2-i index increased, and the processing type shifted from hyper-processing to hypo-processing. Patients with a positive apoA2-i index had longer disease duration, more advanced disease stages, higher Controlling Nutritional Status scores, and lower serum lipase levels, suggesting worse nutritional status and impaired pancreatic exocrine function. On CT, these patients exhibited thinner pancreatic parenchyma and greater main pancreatic duct dilation. A positive apoA2-i index was associated with CP progression. Further studies are warranted to determine whether it could serve as a surrogate marker for pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Cayratia japonica is a traditional Chinese herbal plant rich in flavonoid compounds, with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Although Cayratia japonica has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries, the mechanisms underlying flavonoid biosynthesis in this plant remain largely unexplored. In this study, combining transcriptomics and bioinformatics, we constructed a transcriptome database for three tissues of Cayratia japonica. We identified 38 unigenes related to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the expression levels of three key enzyme-encoding genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase gene (DN990) and two chalcone isomerase genes (DN1381, DN2421)) were significantly and positively correlated with the total flavonoid content. Subsequently, the tertiary structures of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and chalcone isomerases were constructed, and structure-based docking analysis was carried o ut. The expression levels of 16 key enzyme genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were verified using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Four MYB transcription factors involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were also identified. In addition, five potentially important therapeutic targets for Ulcerative colitis were predicted through network pharmacological analysis. This study provides references for understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of key enzyme-encoding genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, as well as a scientific basis for the further development of the medicinal potential of Cayratia japonica.",

AI can also boost imaging capabilities through individual risk prediction, molecular subtyping, and neoadjuvant therapy response predictions. Evidence demonstrates AI's potential across multiple modalities. The most robust data come from mammographic screening, where AI models improve diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflow, but rigorous post-market surveillance is required before any implementation strategy in this field. Commercial tools for digital breast tomosynthesis and ultrasound, potentially able to reduce interpretation time and improve accuracy, are also available, but post-implementation evaluation studies are likewise lacking. Besides basic tools for breast MRI with limited proven clinical benefit, AI applications for other modalities are not yet commercially available. Applications in contrast-enhanced mammography are still in the research stage, especially for radiomics-based molecular subtype classification. Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are in their infancy, and there are currently no clinical applications. Consequently, and despite their promise, all commercially available AI tools for breast imaging should currently still be regarded as techniques that, at best, aid radiologists in image evaluation. Their use is therefore optional, and the findings may always be overruled.

This retrospective, single-center study included patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent TNT followed by surgery or non-operative management (NOM) from January 2018-December 2019. Two abdominal radiologists independently scored baseline and restaging MRIs for mucin quantity in the tumor or tumor bed, using two classifications: < 50% vs. ≥ 50% (similar to histological classification) and no mucin vs. any mucin. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if patient outcomes differed between tumors of different mucin quantities. Among 189 patients, 114/189 (60%) male, 75/189 (40%) female), the median age at diagnosis was 57 years (IQR: 48-68). On baseline MRI, 29/189 (15%) patients had tumor containing any amount of mucin, and on restaging MRI, 27/189 (14%) patients had tumor containing any mucin. 103/189 (54%) underwent surgery after TNT, and 86/189 (46%) underwent NOM. 59/189 (31%) experienced local recurrence, distant recurrence, or local regrowth. There were no significant differences in the rate of pathologic complete response/sustained clinical complete response, time to local recurrence/local regrowth, time to distant recurrence, and disease-free survival between tumors of different mucin quantity, regardless of the timing and criteria for determining mucin quantity (< 50% vs. ≥ 50% mucin criteria, and no vs. any mucin criteria on baseline MRI, restaging MRI and on histopathology, respectively). Mucin on restaging MRI should not rule out NOM or prompt more aggressive therapy in the absence of other high-risk features. Question Is there a correlation in mucin content of tumor and patient outcomes in the setting of total neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery or nonoperative management? Finding There were no prognostic differences between tumors of different mucin quantity in multiple outcomes, including local recurrence, local regrowth, recurrence, and disease-free survival.

Data regarding patient demographics, clinicopathology, and treatment were obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to identify predictors of ONI with odds ratios (ORs) and overall survival.ResultsIn total, 522 patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Most patients were elderly (>60 years old, 55.0%), male (67.2%), White (86.4%), and insured with Medicare (44.1%).

In addition to the da Vinci® system, several new surgical robotic systems have been developed, demonstrating comparable safety and efficacy (5-7). This study reports our experience with robotic-assisted Boari-flap using the KangDuo-Surgical-Robot-01 (KD-SR-01) System in managing long-segment BUES after radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. A 64-year-old man developed left BUES 2.5 years after robot-assisted radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. After nephrostomy drainage for 6 months, a robotic-assisted Boari-flap was performed using the KD-SR-01 system in the Trendelenburg position. Surgical steps included: neobladder mobilization, distal ureter dissection, neobladder flap creation, ureter-flap anastomosis, and flap tubularization. Surgery was successful without conversion. The stricture length was 5 cm. The neobladder flap measured 5 × 3 cm (length × width). Operating time was 145 minutes, with 30 mL of blood loss. The nephrostomy tube and double-J stent were removed two months postoperatively. At three-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with stable serum creatinine. Cine magnetic resonance urography demonstrated normal ureteral peristalsis and ureteral jets. No postoperative complications occurred. Robotic-assisted Boari-flap after radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder is technically feasible. A larger cohort with longer follow-up is necessary to assess its safety and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Background The prognostic implications of middle neck involvement, defined as cervical lymph node metastasis between the caudal border of the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage, remain unclear in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Purpose To investigate the prognostic significance of middle neck involvement in patients with N1 or N2 NPC. Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with N1 or N2 NPC without distant metastasis treated between April 2009 and December 2017. Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of middle neck involvement, as determined at MRI. Survival analysis was performed by incorporating TN category and middle neck involvement. Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare survival outcomes. Results This study included 9795 patients (mean age, 45 years ± 11 [SD]; 7135 male). Middle neck involvement was identified in 17.0% of patients (1668 of 9795), with prevalence rates of 11.4% (848 of 7429) in the N1 subgroup and 34.7% (820 of 2366) in the N2 subgroup. Multivariable analysis revealed that middle neck involvement was an independent prognostic factor for reduced metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in both the N1 (all P < .001) and N2 subgroups (P = .001, .02, and .04, respectively). Patients with T1-T2 N1 NPC with middle neck involvement exhibited survival outcomes comparable to those in patients with T1-T2 N2 NPC (all P > .05). Conversely, patients with T3N1 disease without middle neck involvement had better 5-year MFS (91.7% vs 84.6%; P < .001), OS (90.6% vs 84.3%; P = .003), and DFS (83.6% vs 74.4%; P < .001) than those with middle neck involvement. Conclusion Middle neck involvement serves as a critical factor for risk stratification in N1 and N2 NPC. It helps identify patients at high risk within the T1-T2 N1 subgroup and those with T3N1 disease. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Preoperative MRI Segmentation of Paraspinal Muscles Is Associated with Intraoperative Findings of Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury.",
    "abstract": "Background Surgical decisions for traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI) depend on the severity of nerve root injury, especially total root avulsion and partial root avulsion, determined with MRI and intraoperative findings. However, the use of quantitative MRI indexes to distinguish normal roots, total root avulsion, and partial root avulsion remains to be explored. Purpose To develop a diagnostic system using paraspinal muscle volumetric segmentation in MRI assessments of TBPI. Materials and Methods In this single-center retrospective study, data from patients diagnosed with TBPI from December 2014 to June 2023 were reviewed. Cervical paraspinal muscles were volumetrically segmented using preoperative gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. Muscles were labeled according to injury side (right vs left), root level (C4 through C7), and layer depth (superficial to deep layers). Diagnostic accuracy of the ratio of the segmented muscle volume on the lesion side to that on the normal side (hereafter, L/N volume ratio), neurologic and/or physical examination, and MRI reports differentiating the severity of root injury (normal roots, partial root avulsion, and total root avulsion) were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis, with surgical findings as the reference standard. A P value of less than .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results In total, 145 patients with TBPI (mean age, 30 years ± 13 [SD]; 121 men) were evaluated. The L/N volume ratio in layer 4 paraspinal muscles (semispinalis cervicis and multifidus) was associated with TBPI severity at C4 through C7 (higher in patients with normal root vs partial root avulsion: P < .001 for C4 through C6, P = .16 for C7; higher in patients with partial vs total root avulsion: P = .03 for C4, P < .001 for C5 through C7). Optimal cutoff values were 0.95 (normal vs avulsion) and 0.80 (partial vs total root avulsion) based on pooled data. Diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for normal roots versus injured roots was 0.80 with neurologic and/or physical examination, 0.85 with MRI, and 0.88 with L/N volume ratio and that for partial versus total root avulsion was 0.59, 0.76, and 0.91, respectively. The L/N volume ratio cutoffs enabled accurate diagnosis of all four roots in 55.2% (80 of 145) and three of four roots in 29.0% (42 of 145) of patients. Conclusion MRI-based volumetric analysis of paraspinal muscles in patients with TBPI accurately distinguished the severity of root injury, which was associated with intraoperative findings. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 rearrangements (MLN-FGFR1) are associated with poor prognosis. They are caused by chromosome 8p11 rearrangements that result in FGFR1 fusion genes and constitutive FGFR1 activation. We report on a phase 2 study, in which there were no concurrent control patients, termed FIGHT-203, in which we evaluated the FGFR1-3 inhibitor, pemigatinib, for the treatment of MLN-FGFR1. We assigned eligible patients to receive oral pemigatinib 13.5 mg once daily (2 weeks on followed by 1 week off or continuously). End points included complete response rate (primary) and complete cytogenetic response rate. Responses were assessed locally by investigators per protocol-defined criteria and were retrospectively adjudicated by a central review committee using criteria defined by the committee. Of 47 treated patients (safety population), 45 had confirmed FGFR1 rearrangement and were analyzed for efficacy; of these patients, 24 (53%) were in the chronic phase of illness; 18 (40%) were in blast phase; and three previously treated patients (7%) exhibited the rearrangement without morphologic bone marrow or extramedullary involvement. The overall complete response rate, as determined by central review, was 74% (31 out of 42); this occurred in 96% (23 out of 24) of patients in chronic phase and 44% (8 out of 18) of patients in blast phase. A complete cytogenetic response was observed in 73% (33 out of 45) of patients overall, consisting of 88% (21 out of 24) of patients in chronic phase, 50% (9 out of 18) of patients in blast phase, and all three patients who had a rearrangement only. The median duration of complete response was not reached (95% confidence interval, 27.9 months to not reached). The most common any-grade treatment-emergent adverse event was hyperphosphatemia (76%); the most common grade-3-and-over event was stomatitis (19%). Pemigatinib discontinuation, interruption, and dose reduction occurred in 5 (11%), 30 (64%), and 28 (60%) patients, respectively. In our study, pemigatinib manifested near complete efficacy in chronic-phase patients with MLN-FGFR1, while the complete response rate was close to 50% in blast-phase patients. Toxicities were manageable with dose modifications. (Funded by Incyte Corporation; FIGHT-203 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03011372.).",

PNI in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by clinical and morphologic heterogeneity. Although a specific score for PNI severity has been proposed, it lacks validation. In this prospective registered (NCT04024358) monocentric study, 300 patients undergoing pancreatectomy between March 2019 and February 2022 were analyzed. PNI was scored as: 0 absent; 1 presence of neoplasia along nerves<3 mm; 2 neoplastic infiltration of nerves≥3 mm and/or massive PNI and/or necrosis of the infiltrated nerves. Association of PNI with disease recurrence and survival was evaluated. Of 300 patients, 86% presented PNI, with 148 (49.3%) having PNI 1 and 110 (36.7%) PNI 2. Neoadjuvant treatment did not influence PNI (89.7% vs. 83.9% after treatment, P=0.332). PNI severity significantly correlated with worsening pathological features, shorter disease recurrence (24 mo for PNI 0, 17 for PNI 1 and 15 for PNI 2, P<0.01) and survival (57 mo for PNI 0, 51 for PNI 1 and 32 for PNI 2, P<0.01). PNI 2 independently predicted both recurrence and survival with HR of 2.082 (P=0.006) and 3.304 (P=0.014). PNI 2 benefitted most from adjuvant treatment, with longer disease recurrence time (17 vs. 12 mo; P=0.007) and survival (36 vs. 17 mo; P=0.004). The PNI severity score improves prognostic stratification of resected PDAC and identifies patients who benefit the most from adjuvant treatment.",

    "abstract": "Precision nutrition seeks to optimize human health by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, microbial, and lifestyle profiles. In this context, whole grains (WGs) serve as ideal candidates, as their diverse fiber structures and grain-specific phytochemicals interact dynamically with host physiology and the gut microbiome. This review examines six widely consumed WGs: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), brown rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn (Zea mays L.), focusing on their distinct dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. WGs should not be viewed as uniform fiber sources. The quantity, structural complexity, solubility, viscosity, and fermentability of fibers vary among different WGs, contributing to the distinct health benefits of each grain. Moreover, while these grains offer general nutritional benefits, each grain contains unique secondary metabolites. Key examples include alkylresorcinols (ARs) in wheat and rye, avenanthramides (AVAs) in oats, hordatines in barley, γ-oryzanols (γ-OZs) and tricin in rice, and polyamine-conjugated hydroxycinnamates (PACH) in corn. These grain-specific phytochemicals exert diverse pharmacodynamic effects across metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative pathways. For instance, hordatines shows effects on cardiovascular and glycemic regulation; ARs, γ-OZs, and tricin support lipid homeostasis and colorectal cancer mitigation; AVAs possess anti-inflammatory and microbiota-modulating properties; and PACH contribute to antioxidant capacity. Such functional specificity positions WGs as strategic components in individualized nutrition frameworks, holding promise for disease prevention and health optimization within the paradigm of precision nutrition.",

    "abstract": "PARP1 serves as a crucial protein for preserving genomic stability, especially in BRCA1/2-mutant cancers that lack homologous recombination repair. In response to DNA breaks, PARP1 triggers an allosteric response that communicates to its catalytic domain, initiating the synthesis of poly (ADP-ribose) from NAD+. In this study, we used RMSF, hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, and MMPBSA analyses to construct an interface-specific map of PARP1 activation, revealing how DNA, Zn ions, and NAD+ act at each domain interface to drive activation. Our findings show that DNA initiates allosteric signaling, Zn ions and NAD+ strengthen activating interfaces and weaken inhibitory contacts. We found that PARP1 recognizes DNA damage through its ZF1, ZF3, and WGR domains with Zn ions at ZF1 stabilizing DNA binding. Allosteric contacts arose at the ZF1-ZF3 interface strengthened by DNA, ZF3-WGR interface reinforced by Zn ions, and ZF1-WGR interface stabilized by both DNA and Zn ions. This allosteric communication, alongside NAD+, induced a conformational shift in the HD domain enhancing WGR-HD and ZF3-HD interactions and destabilizing HD-ART. This movement, opened the catalytic pocket for NAD+ binding, promoting PARylation. Our study shows that full PARP1 activation requires the PARP1-DNA-Zn-NAD+ complex. These findings advance understanding of PARP1 and may aid development of targeted inhibitors for synthetic lethality-based cancer therapy. The study provides novel insights into the activation of PARP1 by focusing on the structural and dynamic changes that occur upon its binding to DNA, NAD+, and zinc ions.In the ZF1, ZF3, and WGR domains, specific residues identified are responsible for recognizing DNA damage and forming interactions with the DNA backbone, with distinct changes observed in their binding patterns in the presence of Zn ions and DNA.The detection of DNA damage and the consequent binding of DNA to PARP1 triggers allosteric interactions between the ZF1, ZF3, WGR, and HD domains, with different signaling patterns observed in the presence or absence of NAD+ and Zn ions.The presence of NAD+ shifts the HD domain, leading to the binding of NAD+ to its pocket and the consequent activation of the ART domain for poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation. The study observes the effect of NAD+ on conformation, energy, and binding affinity of the catalytic (CAT) domain.This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms of PARP1 activation and DNA repair processes, providing insights that may guide the development of targeted cancer therapies.",

The nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is an innovative paclitaxel formulation that has shown significant effectiveness against various drug-resistant cancers. Nab-PTX can cause rare ocular adverse events including CME. Although nab-PTX has been associated with CME, there have been no documented cases of CME resulting from PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). This report presents the case of a 55-year-old woman who experienced CME one week after starting combination chemotherapy with nab-PTX and PLD. This occurred much earlier than previously reported cases of CME induced by nab-PTX. Despite discontinuing PLD treatment for 2 months, her symptoms did not improve. It is possible that interactions between multiple chemotherapeutic drugs contribute to this adverse reaction. Although nab-PTX and PLD are known to have improved efficacy and safety profiles, their combined use can result in CME.

    "abstract": "The susceptibility of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) infection pose significant challenges to CRC treatment and prevention. This study addresses these challenges by mobilizing cGAS/STING axis activation and F. nucleatum-specific targeting, thereby achieving a multimodal treatment strategy for reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment (ITM) and achieving targeted anti-F. nucleatum therapy. Specifically, a hybrid nanoplatform CuPpIX@HM was engineered using Escherichia coli and tumor cell membranes encapsulating ultrasound (US) stimulation-responsive copper protoporphyrin IX (CuPpIX). This design enables the precise accumulation of the nanoplatform at tumor sites following oral administration. Notably, upon US activation, CuPpIX generates a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively eradicating F. nucleatum and exerting potent antitumor effects. Meanwhile, bacterial membrane components activate the cGAS/STING signaling pathway, effectively reversing the ITM, enhancing systemic antitumor immunity. Importantly, CuPpIX@HM exerts minimal disruption to healthy intestinal microbiota and remarkably increases the level of probiotics. In both orthotopic and liver metastasis, CRC models demonstrated that this strategy could significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our study presents a highly targeted multimodal nanotherapy that holds strong potential to improve CRC treatment outcomes through the precision modulation of F. nucleatum and immune activation.",

Pancreatic cancer cells frequently overexpress tumor-associated antigens, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Mesothelin (Meso). In this study, we therefore investigated the therapeutic effect of tandem dual CAR-T cells co-targeting Her2 and Meso versus single-targeted CAR-T cells in pancreatic cancer models. We constructed a dual CAR by fusing a HER2-binding single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) with a Meso-binding ScFv. The expression levels of CARs and the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T cells were systematically compared via in vitro and in vivo experiments. In HER2/Meso co-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1 and SW-1990), dual CAR-T cells exhibited superior antitumor activity, accompanied by increased secretion of anti-tumor cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ), compare to HER2-specific or Meso-specific single-target CAR-T cells. In a xenograft mouse model, dual CAR-T cells significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged mouse survival relative to single-target CAR-T cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that dual CAR-T cells enhance antitumor cytotoxicity, supporting their potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for Pancreatic Cancer and other solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are widely used in cancer therapy but often suffer from off-target effects due to their pan-inhibitory activity towards zinc-dependent enzymes. Vorinostat (SAHA), a hydroxamate-based HDACi, has been shown to lack isoform selectivity, potentially leading to unintended interactions with other metalloenzymes. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of SAHA bound to human carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and a carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) active-site mimic. Structures determined at room temperature and 100 K revealed two distinct SAHA conformers in both CA II and the CA IX mimic, with the hydroxamate moiety displacing the zinc-bound water and adopting either a tetrahedral or pentahedral coordination to Zn2+. Differences in hydrophobic interactions were observed between CA II and the CA IX mimic due to the F131V amino-acid difference between the two enzymes. SwissDock modeling accurately predicted the SAHA binding orientations observed in crystallography. Thermal shift assays using nanoDSF showed minimal stabilization of either CA by SAHA, in contrast to the potent CA inhibitor acetazolamide. Binding-energy calculations suggest that SAHA may bind carbonic anhydrases with affinities comparable to its HDAC targets. These findings highlight potential off-target binding of SAHA to carbonic anhydrases, which may contribute to its clinical side effects. The results also suggest that hydroxamates may serve as a nonsulfonamide scaffold for novel CA inhibitors, although isoform selectivity remains a challenge.",

The changes in CEA expression during relapses, influenced by resistance mechanisms involving cytokines and epigenetic factors, may impact its utility in disease prognosis, monitoring, and management. This retrospective study analyzed advanced LUAD patients treated between 2011 and 2018, including 182 patients receiving EGFR-TKIs and 102 undergoing chemotherapies. Serum CEA levels were measured at baseline and relapse. Associations between CEA levels, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes were assessed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Gene expression profiling and in vitro experiments explored the regulation of CEACAM5 expression by cytokines and epigenetic mechanisms in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells. Elevated baseline CEA (≥ 5 ng/mL) was associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS) in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs but showed no prognostic value in chemotherapy-treated patients. During the relapse, EGFR-TKI-treated patients were more likely to exhibit a transition to CEA-negative status (< 5 ng/mL) compared to those receiving chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that EGFR-TKI-resistant cells displayed reduced CEACAM5 expression and increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, driven by cytokine signaling and epigenetic modifications. Serum CEA is a stronger prognostic biomarker for LUAD patients treated with EGFR-TKIs while offering consistent monitoring capabilities in chemotherapy-treated patients. These findings highlight the differential clinical value of serum CEA in guiding therapeutic strategies and monitoring disease progression across treatment modalities.",

Patients were treated with liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and levoleucovorin (Nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV), gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GnP), or gemcitabine (GEM) as second-line chemotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer. All respondents used ePRO to answer several QoL questionnaires on Days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11 following chemotherapy administration. The primary endpoint was the EQ-5D-5L index value, and the secondary endpoints were AE frequency and the EORTC QLQ-C30. The analysis included 67 participants. The mean ± SD QoL scores of the Nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV and GnP arms varied from 0.803 ± 0.142 to 0.678 ± 0.247 and 0.872 ± 0.077 to 0.726 ± 0.185, respectively, over the evaluation period. The highest and lowest QoL scores were observed around the chemotherapy administration and approximately 1 week after the chemotherapy administration, respectively, in both arms. Patients' QoL score assessment over time by ePRO revealed QoL score trends, which emphasized the importance of QoL management outside of hospital visits for each chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The global aging population includes an increasing number of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to clarify the real-world outcomes, prognostic factors, and appropriate administration indicators for immunotherapy in elderly HCC patients. This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 286 patients with unresectable HCC who received first-line immunotherapy (atezolizumab-bevacizumab or durvalumab-tremelimumab) between November 2020 and January 2024. Patients were categorized into the late elderly (LE; ≥ 75 years, n = 117) and non-late elderly (non-LE; ≤ 74 years, n = 169) groups. Baseline characteristics, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and prognostic factors were evaluated. The LE group had significantly poorer performance status, lower albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores, lower alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and alanine transaminase levels, higher creatinine levels, and were significantly less likely to receive post-immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment compared with the non-LE group (56.2% vs. 38.4%, p = 0.0038). Median OS and PFS for the LE group were 25.6 and 10.5 months, respectively. The LE group demonstrated a comparable disease control rate (82.0%) and safety profile. The ALBI score was a significant prognostic factor for both groups. Post-ICI treatment significantly improved OS only in the non-LE group, even after propensity score matching for ALBI score and AFP levels. Immunotherapy is effective and well-tolerated in LE patients with unresectable HCC, particularly in those with preserved liver function (mALBI grade 1/2a). Post-ICI treatment significantly benefits non-LE patients, with limited impact on LE patients, highlighting the need for therapeutic strategies based on age and liver function.",

    "abstract": "Breast acinar cell carcinoma (AciCC) is a rare breast cancer subtype that exhibits morphological similarities to salivary gland AciCC. However, the molecular profile of breast AciCC differs significantly from that of salivary gland AciCC, suggesting that they may not be related. Whether breast AciCC represents a distinct breast cancer subtype remains controversial. This study analysed two groups of breast AciCCs. Using comprehensive morphological, immunohistochemical, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and next-generation sequencing analyses, we elucidated the similarities and differences between these two distinct types of 'breast AciCCs' and their salivary gland counterpart. The first, based on morphological and immunohistochemical features, satisfied the 2019 World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for breast AciCC. Notably, NR4A3, a specific marker for salivary gland AciCC, was not expressed in these cases. We propose designating this tumour type as 'carcinoma with acinar cell differentiation'. In contrast, the second group included a case of AciCC in situ, which demonstrated morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular features identical to those of salivary gland AciCC, including NR4A3 protein overexpression and NR4A3 gene rearrangement. This case was considered a precursor of true salivary gland-type AciCC originating in the breast. This study provides new insights into breast AciCC nomenclature: the widely recognised AciCC name, 'carcinoma with acinar cell differentiation' might be more appropriate. Although true salivary gland-type AciCC requires additional cases for confirmation, our case has clarified that true salivary gland-type AciCC can indeed exist in the breast.",

Cell proliferation (EdU and CCK8 assays), migration, invasion (wound healing and Transwell assays), cell cycle, and apoptosis (flow cytometry) were assessed. Levels of GNL3L, MDM2, p53, and p21 were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Tumor growth was observed in nude mice injected with TE-1 cells. GNL3L was upregulated in ESCC specimens (p < 0.05) and knockdown reduced proliferation and migration while enhancing apoptosis (p < 0.01). GNL3L interacted with MDM2; knocking down GNL3L decreased MDM2 and increased p53 and p21 (p < 0.01). MDM2 overexpression enhanced malignant characteristics, reversible by GNL3L silencing (p < 0.01). Moreover, MDM2 knockdown inhibited malignant characteristics, reversible by GNL3L overexpression (p < 0.01). In vivo, the sh-GNL3L group exhibited the smallest tumor volumes after 5 weeks (p < 0.01). GNL3L correlates with ESCC malignancy, influencing the MDM2-p53-p21 axis. GNL3L-MDM2 interaction is critical in ESCC progression.",

This study aimed to identify risk factors for malignant transformation in IPMN and develop a predictive model using data from a large medical center in western China. Patients with IPMN admitted to West China Hospital between January 2010 and February 2022 were included in this study. They were divided into benign and malignant. Characteristic parameters and laboratory results were collected. The training set and test set were randomly divided at a ratio of 7:3. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to select potential prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed by logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the model's predictive performance. We retrospectively analyzed 182 patients, identifying six independent predictors of malignancy: classification, cyst wall thickening, abrupt changes in main pancreatic duct caliber, maximum tumor diameter, maximum main pancreatic duct diameter, and lnCA19-9. We developed a nomogram with an area under the curve of 0.86 in the training set and 0.81 in the test set. The model showed strong predictive ability, providing a valuable tool for clinicians to guide preoperative decision-making. Our study offers the first predictive model for malignant IPMN in western China and highlights the importance of comprehensive risk assessment, incorporating clinical, imaging, and laboratory data.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) expression in early-stage CMF. We retrospectively analyzed 106 patients with early-stage CMF diagnosed at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, between 2009 and 2021. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess GATA3 expression in dermal tumor cells. Associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using Cox regression models adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate predictive performance. High GATA3 expression (≥ 60%) was detected in 92.5% of cases. Elevated GATA3 levels were significantly associated with reduced PFS and OS. IPTW-adjusted Cox regression confirmed high GATA3 expression as an independent adverse prognostic factor. ROC curve analysis demonstrated strong predictive performance for CMF progression (AUC = 0.867), with an optimal cutoff of 57.5% (sensitivity 73.7%, specificity 94.3%). For clinical applicability, a 60% threshold was adopted. High GATA3 expression is an independent adverse prognostic biomarker in early-stage CMF. Incorporating GATA3 into risk stratification models may improve prognostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies.",

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of radiation therapist (RT)-led MRI-guided ART for oligometastatic disease (OMD) by comparing geometric accuracy and dosimetric differences between RT and radiation oncologist (RO) re-contouring. Five RTs and five ROs retrospectively re-contoured gross target volumes (GTVs) and organs-at-risk (OARs) for eight OMD cases. RT and RO contours were compared against consensus RO Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (RO-STAPLE) contours using the Dice similarity coefficient (DICE), mean distance to agreement (MDA), planning target volume (PTV) D95 and OAR D0.5cc using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Moreover, an RO qualitatively scored all contours using a 5-point Likert scale. We found very good geometric accuracy with average (±standard deviation) GTV DICE of 0.82 ± 0.06 for RTs and 0.85 ± 0.09 for ROs and MDA of 0.88 ± 0.03 mm for RT and 0.75 ± 0.05 mm for ROs relative to the RO-STAPLE. Qualitative GTV Likert scores were excellent, 4.8/5 for RTs and 4.7/5 for ROs. Mean percent difference in PTV D95 compared to RO-STAPLE was small but significantly higher for RTs (0.5% ± 1.5%) compared with ROs (-0.7% ± 1.9%, p < 0.05). Mean relative change in OAR D0.5cc results was small with -1% ± 6% for RTs and -1% ± 12% for ROs. Here we provide the first report of geometric and dosimetric contouring uncertainty for MR-guided online ART for OMD. Our results show that RT re-contouring maintains similar performance for eligible targets and OARs compared with RO contours, establishing the initial feasibility of an RT-led workflow.",

Therefore, it is very important to use valid and reliable scales that assess the risk of constipation in order to prevent its occurrence in cancer patients. This study aims to assess the validity and reliability of the Constipation Risk Assessment Scale (CRAS) when applied to the Turkish population with cancer. A total of 102 outpatients with cancer were included in the study. According to the Rome IV criteria, participants were divided into two groups: constipated and non-constipated. All patients were evaluated using the CRAS. A subset of patients was randomly selected for retesting with the CRAS. In the evaluation of the test-retest reliability of the CRAS, Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values were found to be 0.97 (0.93-0.99) for the total CRAS score and between 0.83 (0.64-0.94) and 0.96 (0.92-0.97) for the subscales. The retest reliability was found to be high (p<0.001). Significant correlations were observed between the total CRAS score and all subscales with the Rome IV criteria, as well as between the CRAS medication subscale and the Rome IV criteria. The present study showed that the Turkish version of the CRAS is a valid and reliable tool for use with outpatients with cancer. The CRAS can be effectively utilized to identify individuals at risk of constipation and to develop targeted prevention programs. Healthcare professionals can use the Turkish version of the CRAS as a reliable tool to assess constipation risk among cancer patients.",

In parallel, mRNA expression levels of ZEB1, a key transcription factor involved in WNT signaling, stem cell maintenance and tumor-stroma interactions were quantified for each sample.ResultsThe measured T1 and T2 relaxation times showed distinct profiles between tumor and non-tumor tissues. These biophysical properties were correlated with ZEB1 mRNA expression, revealing preliminary associations between tissue relaxation behavior and molecular signatures relevant to tumor microenvironment dynamics.ConclusionAlthough this pilot study does not yet confirm clinical diagnostic utility, it offers initial biophysical insights into tumor-associated tissue alterations and provides a foundation for future validation studies in larger patient cohorts.",

Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is superior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) for detecting progressive disease (PD) in bone-only metastatic breast cancer; however, the ability to detect PD in mixed visceral- and bone-metastasizing breast cancer remains to be assessed in prospective studies.PurposeTo prospectively compare WB-MRI and CE-CT for detecting PD in mixed visceral- and bone-metastasizing breast cancer and determine if WB-MRI could detect PD earlier than CE-CT.Material and MethodsA total of 43 women with mixed visceral- and bone-metastasizing breast cancer were prospectively followed with WB-MRI and CE-CT from the initiation of new chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to progression was performed for both WB-MRI and CE-CT, and the time difference between the two was compared using a one-sample t-test. The ability to detect PD earliest was compared using McNemar's test.ResultsOf the 43 patients enrolled, 21 completed the study. Treatment was changed due to PD in 18 patients and due to side effects in three patients. Median time until change of treatment was 8 months (range=4-21 months). WB-MRI correctly detected PD in 16/18 patients compared to 13/18 for CE-CT. A total of 73 pairs of examinations were analyzed, of which WB-MRI detected PD earliest in 7/18 patients compared to 1/18 for CE-CT (P = 0.035).. There were no statistically significant differences in time to progression between WB-MRI and CE-CT (P = 0.41).ConclusionWB-MRI can detect PD in women with mixed visceral- and bone-metastasizing breast cancer earlier than CE-CT.",

    "abstract": "Fe3+-based metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) have been employed for anti-bacterial photothermal therapy (PTT) enhanced chemodynamic therapy (CDT) owing to their good photothermal properties and Fenton catalytic reactivity. However, their application in anti-bacterial therapy and wound healing was seriously limited by the lack of Fenton reaction efficiency and wound-healing-promoting capabilities. To address this challenge, we developed a sodium alginate (SA)-based cryogel (STCF) containing Fe3+/Cu2+-based bimetallic MPNs. The STCF cryogel was fabricated by co-crosslinking tannic acid (TA) and SA with both Fe3+ and Cu2+, followed by lyophilization of the formed hydrogel. The integrated bimetallic MPNs could endow it with synergistic PTT/CDT. Additionally, the released Cu2+ could promote angiogenesis and contribute to tissue regeneration. In vitro anti-bacterial assays demonstrated its synergistic bactericidal efficacy, while in vivo hemostasis models and infected wound model proved its good hemostatic, anti-bacterial, and wound-healing-promoting effects. Therefore, through integrating bimetallic MPNs into the STCF cryogel, our study proposed a novel strategy to explore multifunctional wound dressings for treating infected wounds, which overcomes the challenges in wound care and infection management.",

Search criteria included peer-reviewed articles on therapeutic applications and cosmeceutical formulations.Data SummaryRadiodermatitis affects 95% of individuals exposed to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy, presenting symptoms like erythema, pruritus, ulcers, and necrosis. Current treatments rely heavily on corticosteroids, which cause side effects like skin atrophy and systemic reactions. Phytoconstituents offer safer alternatives by neutralizing free radicals and protecting against radiation-induced skin damage. Their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory actions align with mechanisms involved in radiodermatitis healing. Research highlights their efficacy in preventing bacterial superinfection and promoting skin recovery. Phytoconstituents are increasingly incorporated into cosmeceutical products for cancer patients.ConclusionsPhytoconstituent-based preparations promise safer alternatives to corticosteroids for managing radiodermatitis.

    "title": "Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Situationally-Bound Judgements of Listener Comfort for Postlaryngectomy Voice and Speech.",
    "abstract": "The influence of the listening environment in which communication occurs has been of longstanding interest related to communication disorders. It also has been posited that specific listening scenarios may differentially effect listener judgements of a speaker. In the case of those who have lost their larynx and normal voice due to cancer, a listener's assessment may carry a substantial penalty. This study was designed to determine if situationally-bound communication 'scenario' influences a listener's auditory-perceptual judgement of level of comfort for three modes of postlaryngectomy alaryngeal speech: oesophageal (ES), tracheo-oesophageal (TE) and electrolaryngeal (EL) speech. Additionally, a modified oesophageal speech (MES) group where air insufflation pauses were excluded digitally, was also included; this modification was employed to reduce the potential impact of unusual, non-junctural pauses that may occur in some oesophageal speakers. Forty-eight speaker samples (12 speakers per alaryngeal group) were evaluated by 22 naïve adult listeners for a dimension termed listener comfort (LC). Judgements assessed all speaker samples based on two implied listening scenarios: (1) a social conversation interaction (LC-Soc) and (2) a telephone conversation (LC-Tel). Both scenarios were rated by listeners using a visual analogue scaling procedure. Ratings were provided in a counterbalanced manner across two sessions separated by 7-10 days. Listener ratings were not found to differ significantly by listening scenario (social vs. telephone) for any given speech mode. However, significant differences were observed in listener judgements of TE speakers when compared to EL, ES and MES speaker samples for both LC-Soc and LC-Tel listening scenarios. Further, a significant correlation was found between judgements of LC-Soc and LC-Tel, indicating a strong relationship between the two. Listeners indicated that they were more comfortable listening to TE speakers when compared to the other postlaryngectomy speech modes that were evaluated. This suggests that in general, a listener's perceived LC may be more favourable to TE speech. Thus, these comparative findings provide objective data on how a listener may respond to postlaryngectomy communication methods and, consequently, may offer valuable insights into the relative merits of these postlaryngectomy communication rehabilitation methods. Collectively, the findings of this study add important information that can assist in both pre- and postoperative counselling for those who undergo laryngectomy. What is already known on this subject Although information is available on how listeners rate various methods of postlaryngectomy voice and speech, namely esophageal speech (ES), tracheo-oesophageal speech (TE) and electrolaryngeal (EL) speech, as well as how they characterize speakers through auditory-perceptual evaluation, there is little information on the influence of situationally-bound judgements. In this regard, the auditory-perceptual feature termed 'listener comfort' (LC) may provide valuable information in relation to different listening scenarios. Thus, efforts that seek to quantify how unique listening situations influence listeners judgements of LC are important. These data may provide new information that would be of benefit to counselling specific to potential communication challenges that may evolve from listener responses to alaryngeal methods and their use in common communication situations. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study identified that while listener ratings of LC were not found to differ between the two listening scenarios (social vs. telephone) evaluated, the mode of postlaryngectomy speech and voice must be considered. More specifically, our data revealed significantly better listener judgements of LC were found for TE speakers when compared to the other speech modes for both listening scenarios that were assessed. The data also show that when speech intelligibility is reduced as a potential variable, considerable variability exists both within and across the modes of alaryngeal speech evaluated. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The present data may provide important guidance relative to counselling of those who undergo total laryngectomy. Those who use any method of alaryngeal voice and speech must be aware that some listeners may react negatively to the quality of their speech. Thus, acknowledging the interaction between both the speaker and the listener is essential. Information related to how listeners may respond to specific modes of postlaryngectomy voice and speech and how specific communication scenarios may influence a listener's response can serve as valuable educational information for both clinicians and those individuals they serve as part of the postlaryngectomy rehabilitation process. Although speakers are unable to directly modify a listener's reaction to their postlaryngectomy voice quality, they may be able to directly acknowledge their challenges, which may reduce the burden on listeners in communication interactions. Thus, these data may serve to expand the extent of information provided in both pre- and postoperative laryngectomy counselling.",

However, dissecting the roles of these enzymes in cellular signaling is hindered by the lack of a plug-and-play methodology for the direct, temporal control of small GTPase activity by using user-defined inputs. Herein, we present a method that pairs split-small GTPases with user-defined chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) systems in a plug-and-play manner to directly control small GTPase signaling in living cells. The modularity of split-small GTPase systems allows for the selection of CIDs with minimal off-target effects on the pathway being studied. Our results highlight the ability to obtain consistent pathway activation with varying CID systems for direct control of MAPK signaling, filopodia formation, and cell retraction.

    "abstract": "Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, a type of autoimmune encephalitis, characterized by acute onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, predominantly affects young females and is often associated with ovarian teratomas. Although small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a known cause of paraneoplastic encephalitis, its association with anti-NMDAR encephalitis is rare and often carries a poor prognosis due to limited response to immunotherapy. An 80-year-old male with no psychiatric history presented with flu-like symptoms, followed by the acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including pressured speech, agitation, memory impairment, and abnormal behavior. Autoimmune encephalitis was suspected due to mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count and a mass in the right upper lung detected by whole-body computed tomography (CT) on the first day of hospitalization. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids were administered on Day 1, resulting in prompt and sustained improvement in symptoms. CSF was later confirmed positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies, and a bronchoscopy biopsy of the pulmonary mass diagnosed SCLC. The patient recovered without neurological deficits and was discharged in stable condition on hospital Day 30. This was a rare case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis associated with SCLC in an elderly male patient. Diagnosis in elderly individuals is often challenging because of the atypical presentations and lower tumor association. Nevertheless, timely intervention initiation may lead to favorable outcomes. Clinicians should consider autoimmune encephalitis, including anti-NMDAR encephalitis, when evaluating acute onset neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly individuals and initiate early immunotherapy alongside tumor screening.",

A multicentre, retrospective, propensity score matched case-control study was conducted based on electronic medical records in patients with ChILI from December 2019 to December 2022 in five tertiary hospitals. Cases were categorised into combination therapy group and steroid monotherapy group. A total of 229 cases were included, with 114 in the combination therapy group and 115 in the steroid group.

    "abstract": "Relapse remains the primary cause of transplant failure in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), yet prognostic data are scarce. We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of 104 adult T-LBL patients in complete metabolic remission (CMR) undergoing allo-HSCT. Pretransplant Deauville score (DS) was evaluated, and a risk model integrating DS, immunophenotype and donor type was developed. Patients with DS of 3 had significantly inferior 2-year overall survival (OS) (70.5% vs. 77.4% vs. 86.8%, p < 0.001), progression-free survival (PFS) (51.5% vs. 73.0% vs. 81.1%, p < 0.001) and higher relapse rates (42.1% vs. 15.4% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001) compared to DS of 1-2. Multivariable analysis identified pretransplant DS, immunophenotype and donor type as independent risk factors for post-transplant relapse. These variables were integrated to construct a novel risk model stratifying patients into low- (66.0%), intermediate- (21.3%) and high-risk (12.7%) groups, strongly discriminating OS (p < 0.001), PFS (p < 0.001) and relapse (p < 0.001), with a C-index of 0.706. Internal validation confirmed that the risk stratification model had good discrimination, calibration and clinical benefit. Our findings propose a clinically actionable tool to identify high-risk T-LBL patients for tailored post-transplant strategies.",

However, the clinical implications of these technologies remain incompletely understood. To evaluate patterns and clinical utility of genetic sequencing among patients with rectal cancer. Retrospective cohort analysis from a prospectively maintained institutional registry. Single National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. A total of 251 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer between January 2017 and April 2024, who underwent genetic testing. Somatic tumor sequencing and circulating tumor DNA analysis. Response to total neoadjuvant therapy, local recurrence, and distant metastasis. Genetic testing utilization increased substantially from 2017 to 2024, with somatic next generation sequencing testing rising from 3% to 33% and circulating tumor DNA from 2% to over 45%. Tumor mutational burden did not correlate significantly with response to total neoadjuvant therapy, recurrence, or metastasis. Mutation profiles across carcinogenesis pathways showed no significant differences between complete responders and those with residual disease after adjustment (p = 0.145). After total neoadjuvant therapy, circulating tumor DNA positivity strongly correlated with residual disease (sensitivity: 76.5%, specificity: 82.4%; p = 0.0016), with tumor-agnostic circulating tumor DNA assays demonstrating significantly higher sensitivity than tumor-informed tests (100% vs. 50%, p = 0.03). Retrospective design, potential selection bias, single-center data. Despite increasing adoption, somatic next generation sequencing alone lacks clear prognostic or predictive utility for rectal cancer management. In contrast, circulating tumor DNA testing demonstrated substantial promise for assessing response to total neoadjuvant therapy, particularly using tumor-agnostic platforms. Further prospective studies are needed to refine clinical guidelines and fully integrate these genetic technologies into rectal cancer care. See Video Abstract.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare cancer with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. While first-line combination therapies have improved outcomes, second-line treatment remains challenging. Ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, has shown promise in treating IDH1 mutant CCA, but real-world data is limited. This study aims to evaluate ivosidenib's efficacy and safety in a large cohort of patients and compare it with second-line chemotherapy. This observational, retrospective, multicenter study included patients with advanced IDH1 mutant CCA treated with ivosidenib at 11 European institutions from May 2021 to September 2024. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); the main secondary objectives were overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), overall response rate (ORR) and safety. As a pre-planned exploratory objective, mPFS and OS of second-line ivosidenib and FOLFOX/CAPOX were compared by means of inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)-adjusted analysis. The study included 46 patients treated with Ivosidenib; 43.5% received ivosidenib as second line and 56.5% as ≥ third line. Median PFS and OS were 3.7 (95% CI, 2.2-36.5) and 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.5-36.5). DCR was 50.0%. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 8.7% of patients. IPTW-adjusted mPFS was 6.9 months with ivosidenib and 2.1 months with FOLFOX/CAPOX (HR: 0.36, 95% CI, 0.20-0.64, p = 0.0005), while the mOS was 15.9 and 9.0 months with ivosidenib and FOLFOX/CAPOX, respectively (HR: 0.47, 95% CI, 0.23-0.96, p = 0.0405). This study suggests that ivosidenib is a valid option for patients affected by metastatic IDH1 mutant CCA after at least one line of standard treatment.",

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome is a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome caused by pathogenic mutations in DNA mismatch repair (path_MMR) genes. Due to the elevated cancer risk, novel screening methods, alongside current surveillance techniques, could enhance cancer risk stratification. Here we show how bi-omics integration could be utilized to pinpoint potential cancer-predicting biomarkers in Lynch syndrome. We studied which blood-based circulating microRNAs and metabolites could predict Lynch syndrome cancer occurrence within a 5.8-year prospective surveillance period. We used single- and bi-omics bioinformatic analyses and identified omics-level patterns and associations across these biological layers. Lasso Cox regression was used to highlight the most promising cancer-predicting biomarkers. Our findings revealed distinct circulating metabolite landscapes among path_MMR variant carriers and a circulating microRNA co-expression module significantly associated with future cancer incidence. These microRNAs regulate cancer-related pathways, including the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Additionally, a metabolite module consisting of ApoB-containing lipoproteins (low-, intermediate-, and very low-density lipoproteins) showed distinct levels across path_MMR variants. Notably, three biomarkers-hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-183-5p, and triglycerides in high-density lipoprotein particles (HDL_TG)-significantly predicted cancer risk, achieving a Harrel's Concordance Index (C-index) of 0.76 (p = .0007). Elevated levels of these biomarkers indicated increased cancer risk. Internal validation of the model yielded a C-index of 0.72. The bi-omics approach and the identified biomarkers offer promising insights for future studies regarding cancer risk identification in Lynch syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of cancer vaccines depends significantly on adjuvants that can stimulate robust Th1 immune responses. However, conventional inorganic adjuvants like Alum generally elicit Th2-biased immune response. Despite recent efforts in developing organic adjuvants to mimic bacterial or viral infections for generating Th1 immunity, excessive inflammation remains a major concern. Herein, a new class of Th1-biased adjuvant is reported via passivation engineering of zinc peroxide nanoparticles (p-ZPNs) for potentiating the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines. p-ZPNs show improved biocompatibility compared to unpassivated ZPNs due to retarded zinc ion release and hydrogen peroxide production, as well as efficient cellular uptake, endosome escape, dendritic cell maturation and antigen cross presentation. Mechanistic study indicates the intrinsic activity of p-ZPNs to activate toll-like receptors (TLR)-2, 4, and 6, triggering the TLR/Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)/Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) axis for producing proinflammatory cytokines and therefore a robust Th1 immunity. Biosafety evaluation has shown the importance of the passivation engineering of ZPNs in reducing safety risks. Furthermore, in a p-ZPNs-based autologous cancer vaccine model, potent immune response is demonstrated in the inhibition of B16F10 tumors in both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination settings. These findings suggest the great potential of p-ZPN adjuvants for future Th1-biased vaccine development.",

We utilized population-level data to understand the coalition's reach to counties experiencing health inequities. Community-based organizations (N = 29) involved in this coalition all served rural counties and counties with greater burden from COVID-19 hospitalizations, heart disease mortality, and cancer mortality. Food quality and access, economic stability, and education were identified by coalition members as the primary determinants of health impacting their communities. Coalition members completed a baseline survey, participated in coalition activities focused on addressing these primary determinants of health, and then completed a follow-up survey 3-months later. Coalition members reported significant increases in several domains of their community-based organizations' capacity to address select determinants of health across assessments. Specifically, there were significant increases in the average number of partnerships facilitated and the average number of educational sessions offered by the community-based organization that addressed economic stability, education, and food access and quality. The Arkansas Social Justice Coalition effectively created a network of 29 community-based organizations dedicated to addressing determinants of health to reduce the disproportionate burden of COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, and cancer affecting their communities. Engagement in the coalition resulted in early improvements in several capacity domains during our coalition's formative stage, which may translate to improvements in long-term outcomes related to promoting health equity at the community level.",

    "abstract": "Venetoclax (VEN) in combination with azacitidine (AZA) (VEN-AZA) is used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy but research on prognostic factors remains limited. Measurable residual disease (MRD) by multiparametric flow cytometry in AML is important but there is limited evidence of the clinical utility of monitoring MRD in patients treated with VEN-AZA. Herein, a total of 75 patients newly diagnosed with AML treated with VEN-AZA were retrospectively analyzed to examine the role and timing of MRD to predict survival. MRD enabled the categorization of patients into two groups: Day 14 MRD, >1% (MRD14-pos); and Day 14 MRD, ≤1% (MRD14-neg). Of the 75 patients, 31 (41.3%) had MRD14-neg, whereas 30 (40.0%) had not achieved complete remission (CR) after induction. MRD14-neg was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (p = .024) and event-free survival (EFS) (p = .044). In addition, MRD14-neg (p = .002 for both OS and EFS), CSF3R negative (CSF3Rneg) (p < .001 for both OS and EFS), and transplantation (p = .005 for OS; p = .007 for EFS) were associated with improved survival outcomes. Further subgroup analysis revealed that MRD14-pos patients who underwent transplantation showed a trend toward longer OS and EFS (p < .001 for both). Results in the MRD14-neg group were better than in the MRD14-pos group, and the prognosis for patients with AML was better when there was CSF3Rneg and transplantation. Additionally, for patients with AML with MRD14-pos, consolidation with transplantation may increase survival.",

In this bicentric retrospective study, 457 patients with IDH-mutant glioma and [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine or [11C]methionine positron emission tomography (PET) prior to radiotherapy or systemic treatment were included. Associations of maximum and mean tumor-to-background ratios (TBRmax/TBRmean) and PET-positive volume (PET volume) with time to next intervention (TTNI) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Overall, 251 (54.9%) patients with astrocytoma and 206 (45.1%) with oligodendroglioma were included. In patients with astrocytoma who underwent PET before resection, measurable disease according to PET RANO 1.0 criteria was associated with shorter TTNI compared to no/non-measurable disease (median 46.0 vs. 67.9 months; p=0.004). Univariable analysis showed an association of TTNI with TBRmax, TBRmean and PET volume in astrocytoma and PET volume in oligodendroglioma. Multivariable analyses including age, WHO grade, extent of resection, postoperative treatment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tumor extent indicated an association of TTNI with TBRmax (HR 1.48 [95%CI: 1.09-2.01]) and TBRmean (HR 1.93 [95%CI: 1.14-3.27]) in astrocytoma and PET volume (HR [10 ml increase]: 1.18 [95%CI: 1.03-1.36]) in oligodendroglioma.

Apart from other operations he performed, he focused also on breast surgery. Theodoros Aretaios was a prolific writer. He wrote two main textbooks in Greek. The one is a surgical atlas and the other a surgical pathology textbook. Apart from them he left a great archive of the patient he operated on.

Except two male patients all the others were women in Theodoros Aretaios' archive, and the vast majority suffered from breast cancer. Benign disease of the breast although more common were mentioned concisely. Theodoros Aretaios performed total or partial mastectomy, lymphadenectomy and he underlined that the excision of the thoracic muscles or even the ribs had nothing to offer apart from aggravating patient's condition allowing us today to understand his pioneering role in the medical thought of his time.

    "abstract": "The limited number of cost-utility studies of breast cancer conducted in China makes comparisons among different paclitaxel-based strategies difficult. To provide such data, a cost-utility analysis comparing albumin-bound formulation (nab)-paclitaxel (ABPTX), paclitaxel polymer micelles (PTXPM), and paclitaxel (PTX) for advanced breast cancer was performed. Tree Age Pro 2011 software was used to simulate a Markov model to perform a health economic evaluation. Patient-related data for this study were obtained from large multicenter Phase III clinical trial studies. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were considered as primary outcomes. The model results showed that the 60-cycle mortality rate was 98.3% in the ABPTX group and 99.7% in the PTXPM group. Cost-utility analysis calculated that ABPTX had an increased life expectancy of 0.183 QALYs compared with patients receiving PTXPM, with an incremental cost of $4,914.747, resulting in an ICER value of $26,846.310 per QALY. When the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was increased to approximately $30,000 per QALY, PTXPM had a 50% probability of being cost-effective compared with ABPTX. At the WTP threshold of $37,721.52/QALY in China, ABPTX is more cost-effective than PTXPM under equivalent efficacy and safety, from the Chinese healthcare perspective. 1. What is this article about?This study compares three different chemotherapy treatments for advanced breast cancer in China to find out which one offers the best value for money. The treatments are:Standard paclitaxel (PTX), a common chemotherapy drug.Albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABPTX), a newer form of the drug that may have fewer side effects.Paclitaxel polymer micelles (PTXPM), another newer form of the drug.We wanted to find out which treatment gives patients the best balance of effectiveness, safety, and cost so doctors and policymakers can make better decisions.2. What were the results of the study?ABPTX worked better than PTXPM, helping patients live longer with a better quality of life (+0.183 QALYs, which is about 2.2 extra months of healthy life).Both ABPTX and PTXPM were better than standard PTX – they helped patients live longer and cost less overall.ABPTX was the most cost-effective option at China’s typical healthcare budget limits ($37,721 per extra year of healthy life).3. Why does this matter?For patients: ABPTX may offer longer survival with fewer side effects compared to older treatments.For doctors/hospitals: This study helps choose the best treatment that fits China’s healthcare budget.For policymakers: ABPTX could be a good choice for insurance coverage since it balances cost and patient benefits.",

We retrospectively reviewed the images of patients who underwent 68Ga PSMA PET/CT for restaging for recurrent PCa between 2014 and 2019. All detected bone lesions were manually grouped as 'osteoblastic (OB), osteolytic (OL), mixed (M), and radio-occult (RO) lesions' and the number and percentage were determined. Different volumetric values are obtained for each type of bone metastasis using the LIFEx v7.3.0 program. The relationship between PSA level and these volumetric values will be determined by the Spearman correlation test. The relationship between the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) PCa grade group and volumetric values will be evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis correlation test. Seventy-one patients had a total of 599 bone metastasis. Of these lesions, 268 were OB (44.7%), 39 were OL (6.5%), 72 were M (12.0%), and 220 were RO (36.7%). Total lesion volume (TLV) (p: 0.001), total lesion activity (TLA) (p: 0.001), and OB-TLA (p: 0.042) were significantly different between ISUP grades. In addition, the total number of lesions showed a statistically significant difference between ISUP grades (p: 0.019).

The calcium manganese-based nanozyme exhibits dual enzyme (catalase and superoxide dismutase)-mimetic catalytic activities, scavenging reactive oxygen species and suppressing GSDMD cleavage, a key mediator of pyroptosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that the CaMn2O4 nanozyme significantly reduced pyroptotic cell death in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/nigericin (Ni)-stimulated cells. In a murine colitis model, CaMn2O4-based nanozyme treatment attenuated inflammatory infiltration, preserved epithelial barrier integrity, and downregulated pyroptosis-related markers.

While a multitude of existing works offer optimal subsampling methods for conducting analyses on subsamples with minimized efficiency loss, they notably lack tools for judiciously selecting the subsample size. To bridge this gap, our work introduces tools designed for choosing the subsample size. We focus on three settings: the Cox regression model for survival data with rare events, and logistic regression for both balanced and imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we present a new optimal subsampling procedure tailored to logistic regression with imbalanced data. The efficacy of these tools and procedures is demonstrated through an extensive simulation study and meticulous analyses of two sizable datasets: survival analysis of UK Biobank colorectal cancer data with about 350 million rows and logistic regression of linked birth and infant death data with about 28 million observations.",

Establishing diagnostic cost is crucial to support policy development for equitable rare disease diagnosis. We estimated the cost and cost trajectory of diagnostic genome sequencing and bioinformatics for Indigenous participants with suspected rare diseases. We conducted a micro-costing study of Indigenous children and their families receiving genome sequencing through Canada's Silent Genomes Project. Invoice data informed the costs of genome sequencing. We conducted a time-and-motion study for bioinformatics analyses, including labor, computing, and data storage costs. With standard bioinformatics, costs ranged from C$3,645 (SD: 455) for singletons to C$7,402 (SD: 566) for trios. With advanced, bespoke bioinformatics, costs ranged from C$5,344 (SD: 634) for singletons to C$9,760 (SD: 822) for trios.

    "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a genetically diverse group of Mendelian disorders characterized by length-dependent axonal degeneration. Microtubule dysfunction is a known mechanism in HSP that impairs axonal dynamics. TBCB encodes Tubulin folding co-factor B (TBCB), which, along with TBCE, regulates αβ-heterodimer dynamics and neuronal axonal growth. Here, we describe a new form of complicated HSP caused by a founder variant in TBCB. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.589T>A p.(Tyr197Asn) variant in TBCB in a cohort of ten individuals assembled through genematching tools. Protein function was assessed using Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue ALF1, and a CRISPR-Cas9-generated homologous mutant in Drosophila melanogaster. TBCB expression and localization were examined in fibroblasts using western blot and immunofluorescence. Participants displayed late childhood onset spastic paraparesis, global developmental delay and autism spectrum. TBCB protein levels were reduced in affected fibroblasts. The ALF1 mutant in yeast increased benomyl sensitivity, resembling a loss-of-function phenotype. In Drosophila melanogaster, the homologous mutant led to reduced survival and impaired climbing ability. We describe a novel neurodevelopmental disorder with spastic paraparesis and a high carrier rate in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Our results indicate that TBCB has a vital role in CNS development and potentially in axonal function in humans.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide and claims roughly 700,000 lives each year; nearly 50% of global HCC fatalities occur in China. To conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis identifying predictors of sorafenib efficacy in combination with thermal ablation for HCC treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to October 2024, reviewing 720 identified studies. From these, 19 studies were selected that included a total of 3,341 participants with HCC at baseline. The meta-analysis examined the effects of sorafenib in combination with physical thermal ablation, using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Analyses were performed using two-sided methods and either fixed-effect or random-effects models, depending on the level of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis revealed that combining physical thermal ablation with sorafenib significantly improved outcomes in HCC patients: Overall survival (OS) was more than doubled (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.55-2.67; p < 0.001), recurrence rates were significantly reduced (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.39-0.98; p = 0.04), and overall treatment efficacy was markedly higher (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.61-3.96; p < 0.001) compared with thermal ablation alone. In individuals with HCC, physical thermal ablation and sorafenib had significantly higher OS, lower recurrence rates, and high overall efficacy compared to physical thermal ablation. To validate this discovery, more research is needed, and caution must be implemented when interacting with its values.",

    "abstract": "MiRNAs play crucial roles in cell proliferation, metabolism, and signal transduction, and have been established as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment for many years. Traditional methods for detecting miRNAs have several drawbacks, including poor sensitivity, time-consuming processes, and laborious steps. We have combined nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) with DNAzyme to develop a single-tube detection platform for highly sensitive and rapid detection of miRNA-21. The target miRNA activates NEAR to produce many single-stranded DNAs, which hybridize to another DNA strand in the system to form a cleavage-active magnesium ion-dependent DNAzyme. When magnesium ions are present in the system, DNAzyme degrades the FQ reporter to generate a fluorescent signal to achieve highly sensitive and rapid detection of miRNA. This assay enables highly sensitive detection of miRNAs with a detection limit of 1.91 pM. The assay is a one-tube reaction, and miRNA detection can be completed in approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. These results indicate that this biosensor has a broad application prospect in cancer diagnosis and treatment based on miRNA detection.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular zinc homeostasis and subcellular compartmentalization are exquisitely regulated, playing critical roles in immune regulation, such as inducing inflammatory programmed cell death, producing high levels of interferons and inflammatory cytokines, controlling the polarization and function of macrophages, etc. Herein, we designed two cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes with moderate zinc ion (Zn2+) affinity, capable of re-distributing the endogenous Zn2+ from the cytoplasm and vesicles to mitochondria as indicated by ICP-MS measurement, thus inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondria-targeted Ir2 also displayed better immunoregulation activity than lysosome-targeted Ir1, capable of triggering GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis via caspase-1 dependent pathway and down-regulating PD-L1 levels in cancer cells. In macrophages, Ir2 also re-distributed intracellular zinc effectively, leading to an increased zinc level in mitochondria and promoting the M0-to-M1 polarization of macrophages. The antitumor efficacy and immunoregulation activity were also verified in vivo. This work suggested that the modulation of endogenous zinc homeostasis both in cancer cells and immune cells would be a promising strategy for activating anti-tumour immunity, and provided new clues for designing novel metallodrugs for cancer chemo-immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis frequently occurs in patients with prostate cancer, however, a consensus has not been reached regarding bone scan image analysis. We aimed to analyse various bone scan imaging features of metastatic prostate cancer and to assess their impact on prognosis. One thousand five hundred sixty-three paired sets of bone scan images (anterior and posterior) were obtained from patients with metastatic prostate cancer at Seoul National University Hospital. U-Net architecture was used for the segmentation of metastatic bone lesions. Imaging features describing the overall metastatic burden (n = 18) and largest metastatic burden (n = 32) were extracted using computer vision techniques. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional risk model were used to analyse the prognostic impact of each feature. The correlation coefficient between the actual number of lesions and that predicted by the deep learning model was 0.87, indicating a strong correlation. Multivariate Cox regression showed that metastasis intensity difference (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; P = 0.002) and the largest metastasis percentage (HR, 0.62; P = 0.038) were independently associated with disease progression and were even more strongly associated with the number of metastases (current standard). The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that a higher total metastasis ratio (P < 0.001), a lower total metastasis intensity difference (P = 0.030), a lower largest metastatic lesion percentage (P < 0.001), higher compactness (P = 0.028), and lower eccentricity (P = 0.070) were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Although the number of bone metastases is a standardised prognostic factor, additional consideration of morphological or intensity-related novel features may be useful to more accurately predict the prognosis of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "We describe the immunophenotyping and genetic analysis of HIV-uninfected apparently immunocompetent adults presenting with disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococci are environmentally ubiquitous fungi that may cause disseminated infection including meningitis. Cryptococcosis occurs predominantly in immunocompromised hosts and most commonly in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In apparently immunocompetent patients, cryptococcal disease is rare, often diagnosed later and associated with higher mortality. The immunologic work-up and management of this patient group is challenging and poorly studied. Between 2015-2021, eight apparently immunocompetent adults at the time of diagnosis with cryptococcosis underwent extensive diagnostic immunological work-up including T-/B-cell subsets, immunoglobulins, T-cell proliferation and phenotyping, serum-specific antibody responses, mannose binding lectin, measurement of selected cytokines, anti-cytokine autoantibodies and targeted genetic next-generation sequencing. The production of interleukin (IL)-17 following phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was significantly reduced in all eight patients with cryptococcosis compared to healthy controls (median IL-17 concentration in whole blood stimulation assay 88.1pg/mL in patients; 452.1pg/mL in controls, p=0.0047). In 5/5 patients tested, the percentage of CD4+ T-cells positive for IL-17, including memory CD4+CD45RO+ IL-17+ T-cells, after stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) was significantly reduced (<=0.4% cells). Reduced IgM+ memory B-cells were noted in 4/5 tested. 4/8 patients were found to have CD4 lymphopaenia. One patient with Cryptococcus gattii infection had autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). No underlying genetic causes were identified. Patients had several immunological risk factors, but reduced IL-17 production was a striking feature across the cohort - a phenotype that may facilitate tailored immunotherapeutic approaches.Graphical Abstract.",

However, the excessively wide bandgap of inorganic sonosensitizers and the easy recombination of electron-hole pairs limit the yield of ROS of sonosensitizers. Herein, for the first time, we report carbon dot (CD)-sensitized hollow Co9S8-x as a novel inorganic sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic tumor therapy. The presence of sulfur vacancies endows Co9S8 with excellent sonodynamic and chemodynamic activities. Furthermore, CDs with good sonodynamic activity are utilized to form CD@Co9S8-x heterojunctions with hollow Co9S8-x, realizing the cascaded amplification of the ROS yield. The significantly increased ROS level induces a powerful effect of cell apoptosis, thus completely eradicating tumors. Overall, this work delivers useful insights for utilizing vacancy engineering and heterojunction engineering to achieve enhanced sonodynamic tumor therapy.",

In this study, we propose a nanoplatform (CuS@GOx@ES) that integrates chemodynamic therapy (CDT), starvation therapy (ST), photothermal therapy (PTT), and copper-induced toxicity for enhanced cancer treatment. CuS nanoparticles, with their large surface area, are ideal for CDT, while glucose oxidase (GOx) depletes tumor glucose for ST and catalyzes H2O2 production for a Fenton-like reaction. The glucose depletion generates gluconic acid, which accelerates CuS degradation and Cu2+ release, enhancing both CDT and copper-induced toxicity. CuS also exhibits excellent photothermal properties and enhances PTT under 808 nm NIR irradiation. The increased temperature further amplifies the effects of CDT and copper-induced toxicity. Additionally, CuS serves as an exogenous source of copper, releasing Cu2+ into the tumor microenvironment (TME), where it binds to the copper ion carrier ES for targeted delivery to tumor cells, inducing copper-induced toxicity and tumor cell death. The CuS@GOx@ES nanoplatform effectively combines CDT, PTT, ST, and copper-induced toxicity, creating a synergistic effect where the treatments enhance each other to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes.",

These patients often present with malignant ascites and are prone to significant fluid shifts perioperatively. For this reason, our objective was to define clinical targets for optimal fluid balance and determine whether initial ascites should be included in fluid-loss calculations by examining the association between perioperative fluid balance and major postoperative complications. This prospective, observational study conducted in a centralized and public healthcare system setting in Sweden between 2020 and 2023 included patients with advanced ovarian cancer, > 18 years of age, scheduled for upfront cytoreductive surgery, an ASA physical status I-III with no speech/language issues. The primary outcome was major postoperative complication within 30 days of surgery. The measurements of fluid input and output, cut-offs for fluid balance, perioperative time, and postoperative complications were defined a priori. The association between fluid balance and major postoperative complications was assessed by multivariable regression, adjusted for predefined covariates, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Of 175 enrolled patients, 162 were included in the final analysis. In the adjusted analysis, there was a significant association between fluid balance of 1750-2700 mL, OR 3.40 (95% CI 1.06-10.9; p = 0.04) and > 2700 mL, OR 3.91 (95% CI 1.33-11.5; p = 0.01) and major postoperative complications. When including initial ascites as fluid loss, a balance of > 2700 mL was associated with major postoperative complications, OR 2.59 (95% CI 1.01-6.66, p = 0.047). An optimal target for perioperative fluid balance to decrease the odds of major postoperative complications is suggested to be < 1750 mL. If initial ascites is included as loss in the calculation of balance, the optimal target of fluid balance is suggested to be < 2700 mL. These results provide practical clinical reference values that may assist anesthesiologists and surgical teams in optimizing perioperative fluid management in advanced ovarian cancer. This secondary analysis of a trial ovarian cancer operative cohort assessed the relation of the estimated fluid balance over the operative day 24 h to major postoperative complications. The findings showed that the groups where the fluid balance was in the categories higher and also most positive had higher odds for having a major complication compared to the group with lowest fluid balance. Ascities fluid was an issue in this cohort, which was managed in the analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04065009.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) systematically orchestrate multiple biological processes via gene regulation in various organisms. Conventionally, miRNAs bind to untranslated regions of mRNAs to modulate gene silencing in the cytoplasm. Recent studies have revealed that a subset of miRNAs located in the nucleus can efficiently activate gene transcription by targeting enhancers, named as Nuclear Activating miRNAs (NamiRNAs). The fundamental principle of this regulatory pattern is that NamiRNAs as \"wedges\" open double strands of genomic DNA and provide the prerequisite for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Specifically, NamiRNAs bind to their target enhancers and form the hybrids of miRNAs and single-stranded DNA, which are recognized by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to maintain the single-stranded state. Meanwhile, AGO2 protects these miRNA-DNA hybrids from RNase H-mediated degradation to maintain their stability. Additionally, NamiRNAs induce H3K27ac enrichment at target enhancers and put them into an active state conducive to gene activation. Notably, similar to NamiRNAs, Human Identical Sequences as exogenous small RNAs as critical pathogenic factors for RNA viruses, facilitate infectious disease progression. Collectively, this review systematically elucidates the theory of NamiRNA-Enhancer-mediated Gene Activation in combination with corresponding evidence, summarizes the functions and challenges of NamiRNAs, and discusses their potential in fundamental research and clinical applications.",

Effective first-line targeted therapies are crucial for improving outcomes, particularly when combined with second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies.

A retrospective analysis of Taiwanese data (2013-2019) included patients with KRAS wild-type unresectable mCRC who received first-line cetuximab+FOLFIRI or bevacizumab+FOLFIRI, followed by second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Survival outcomes-overall survival (OS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD)-were compared between these regimens using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for potential confounders, followed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to account for clinical and biological variables. In patients without PTR, first-line cetuximab+FOLFIRI with second-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved OS from the start dates of first- and second-line treatment compared to first-line bevacizumab+FOLFIRI with second-line oxaliplatin-based therapy, yielding adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.78) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42-0.73), respectively.

A survey was conducted among 77 members of the Korean Society of Coloproctology and 25 members of the Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The survey assessed decision-making regarding additional surgery after endoscopic resection for high-risk T1 colorectal cancer according to various predicted LNM rates (3%, 10%, and 27%) and tumor locations (anal verge [AV] 2, 7, and 25 cm). Additionally, participants provided feedback regarding the reliability, usefulness, and potential adoptability of the prediction model in patient counseling. Of the 2,314 surveys distributed, 102 responses were analyzed. A trend was observed in which tumors located closer to the anus and associated with a lower predicted risk of LNM were less likely to lead respondents to opt for surgery (e.g., AV 2 cm and 3% of predicted LNM risk, 21.6% opt for surgery vs. AV 25 cm and 27% of predicted LNM risk, 98.0% opt for surgery).

The purpose of this study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of a VTE prophylaxis program using the Caprini score in elderly patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal cancer surgery with the ERAS protocol. This retrospective cross-sectional study included 1,043 colorectal cancer patients requiring surgery from January 2017 to December 2019, divided into a control group (≤75 years) and an elderly group (>75 years), with 827 and 216 patients, respectively. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE; secondary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications, particularly bleeding. The incidence of VTE was 1.5% in the control group and 3.7% in the elderly group (P=0.061). Five patients (0.5%) experienced symptomatic VTE, and the Caprini score for all VTE patients was ≤8 points; thus, only mechanical prophylaxis was used. In the multivariable logistic regression, the Caprini score (P=0.024) and cancer stage (P=0.004) were selected. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the Caprini score and TNM staging were 1.758 (1.078-2.867) and 6.152 (2.045-26.510), respectively. When the ERAS protocol was used for patients with colorectal cancer as perioperative care, the VTE risk was lower than that estimated by the Caprini score. Given that age is a recognized risk factor for major bleeding, criteria for the use of anticoagulation to prevent VTE, particularly in elderly patients, should be carefully evaluated, considering both the bleeding risks and the potential benefits of pharmacologic prophylaxis.

The liver is a commonly damaged organ during sepsis and also an important organ for releasing acute response proteins. However, whether pyroptosis occurs and the function of GSDMD in hepatocytes remains unclear. It is surprising to find that hepatocyte-specific GSDMD knockout (GSDMDhep-/-) mice have significantly reduced survival rates, markedly elevated systemic inflammation, and increased inflammation in the peritoneal cavity and lungs, suggesting that the absence of GSDMD in hepatocytes promotes systemic inflammatory responses. Serum proteomic analysis shows that anti-inflammatory factors such as VEGF-B and Gremlin-1 are significantly reduced in GSDMDhep-/- mice. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments combined with a constructed full-length GSDMD and a mutant GSDMD plasmid (GSDMD-c.D276A) that cannot be cleaved, VEGF-B and Gremlin-1 are verified to be released from hepatocytes through the pore-forming activity of GSDMD, thus inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors by macrophages. More importantly, hepatocyte-specific replenishment of full-length GSDMD can reverse the exacerbated inflammatory response in GSDMDhep-/- mice. These findings together establish that hepatic GSDMD plays a key protective role in sepsis by promoting the release of anti-inflammatory factors through pore formation in hepatocytes.",

However, the extent of changes in coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores postradiation and the influencing factors remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated studies investigating changes in CAC scores following breast cancer radiation therapy. Data abstraction was independently performed by two unblinded reviewers using structured collection forms, with no divergences in data collection. The nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scoring system assessed methodological quality. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Among eight studies (1972 patients), radiation doses ranged from 47 to 60 Grays. The overall rate of CAC score increase or new appearance postradiation was 25.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21.3-30.8%]. The rate was significantly higher after left-sided radiation at 32.3% (95% CI, 25.7-39.6%) compared to 16.1% (95% CI, 5.8-37.3%) for right-sided radiation. CAC score development occurs in approximately one-quarter of breast cancer patients after radiation therapy, with a significantly higher risk following left-sided radiation. These findings underscore the need for tailored monitoring strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks in this population.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and the Western Pacific, is regulated by type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, in which STAT2 is critical. However, STAT2's exact role in JEV-mediated IFN evasion remains unclear. Existing murine models of JEV infection predominantly employ high viral titers to induce encephalitis and primarily use immunocompetent or IFN receptor-deficient mice, limiting their utility for studying JEV's IFN evasion mechanisms. To address this, we developed a humanized STAT2 mouse model (NCG-hSTAT2+/+) and infected it with 10³ PFU of JEV-p3. These mice exhibited severe encephalitis resembling clinical human infections, characterized by elevated viral loads, and increased proinflammatory cytokines. Especially, it presents typical neurological symptoms, such as activated astrocytes and distinct neuropathological changes. This suggests that NCG-hSTAT2+/+ mice exhibit higher susceptibility to JEV and more severe neurological symptoms, which is consistent with that observed in clinical patients exhibited. This model significantly advances the study of JEV pathogenesis, therapeutic evaluation, and understanding of human STAT2's role in neuroinvasion and immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) nanoparticles are widely used to transport therapeutic agents to cancer sites and rapidly release them owing to their rapid biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of these DMOS nanoparticles as nanocarriers is limited, and their applications remain relatively simple. In this study, Fe3+-doped dendritic mesoporous organosilica (Fe-DMOS) nanoparticles are designed as a new type of ferroptosis inducer and are combined with sodium hyaluronate-modified calcium peroxide to form TME-responsive nanocomposites. The nanocomposites can effectively generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction between the released Fe3+ and self-compensated hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial injury caused by Ca2+ overload further promotes this process. Both Fe3+ and disulfide bonds can induce glutathione depletion, thus downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 and triggering lethal levels of lipid peroxidation products, further facilitating ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the ferroptosis-mediated process of immunogenic cell death promotes a long-term antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis of tumor cells with the assistance of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1). Fe-DMOS nanoparticles are synthesized with ferroptosis-inducing capabilities and established TME-responsive nanocomposites combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor to effectively improve tumor immunotherapy.",

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) xenograft models, this dual-ligand nanoprobe can help achieve a four-fivefold increase in the tumor signal over the background. Notably, the previously unexplored relationship between tumor stiffness and RTP emission is studied. Mechanical and histological analyses confirmed increased stiffness in OSCC tissues. By modulating the rigidity of tumor phantoms and treating the xenografts with collagenase, a direct correlation is revealed between tumor stiffness and phosphorescence intensity. This study suggests the effectiveness of dual targeting in improving tumor visualization using guest-host-doped RTP nanoprobes. The findings demonstrate that the biomechanical features of the tumor microenvironment enhance phosphorescence emission, highlighting tumor stiffness as a natural amplifier for RTP imaging.",

Our objective was to identify on-pack claims displayed on commercial foods for infants and toddlers in New Zealand. The packaging of products intended for infants (aged up to 11 months) and toddlers (ages 12 months to <36 months) was analyzed for the presence of claims using a coding structure based on categories outlined by the World Health Organization Europe Nutrient and Promotion Profile Model. Descriptive statistics were conducted to analyze the frequency of types of claims. Relevant infant and toddler products available in New Zealand supermarkets were identified through a packaged food database of products collected in 2023. Two hundred and ten products were identified: 167 infant and 43 toddler products.

    "abstract": "Melanoma presents as an increasingly prevalent and intricate skin cancer, characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment that features various mutations and the activation of melanogenesis pathways. Dynamic changes within this microenvironment, including increased ROS levels, acidity, and enzyme expression, specifically upregulation of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and MMP2, amongst other enzymes, further contribute to its complexity. Despite advancements in melanoma treatment and FDA approval of therapies targeting specific pathways and employing immune checkpoint inhibitors, challenges persist in melanoma treatment, particularly in optimizing drug delivery and navigating the intricate tumor microenvironment. Recent research has increasingly focused on integrating biomaterials into melanoma treatment, yielding promising results. These biomaterials find application in melanoma diagnosis, treatment, and imaging. Studies have sparked interest in uncovering the therapeutic potential of stimuli-responsive biomaterials. pH-responsive systems offer the prospect of targeted drug release in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, light- and temperature-responsive materials offer spatiotemporal control, aiding melanoma death processes such as necroptosis, apoptosis, and necrosis. Biomaterials responsive to ROS and enzymes address the intricacies of melanoma biology, enhancing treatment specificity. Additionally, multiple stimuli-responsive platforms present a holistic approach for heightened therapeutic efficacy. This review navigates the intricate terrain of melanoma treatment, addressing current therapy limitations and envisioning a future where functionalized biomaterials are pivotal in more effective and targeted interventions. We evaluate multifaceted approaches harnessing distinct biological, physical, and chemical stimuli, and their synergistic combinations to enhance drug delivery precision and other mechanisms in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Earlier we showed that JMJD6 interacted with HOTAIR promoter (-123 to -103 bp, termed JIR) and for maximal induction, an additional (-216 to -123 bp) region was required. In silico prediction and ENCODE data from MCF7 cells showed YBX1 peaks in this region (YIR). Publicly available mass spectrometry data of proteins following JMJD6 immunoprecipitation identified YBX1 as an interacting partner. In this study, we validate JMJD6-YBX1 interaction in breast cancer cell lines using co-immunoprecipitation assays with recombinant, endogenous and in vitro synthesized proteins. Domain mapping using deletion constructs revealed that A/P domain of YBX1 interacted with JMJC domain of JMJD6. These proteins also positively regulated each other's expression in breast cancer cell lines. Further, YBX1 augmented luciferase activity of HOTAIR promoter constructs, pHP216 and pHP123, in MCF7, Vec and JMJD6 overexpressing (JOE) cells. siRNA mediated depletion, mutation of YIR region or knocking out YBX1 (YKO cells) diminished luciferase activity. ChIP and ChIP-re-ChIP assays verified co-occupancy of both proteins in the HOTAIR promoter region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed complex formation with YIR and JIR probes. Mutation of YIR region and YKO resulted in loss of complex formation with both probes. Taken together these data imply that YBX1 is crucial for physically recruiting JMJD6 to HOTAIR promoter. Their interaction and positive feed forward loop perpetuated by JMJD6 and YBX1 inter-regulation culminates in HOTAIR induction, which in turn, is known to drive tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for imaging lipids, proteins, N-glycans, metabolites, and drugs in situ. A key step in MALDI MSI is matrix deposition, which must balance the extraction of molecules from the surface of the tissue without inducing excessive analyte delocalization. Further, MALDI MSI spatial resolution is limited by the size of the matrix crystals formed during matrix deposition. Minimizing crystal size is paramount to obtaining detailed images and refined data. Sublimation has been shown to be a reliable method of depositing matrix while minimizing crystal size. Since sublimation does not use any solvents to deposit the matrix, it is also theorized to minimize analyte delocalization. However, these same solvents are thought to aid in analyte extraction, which may limit detection by sublimation. In this study, we compared crystal size, analyte delocalization, and signal intensity differences when using a commercial automatic pneumatic sprayer and a sublimator for lipid imaging analyses. We tested three matrices: α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) on mouse brain, heart, and kidney. Our results revealed that crystal size depended upon the matrix and whether the crystals formed on or off tissue. Our data also showed that only a subset of the lipid spectrum was susceptible to increased delocalization from spraying and decreased signal intensity from sublimation.",

However, most of these transporters cause harm to healthy cells as well, limiting their applicability in real biological systems. Here, we report a pyrrole-linked benzimidazolyl-hydrazone that self-assembles to form a nanochannel assembly across the lipid bilayer, enabling the selective translocation of HCl, a system rarely reported in the literature. The channel shows an extraordinarily high HCl transport activity with an EC50 value as low as 0.016 mol%, relative to lipid. We demonstrate solid-state evidence that compound 1 self-assembles in the presence of HCl to produce organized arrays that include chloride-filled and water-filled channels. The formation of a stable HCl channel across the lipid bilayer membrane was verified through electrophysiological experiments, detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. When tested in cellular systems, the compound showed pronounced toxicity toward cancerous cell lines while remaining relatively nontoxic to cell lines of non-cancerous origin. Interestingly, compound 1 was also found to inhibit the growth and proliferation of MCF-7-derived 3D spheroids with higher efficiency when compared to the commercially available anticancer drug─doxorubicin (DOX).",

Finding gastric cancer biomarkers is essential to comprehending its pathophysiology and creating novel targeted treatments. Following the acquisition and processing of the gastric cancer sample, the single-cell RNA sequencing data, monocyte subpopulation characterization, and cell type identification were performed. Key gene modules linked to gastric-cancer-related monocytes were identified using high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Machine-learning diagnostic models were created utilizing the discovered gastric-cancer-related monocyte-related genes (GCRMORGs). A prognostic model was developed with the uridine phosphatase 1 (UPP1)-related risk scores and verified in separate cohorts, and multiple immunological analyses were performed. Finally, using various experimental assays, we thoroughly investigated the function of the UPP1 gene in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer samples showed a distinct immune milieu topography with an abundance of monocytes. Eventually, 32 GCRMORGs were identified. Diagnostic models demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in differentiating between patients with gastric cancer and the control group. The prognostic model showed significant predictive value for gastric cancer patients' survival. At the same time, we have confirmed from experimental perspectives that a poor prognosis for patients is indicated by a high expression of UPP1 in gastric cancer tissue. Important monocyte subpopulations associated with gastric cancer samples were detected in our investigation. The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer can be predicted using a predictive model based on 32 GCRMORGs.

We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of MYC expression in breast cancer among adolescents and young adults. MYC expression in 42 adolescents and young adults and 110 older adults were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical c-myc expression was higher in adolescents and young adults group compared to older adults, without MYC gene amplification. In older adults, c-myc expression was associated with more aggressive features. Adolescents and young adults group showed higher c-myc expression even in tumors with less aggressive features, such as estrogen receptor positive, low Ki-67 labeling index, and early clinical stage, than older adults. RNA sequencing revealed higher expression of cholecystokinin B receptor and lower expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2 family member B4 in c-myc positive tumors of adolescents and young adults group. The preference of positive cases for both c-myc and cholecystokinin B receptor was significantly higher in adolescents and young adults group.

Patient studies were partitioned into training (DTr) and hold-out test set (DTe). Three hundred radiomic features quantifying textural patterns were extracted from radiologist delineated PCa regions of interest (ROI) on biparametric MRI. Features with significant differences (P < .05) between clinically significant (csPCa) and insignificant (ciPCa) PCa were identified. Machine learning models were trained separately for AA and W men (CAA, CW) on DTr to distinguish csPCa and ciPCa. Validation on DTe was assessed for AUC and compared against a population agnostic model (CPA) in combination with clinical parameters (age, PSA, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Diagnostic System and tumor volume). Radiomic features from PCa ROIs on biparametric MRI associated with csPCa were observed to be different in AA compared with W men, especially in the peritumoral region.

Here, we present a pluripotent-stem-cell-based 3D ectodermal organoid model that faithfully recapitulates early ectodermal patterning of future central nervous system, epidermis and cranial and trunk NC, as well as a diverse selection of NC derivatives -offering a comprehensive platform to study neurocristopathies from early induction of pluripotent-like stem cells at the neural plate border to differentiated cells. DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion of ∼fifty genes, many of which play broad roles during embryogenesis. While DGS is traditionally considered to originate from all germ layers, its clinical manifestations-including craniofacial anomalies, cardiac outflow tract defects, thymic hypoplasia and thyroid dysfunction-are consistent with tissues requiring NC contributions. This raises the question why DGS mainly manifest in organs of NC origin? Using patient-derived iPSCs, we show that DGS organoids display reduced pluripotency gene expression and impaired maintenance of ectodermal stem cells, leading to defective NC specification, posteriorization of cranial NC, and failure to form cartilage. We identify a small subset of genes within the DGS deletion as potential drivers of these early NC defects. Consequently, impaired NC cells are further affected during cranial and vagal mesenchyme maturation, likely worsened by hemizygosity of additional DGS genes that individually, without the initial NC defect, are insufficient to cause the disease.

We used the 2012-2020 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality improvement Program data on patients who underwent colectomies for colon cancer. Functional dependence was either independent, partially/totally dependent, or unknown. Surgical approaches were either MIS or open. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the data and used a counterfactual approach to assess the differences in predicted rates of outcome for open vs. MIS surgery. 2.7% of 115,897 patients were partially/totally dependent. While 64.5% of all patients received MIS, among those who were partially/totally dependent only 49.7% received MIS. No difference existed in discharge destination or readmission rate by surgical approach among patients who were partially/totally dependent (p = 0.384 and p = 0.168, respectively). Using the counterfactual approach, performing MIS rather than open surgery among patients who were partially/totally dependent would lower 30-day mortality by 27.3% (relative reduction).

    "abstract": "Anopheles gambiae is a primary malaria vector mosquito in Africa. RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis has been widely used to study gene expressions underlying mosquito life traits such as development, reproduction, immunity, metabolism, and behavior. While it is widely appreciated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed ubiquitously in transcriptomes across metazoans, lncRNAs remain relatively underexplored in An. gambiae, including their identity, expression profiles, and biological functions. The lncRNA genes were poorly annotated in the current reference of the PEST genome of An. gambiae. In this study, a set of publicly available RNA-seq datasets was leveraged to identify lncRNAs across diverse contexts, including whole mosquitoes, mosquito cells or tissues including hemocytes, midguts, and salivary glands, as well as under different physiological conditions including sugar-feeding, blood-feeding, bacterial challenges, and Plasmodium infections. A Transcript Discovery module implemented in CLC genomics workbench was used to identify lncRNAs from selected published RNA-seq datasets. Across this pool of transcriptomes, 2684 unique lncRNA genes, comprising 4082 transcripts, were identified. Following their identification, these lncRNA genes were integrated into the mosquito transcriptome annotation, which was then used as a reference to analyze both mRNAs and lncRNAs for transcriptional dynamics in different conditions. Unsurprisingly and similar to what has been reported for mRNAs, lncRNAs exhibited context-dependent expression patterns. Co-expression networks constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted the interconnections among lncRNAs and mRNAs, which provides potential functional networks in which these lncRNAs are involved. Furthermore, we identified polysome-associated lncRNAs within polysome-captured transcripts, suggesting the involvement of lncRNAs in translation regulation and coding capacity for micropeptides. The analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset unveiled a correlation of transcriptional activities between lncRNAs and observed epigenetic signatures. Overall, our study demonstrated that lncRNAs are transcribed alongside mRNAs in various biological contexts. The genome-wide annotation of lncRNA genes and integration into the PEST reference genome enables the co-analysis of mRNA and lncRNA simultaneously, which will enhance our understanding of their functions, shedding light on their regulatory roles in An. gambiae biology.",

    "title": "Implantable and injectable drug delivery systems for pain management.",
    "abstract": "Pain is a widespread global health issue, significantly affecting quality of life and contributing to disability. It is estimated that between 20% and 30% of the global population suffer from some form of non-cancer chronic pain. Around 80% of surgical patients report postoperative acute pain, with less than 50% achieving adequate pain control. Despite these statistics, the management of pain still remains a significant challenge for clinicians, with many patients experiencing poorly controlled pain or adverse effects related to analgesic medication. This literature review outlines current pain management strategies, focusing on non-oral postoperative pain therapies, including injectable drug delivery systems (such as in situ forming implants, micro- and nano-based formulations) and implantable drug delivery systems. Emphasis is placed on solid implantable devices designed for sustained drug delivery, which can offer more efficient localized drug delivery at the pain site. While pharmacological treatments, including oral opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are commonly used, implantable controlled release systems are emerging as more effective alternatives. These systems provide localized pain relief with reduced systemic exposure, minimizing side effects, opioid use, and the risk of addiction, offering a promising solution for improved postoperative pain management.",

    "title": "Wildfire Exposure and Respiratory Health: A Comprehensive Review of Emerging Evidence.",
    "abstract": "In January 2025, a devastating wildfire in Los Angeles, California, caused massive economic damage and posed a significant threat to public respiratory health. As climate change accelerates, the frequency and intensity of wildfires have raised significant global concern due to their profound impact on respiratory health. Wildfire smoke contains high concentrations of ambient air pollutants, particularly particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3) and various toxic compounds. Among these, wildfire-related PM is particularly harmful due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, triggering more oxidative and inflammatory response, and contribute to the onset and exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies show that short-term exposure to wildfire smoke has been associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and pneumonia, resulting in increased mortality and healthcare utilization. Long-term exposure may contribute to the development and progression of COPD and is potentially associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and mortality. These findings highlight the serious threat it poses to both individual and public health, contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, and associated socio-economic costs. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent research on the respiratory health effects associated with wildfire smoke exposure. By presenting these findings, this review aims to inform healthcare professionals and public health policymakers, facilitating evidence-based strategies for clinical care, public health education, and disaster preparedness in the light of growing threat posed by wildfires.",

    "title": "Contrasting effects of ethylene and propylene linkers on the kinetic stability of water-soluble near-infrared-absorbing diradical-PtII complexes.",
    "abstract": "Diradical-PtII complexes with o-phenylenediamine ligands exhibit intense near-infrared (NIR) absorption, making them applicable as photothermal agents for cancer imaging and therapy. However, their NIR-absorbing properties can be deactivated by ligand exchange with cellular substances such as glutathione (GSH). To improve the kinetic stability of diradical-PtII complexes, we synthesized two novel tetradentate ligands, 4,4'-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(azanediyl))bis(3-aminobenzenesulfonate) (EABS) and 4,4'-(propane-1,3-diylbis(azanediyl))bis(3-aminobenzenesulfonate) (PABS), in which two 3,4-diaminobenzenesulfonate (DABS) units are connected by an ethylene or propylene linker, respectively. Contrary to the expectation that the resulting chelate ring will enhance stability, [Pt(EABS)]2- readily released its linker to form [Pt(DABS)2]2- owing to its bent and twisted coordination structure. In contrast, [Pt(PABS)]2- was stable owing to its less distorted structure and exhibited an intense absorption peak at 723 nm (8.7 × 104 M-1 cm-1) in aqueous solution. Kinetic analysis of the ligand exchange reaction with GSH showed that the half-life of [Pt(PABS)]2- under intracellular conditions ([GSH] = 1.0 × 10-2 M) is 27 h, approximately 1300 and 16 000 times longer than those of [Pt(DABS)2]2- (72 s) and [Pt(EABS)]2- (5.9 s), respectively. Thus, the linker chain length significantly influences molecular structure and kinetic stability against GSH, with the propylene linker effectively enhancing the stability of diradical-PtII complexes. Additionally, ligand oxidation gradually extinguished the NIR absorption of aqueous [Pt(PABS)]2-, which would prevent unpredictable photothermal damage to healthy tissues after treatment. The ligand design of [Pt(PABS)]2- is expected to enable efficient imaging and therapy for cancer with minimal side effects.",

    "abstract": "This MRI-based study investigates factors influencing and predictors of margin status in neoadjuvant therapy followed by patients with breast-conserving surgery (NAT-BCS) and evaluates associated locoregional/distant control outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 117 consecutive patients with breast cancer (BC) who underwent NAT-BCS between June 2014 and June 2024. All patients received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations both before and after NAT. Univariate analysis identified factors influencing surgical margin status as molecular subtype (with HER2+ showing the lowest positive rate, followed sequentially by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), Luminal B HER2+, Luminal A, and Luminal B HER2-), nonmass enhancement (NME) on pre-NAT MRI, axillary lymph node metastasis, post-NAT MRI shrinkage pattern, postoperative pathological complete response (pCR) status, pN status, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI); however, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only LVI independently affected margin status, and NME on pre-NAT MRI independently predicted margin status, with 106 patients ultimately undergoing BCS, exhibiting a locoregional recurrence (LRR) rate of 1.9% (2/106) and a distant metastasis (DM) rate of 2.8% (3/106). The presence of NME on pre-NAT MRI could be a predictor for margin status, possibly informing surgical strategy formulation. Concurrently, LVI might represent a distinct determinant influencing margin outcomes. NAT-BCS therapy has achieved favorable local-regional and distant control outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A person-centered outcomes-based quality improvement program is lacking within palliative care in Mainland China. The well-established Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) national model improves palliative care quality. This study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators perceived by healthcare providers to integrating the PCOC model in a Chinese hospital-based palliative care unit. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured focus group and individual interviews. A rapid deductive analysis approach was selected for data analysis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework was used to guide the study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Eighteen healthcare professionals participated in this study, four focus group interviews and five individual interviews were completed. Barriers to the PCOC integration included clinical application and workload concerns (patients in terminal stage, patients' dialects, workload concerns, and staff shortages); attitudinal barriers (negative attitudes toward PCOC); psychological barriers (numbness to their work) and barriers related to knowledge and self-efficacy (lack of knowledge, capacity, and self-efficacy in palliative care). Facilitators included adapting the program to local contexts, ongoing education and feedback, effective PCOC data use, a supportive work and clinical environment and staff's perceived advantages of the model across clinical, research and process domains. The successful integration of the PCOC program hinges on local adaptation, improved data utilization, education, and IT support. In regions with less developed palliative care, enhancing professionals' knowledge and self-efficacy is crucial. Incorporating assessment and clinical response protocols into technology can accelerate palliative care development and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) is a rare, autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in NR2F1, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, optic nerve anomalies, and autism spectrum disorder. Most pathogenic variants cluster within the highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) or ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR2F1 and are associated with variable clinical severity, suggesting a genotype-phenotype correlation. While previous mouse models have provided important insights, comprehensive behavioral characterization remains limited. Here, we present two novel BBSOAS mouse models harboring patient-specific variants in the DBD (Nr2f1+/R139L) and LBD (Nr2f1+/E397*), alongside the established Nr2f1+/- model. We analyzed both brain morphology and behavior to further expand the murine phenotype and investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation. We demonstrate that these models recapitulate key aspects of the BBSOAS phenotype, including deficits in cognition, social communication, and motor function, and that the presence and severity of behavioral abnormalities are dependent on variant type. Our findings provide new evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation associated with domain-specific NR2F1 variants and establish a robust platform for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "Iron, as an essential element, plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper functioning of all living organisms. While the appropriate level of iron for the optimal functioning of organisms cannot be disregarded, an excessive amount of this element can be detrimental and give rise to various issues. Nonetheless, the condition of iron accumulation is exceedingly uncommon in the majority of individuals due to the presence of biological autoregulation systems. However, in certain genetic disorders, such as β - thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, and others, the nature of the diseases or treatment procedures can lead to an overload of iron. Furthermore, numerous studies have substantiated the role of iron in exacerbating conditions in some non-iron-dependent disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, malaria, and microbial infections. For the past few decades, iron-chelating agents have been employed to enhance the quality of life for patients with iron accumulation conditions. This review attempts to express the importance of natural and artificial iron chelating agents, as well as the necessity of their extraction, production, and use in vital situations. It also provides a brief overview of the paths pursued by researchers in these fields to introduce suitable compounds as practical iron scavengers for entry into the pharmaceutical market.",

This study aimed to identify prognostic factors that can help make informed decisions regarding surgical resection in elderly patients with BM. We retrospectively included elderly patients (65 years or older) with newly diagnosed BM who underwent surgery. We conducted survival analyses and Cox regression analyses to identify potential independent predictors of poor survival. A total of 124 elderly patients with BM undergoing surgical resection were enrolled. In the multivariate analysis, male sex (HR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.22-3.13), ECM (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.82-4.85), BM in eloquent locations (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64), KPS deterioration (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.20-3.10), and mFI-5 equal to or greater than 2 (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.12-3.95) were associated with poor overall survival. Conversely, receiving systemic treatment after the diagnosis of BM showed a significant overall survival benefit (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28-0.70). Elevated SII (HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.02-3.90) was significantly associated with poor survival, while elevated PNI (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33-0.94) indicated better survival. Clinicians should adopt a personalized approach when selecting treatment options for elderly patients with BM, considering BM location, the presence of ECM, comorbidities, and suitability for postoperative systemic treatment.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib (OSI) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a significant challenge. This report explored the precise role of USP28 on OSI resistance in NSCLC and identified a functional downstream effector. OSI-resistant H1975 cells (H1975/OSI) were established by long-term OSI exposure. USP28 and SIRT1 expression levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays included cell viability, colony formation, EdU incorporation, apoptosis analysis, and glycolysis assays. The interaction between USP28 and SIRT1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay and SIRT1 protein stability analysis. In vivo validation was performed using H1975/OSI xenograft models. USP28 and SIRT1 were upregulated in H1975/OSI cells and OSI-resistant NSCLC tissues. USP28 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation and glycolysis, suppressed apoptosis, and conferred OSI resistance in H1975 cells, while its depletion exerted opposite effects in H1975/OSI cells. Mechanistically, USP28 stabilized SIRT1 by deubiquitination. SIRT1 knockdown attenuated the effects of USP28 overexpression, while SIRT1 restoration reversed the phenotype alterations upon USP28 depletion. In vivo, USP28 depletion sensitized H1975/OSI xenografts to OSI treatment. Our study indicates that USP28 promotes OSI resistance in NSCLC by deubiquitinating SIRT1. Targeting the USP28/SIRT1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach to overcome OSI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "A potential association between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric atrophy (GA) has been reported. However, most published studies have used case-control designs, leading to selection bias. This study aimed to investigate the causal association between ESCC and GA using a nationwide cohort. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on consecutive participants who underwent endoscopy at 17 health check-up institutes in Japan between 2013 and 2017, with at least one follow-up endoscopy by December 2022. GA was evaluated endoscopically and classified into atrophy-free, closed-type, and open-type GA. The association between ESCC incidence and GA was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Among 33,461 participants, 17,398 (52.0%), 8257 (24.7%), and 7804 (23.3%) were classified into atrophy-free, closed-type GA, and open-type GA, respectively. Seventy-seven ESCCs were identified during a median 6-year follow-up period. The incidence of ESCC was 24 cases (0.024%/year) in the atrophy-free group, 15 cases (0.031%/year) in the closed-type GA group, and 38 cases (0.089%/year) in the open-type GA group, with a significantly higher incidence observed in the open-type GA group (p < 0.001). After adjusting for established risk factors (e.g., age, sex, drinking, and smoking), open-type GA, but not closed-type GA, was an independent risk factor for ESCC (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.58-4.69). This Japanese nationwide cohort study provides new evidence suggesting a causal association between extensive GA and the subsequent development of ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Oral delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics for cancer therapy encounters major challenges, such as gastrointestinal acidity, enzymatic degradation, mucus barriers, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. To address these challenges, this study engineers virus-like nanoparticles encapsulating siCENPN nucleic acid complexes and irradiated tumor cells (ITC), further coated with zwitterionic bacterial cellulose derivatives (PB-BC-BY). This innovative formulation demonstrates enhanced mucus penetration, improves stability in gastrointestinal environments, and effective inhibition of P-gp-mediated efflux. The nanoparticles effectively deliver siRNA into tumor cells, resulting in marked downregulation of CENPN expression and strong autophagy induction. The autophagic tumor cells and ITCs subsequently stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to secrete anti-tumor cytokines, thereby triggering an immune response. In vivo experiments confirm that orally administered nanoparticles successfully traverse the gastrointestinal barrier, enter systemic circulation, target tumors, and significantly inhibit tumor growth. Enhanced activation of dendritic cells, along with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Th1 cells in the tumor microenvironment, further confirms effective immune activation. Moreover, this treatment induces strong immune memory, prolonges survival, and provides substantial protection against tumor recurrence. This study presents a novel oral delivery strategy for nucleic acid therapeutics, offering an effective approach by simultaneously inducing tumor cell autophagy and promoting a robust immune-mediated anti-cancer response.",

In this investigation, we characterized SHR-2005, a second-generation CD40 agonistic mAb, as a potential candidate for cancer immune therapy. Our results showed that SHR-2005 possessed high affinity in binding to both human and rhesus CD40 and could effectively compete with CD40L for CD40 binding. Notably, SHR-2005 was engineered to exert a strong affinity for human FcγRIIb, consistent with its observed Fc receptor-dependent agonistic activity. Treatment with SHR-2005 led to robust activation of the CD40 signaling pathway and subsequent immune response. The murine surrogate SHR-2005-mIgG1 exhibited potent inhibition of tumor growth in the MC38 allograft model and showed enhanced antitumor efficacy in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, intravesical instillation of SHR-2005-mIgG1 also increased the populations of dendritic cells (DC), CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells in bladder tissue. No obvious abnormality except for a reversible local irritation was observed via intravesical instillation. Notably, SHR-2005 induced significantly lower IL-6 secretion than the APX005M analogue in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, the CD40 agonistic antibody SHR-2005 was highly reliant on FcγR for agonistic activation and exhibited promising potential for clinical development as monotherapy or in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of solid tumors. Based on promising efficacy and tolerance in preclinical studies, SHR-2005 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase I clinical trial for the intravesical treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are known to enhance the activity of enzymes, but such findings remain largely empirical, lacking predictive design principles. Here, the first high-throughput platform for the discovery of surface-engineered nanoparticles (SENs) that modulate enzyme function is introduced. Guided by the hypothesis that surface ligands are primary drivers of activity enhancement, a library of 194 gold- and palladium-based SENs functionalized with diverse peptide ligands is synthesized. These SENs are screened against three model enzymes: cytochrome c, lactoperoxidase (LPO), and lipase. Multiple SENs substantially increased enzymatic activity, with the most effective achieving ≈19-fold increase. The resulting dataset enabled the training of a machine learning model that identified key ligand features associated with high-performing SENs, establishing a predictive framework for designing activity-enhancing NPs. Mechanistic studies confirm that the ligand shell plays a dominant role in driving enhancement, suggesting that effective ligands identified via this approach can be readily transferred across NP platforms. To demonstrate functional relevance, it is shown that an optimized SEN/LPO pair outperforms LPO in inhibiting the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria and disrupting biofilm formation. Collectively, this work offers a scalable and generalizable method to map and harness nanoscale structure-function relationships at biointerfaces, with applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and beyond.",

Using the Korean National Health Insurance System database, we identified 40 909 patients with newly diagnosed RA between 2010 and 2017, matched by age and sex at a 1:5 ratio with 204 545 non-RA participants. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) for the association between RA and CRC incidence.

Twenty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were included and randomly divided into three subgroups of the gliomas: C6, 9L, and F98. Sequential GluCEST, 1H-MRS, diffusion weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging scans were performed on the intracranial glioma-bearing rats using a 7.0T animal MRI scanner 10 days after tumor induction. Tumor tissue was analyzed histopathologically after the imaging protocol, with Ki-67 labeling index (LI), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microvessel density (MVD) indicated by Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34), and conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining measured for each glioma model. The diagnostic efficacy of each imaging modality was calculated. Increased tumor GluCEST contrast was found to be associated with more aggressive gliomas. In comparison to various imaging techniques, GluCEST demonstrated the highest diagnostic efficacy. More importantly, GluCEST contrast demonstrated a strong positive correlation with the tumor volume, Ki-67 LI, and MVD. In conclusion, 7T GluCEST imaging enables noninvasive visualization of the glutamate microenvironment of gliomas, thereby offering a reliable and promising imaging approach for differentiating the invasiveness of gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Children and adolescents (C&A) <18 years of age report varying cancer treatment communication preferences. The aim of this qualitative meta-synthesis was to describe C&A voices regarding their preferences for engagement in their treatment communication. This report shares their preferences specific to their involvement in cancer treatment decision-making (TDM). Applying meta-aggregation methods, a systematic search was conducted in multiple databases with no limitation to the date range. Studies included participants <18 years of age with childhood cancer using qualitative or mixed research methods, written in English. Findings were limited to C&A self-reported findings. A total of 3213 articles were identified, with 55 articles included. A total of 156 findings related to preferences for TDM were extracted from 39 studies. Three synthesized findings were identified: (1) How I participate in decisions about my cancer treatment, (2) When I do not participate in decisions about my cancer treatment, and (3) Why I participate in decisions about my cancer treatment. This meta-synthesis identified how, when, and why C&A want to be involved in their cancer TDM. Their voices represent a range of preferences for involvement, from a more passive to more active role. Evidence-based practice recommendations were identified with a focus on meeting the C&A communication preferences.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the majority of lung cancer cases, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations playing a crucial role in disease prognosis and treatment. Around half of Asian patients with NSCLC, particularly non-smoking women, have EGFR mutations. These patients with NSCLC typically exhibit a single EGFR mutation in exon 18, 19, 20, or 21. It is extremely rare for patients with bilateral primary NSCLC to harbor two different EGFR mutations. We report a case of 70-year-old non-smoking Vietnamese female patient diagnosed with synchronous bilateral primary NSCLC, each harboring different EGFR mutations-G719C in exon 18 in the right lung and an exon 19 deletion in the left lung. The patient underwent surgical resection of the left lung lesion, followed by targeted therapy with afatinib for the right lung lesion, which resulted in tumor reduction and disease stability for 1 year before disease progression. Our study underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing synchronous bilateral NSCLC with distinct genetic profiles. This report also highlights the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling to select an optimal treatment strategy to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a safe and widely used technique for diagnosing mediastinal/hilar lesions. Recent studies showed that combining EBUS-TBNA with cryobiopsy (EBUS-transbronchial mediastinal cryobiopsy, EBUS-TMC) or forceps biopsy (EBUS-intranodal forceps biopsy, EBUS-IFB) enhances diagnostic accuracy by obtaining larger tissue samples. However, limited data is comparing the efficacy of EBUS-TMC and EBUS-IFB. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of these biopsy techniques in diagnosing mediastinal and hilar lesions. Patients with mediastinal/hilar lesions who underwent EBUS-TBNA and mediastinal biopsy from November 2022 to March 2024 were enrolled. Following needle aspiration, cryobiopsy and forceps biopsies were performed. The primary endpoint was diagnostic accuracy. A total of 219 mediastinal/hilar lesions were evaluated in 183 patients. EBUS-TMC demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than EBUS-IFB (95.4% vs. 84.9%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis also showed superior yield rates for EBUS-TMC (96.1% vs. 89.6%, p = 0.027 in all malignancies; 96.1% vs. 86.8%, p = 0.042 in malignancies for re-biopsy; 95.2% vs. 76.2%, p = 0.040 in non-lung cancer malignancies; 93.8% vs. 73.8%, p = 0.002 in benign processes). The tissue specimens obtained via EBUS-TMC were significantly larger than those via EBUS-IFB (16.3 mm2 vs. 3.1 mm2, p < 0.001). Adding EBUS-IFB did not improve accuracy when EBUS-TMC was already used with EBUS-TBNA. No severe complications leading to death or disability were observed. EBUS-TMC is an effective diagnostic and auxiliary method for mediastinal/hilar lesions, enhancing yield rates and tissue acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary hepatic malignancy and is globally the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic interventions, HCC prognosis remains poor due to asymptomatic progression, frequent recurrence, and inadequate treatment responsiveness. The development of HCC is closely linked to chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infections, alcoholic liver disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). To better understand hepatocarcinogenesis and support therapeutic development, a range of animal models have been established. Among these animal models, mice are extensively utilized because of their genetic manipulability, physiological resemblance to humans, and relatively short experimental timelines. The most well-established protocol for analyzing the onset and progression of HCC is the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model. Additionally, carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced HCC models, DEN+CCl₄ combination HCC models, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease HCC mouse models (STAM™), alcohol-associated HCC models, hydrodynamics-based transfection (HBT) systems, and orthotopic HCC transplantation approaches also provide distinct advantages for exploring specific elements of HCC pathophysiology. Unfortunately, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of human HCC, no single animal model can accurately recapitulate the disease. Therefore, careful selection or combination of appropriate mouse models for specific research objectives is crucial to enhance the translational value of preclinical studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mouse models currently employed in HCC research, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Such understanding and application of these HCC models are essential for advancing mechanistic insights and fostering the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "High-Z materials enhance radiation dose deposition primarily through strong photoelectric absorption. Leveraging this property, nanoparticles based on high-Z content materials can be utilized as nanoscale radiosensitizers to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. Notably, gold nanoparticles (Au: gold, AuNPs) have been intensively investigated due to their excellent radiosensitizing effect and straightforward synthesis process. However, without additional modifications, they suffer from unfavorable biodistribution and inefficient tumor targeting, which limit their efficacy as radiosensitizers. Herein, we developed ultrasmall AuNPs encapsulated in PEGylated liposome (PEG: polyethylene glycol, Au-Lipo) and optimized their PEGylated lipid composition to improve their performance as radiosensitizers. Au-Lipo formulation was synthesized and optimized to exhibit good stability and cellular uptake in vitro. Au-Lipo demonstrated a dose enhancement factor at 2 Gy (DEF2Gy) of 2.56 which tends to have higher value compared to the commercial AuNPs, AuroVist. Furthermore, Au-Lipo showed substantial tumor uptake in positron emission tomography with significantly improved tumor therapeutic efficacy compared to radiotherapy alone in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (P = 0.035). These results suggest that Au-Lipo is a promising radiosensitizing agent, offering systemic injectability, enhanced tumor-targeting efficiency, and significant therapeutic potential for improving radiotherapy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a distinct molecular subtype of gastric cancer with EBV latency infection. EBV microRNAs, especially rightward transcript (BART) microRNAs, play key roles in the tumor growth of EBVaGC. However, the effects of EBV-miR-BART19-3p in EBVaGC remain largely unknown. EBV-miR-BART19-3p was detected by qRT-PCR in EBER in situ hybridization positive gastric carcinoma tissues. CCK8, Colony formation, EdU and Flow cytometry were conducted in gastric cancer cells with overexpression and knockdown of EBV-miR-BART19-3p compared to the negative control, respectively. Tumor xenografts were conducted in vivo. GADD45B was screened by RNA sequencing and dual-luciferase reporter assays implemented with transfecting EBV-miR-BART19-3p antagomir. Proteins were confirmed by Western blotting. EBV-miR-BART19-3p was highly expressed in EBVaGC and promoted the proliferation of EBV-associated gastric cancer cells in vitro and accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of EBV-miR-BART19-3p induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in AGS EBV cells. Molecularly, EBV-miR-BART19-3p directly targets the 3'-UTR of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducing protein Beta (GADD45B) mRNA and downregulates its protein expression, which consequently reduced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest. Reconstitution of GADD45B can rescue the proliferation phenotype caused by EBV-miR-BART19-3p in EBVaGC cells. Our study indicated Epstein-Barr Virus MicroRNA BART19-3p played an oncogenic role by a novel mechanism of inhibiting GADD45B in EBVaGC, which provides new insights and might be a potential therapeutic strategy for EBVaGC patients.",

This study aimed to compare mpMRI and bpMRI in detecting csPCa across prostate-specific antigen (PSA) strata and identify supplementary tools comparable to dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Images were evaluated using mpMRI-based mp-PI-RADS and bpMRI-based bp-PI-RADS and simplified PI-RADS (S-PI-RADS) schemes. The lesion volume (LV) was manually segmented by a radiologist using ITK-SNAP software on high b-value DWI images. The diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The differences of T2WI-score, DCE assessment and LV between csPCa and non-csPCa in peripheral zone (PZ) with DWI category 3 were compared. For overall PSA, mp-PI-RADS and bp-PI-RADS showed comparable AUCs (0.889 vs. 0.882; P > 0.05). When PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, mp-PI-RADS exhibited the highest specificity (91.0% vs. bp-PI-RADS: 64.4%, S-PI-RADS: 75.0%) and PPV (73.0% vs. bp-PI-RADS: 47.7%, S-PI-RADS: 52.5%). When PSA > 10 ng/ml, S-PI-RADS demonstrated higher sensitivity (91.6% vs. mp-PI-RADS: 83.2%, bp-PI-RADS: 81.2%) and F1-score (0.873 [0.822-0.924] vs. mp-PI-RADS: 0.832 [0.778-0.886], bp-PI-RADS: 0.831 [0.777-0.885]). Among DWI category 3 PZ lesions, neither DCE nor T2WI significantly stratified csPCa risk (P = 0.657 and P = 0.424), whereas LV ≥ 0.5 cm³ showed markedly higher csPCa risk (83.8% vs. 45.8%; P < 0.001). While mpMRI and bpMRI exhibit comparable overall diagnostic performance but context-dependent strengths: mpMRI demonstrates higher specificity for avoiding unnecessary biopsies when PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, whereas bpMRI (particularly S-PI-RADS) maximizes sensitivity for csPCa detection when PSA > 10 ng/ml.

Despite its significant public health impact, molecular epidemiological data on EBV in Saudi Arabia, especially its southwestern region, are scarce. This study aims to characterize EBV epidemiology and clinical correlations using reference laboratory data from Southwestern Saudi Arabia collected between 2020 and 2023, while identifying associated demographic and clinical factors. This retrospective study was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed EBV cases, and Ethical Approval was obtained. Descriptive statistics, χ [2] tests, and multivariate regression were employed to analyze demographic and clinical data from 133 EBV-positive patients. These analyses aimed to identify associations with age, gender, nationality, year of diagnosis, and clinical presentation, considering results statistically significant at p < 0.05. The overall EBV prevalence was 17.5% (133/760). Temporal analysis indicated an increase in cases from 2020 to 2022, followed by a remarkable decrease in 2023 (13.5%, p = 0.01), likely attributable to post-COVID-19 shifts in healthcare practices. Furthermore, seasonal patterns displayed a bimodal distribution, peaking in the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quarters. Saudi nationals comprised n = 103 (77.4%) of positive cases with the highest burden among children, with n = 101 (76%) of cases occurring in children under 12 years (toddlers 1-5 years: n = 57, 42.9%; children 6-12 years: n = 44, 33.1%). Infectious diseases (n = 38, 28.6%) and hematological disorders (n = 27, 20.3%) were the most common clinical associations. A correlation was found between clinical diagnosis and both gender (p = 0.04) and age group (p = 0.001). Finally, age (β = -0.411, p = 0.029) and test date (β = -0.187, p = 0.03) were significant negative predictors of EBV infection. This study establishes the first molecular-based epidemiological analysis of EBV infection in Southwestern Saudi Arabia, revealing distinct demographic and clinical patterns, with predominant pediatric involvement and strong age-related associations. The observed temporal fluctuations, including pandemic-related changes, emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance. These findings indicate the importance of pediatric-focused monitoring, region-specific diagnostic protocols, and further research into ethnic disparities, coinfections, and long-term clinical outcomes. The key limitations of this study include its retrospective design, the absence of systematic evaluation of coinfections (including COVID-19), and the use of data from a single region. To understand the burden of this virus at the national level, further national studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who are resistant to at least both rifampicin and isoniazid, lack effective treatment options in clinic. The gold standard for the diagnosis of MDR-TB is drug sensitivity test, which is time-consuming and has a relatively low positive detection rate. Screening early diagnostic biomarker for MDR-TB is urgent need in clinical practice. A total of 33 patients with MDR-TB, healthy controls and drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) were included in this study. Total plasma exosomal RNA was extracted from the subjects, and the MDR-TB plasma-specific exosomal miRNAs were obtained by Illumina sequencing. There were 644 and 647 differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma exosomes of MDR-TB patients obtained by sequencing and biogenic analysis compared with DS-TB patients and healthy controls, respectively. Differential miRNAs are mainly involved in the biological function of regulation of transcription and protein binding, and enriched in the pathways in cancer and MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, seven plasma exosomal miRNAs in MDR-TB patients were significantly different from those in DS-TB patients and healthy controls. Among them, three of the miRNAs (hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1, hsa-miR-23b-3p_R + 1, and hsa-miR-15a-5p_R-1) were found to be in target relationship with MDR-TB related genes (NTRK2, KIDINS220, NCKAP1, MAPK9, NFAT5, ATF6 and SLC11A2) by target gene prediction analysis. Further the bioinformatic analysis showed that hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1 targets the protein PGLYRP2, a diagnostic biomarker identified in our previous study. We suggest that hsa-miR-122-5p_R-1, hsa-miR-23b-3p_R + 1, and hsa-miR-15a-5p_R-1 are closely related to MDR-TB.",

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic data indicate that aberrant tRNA modifications in malignant diseases can promote tumor growth by facilitating oncogene translation. NSUN2, a 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase of tRNA, is elevated in an array of solid cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, it remains unclear how NSUN2 drives aggressive behavior and if NSUN2 could be an effective therapeutic target for TNBC. Functional experiments, including RNA interference, lentivirus transduction, and in vivo xenograft models, were conducted to evaluate the role of NSUN2 in TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Ribosome sequencing (Ribo-seq), tRNA m5C bisulfite sequencing, and codon usage bias analysis were employed to explore the translational mechanisms underlying NSUN2-mediated tRNA modifications. Glycolysis assays and molecular docking were used to investigate metabolic reprogramming and protein interactions. NSUN2 was significantly upregulated in TNBC and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 mediates m5C modification of tRNAVal-CAC, enhancing the codon-frequency-dependent translation of key glycolysis-related genes, including ALDH3A2, ALDH7A1, HK1, and PFKM. Depletion of NSUN2 disrupted tRNAVal-CAC m5C modification, impairing the translation of these metabolic enzymes and suppressing glycolysis, which ultimately inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, NSUN2 overexpression conferred resistance to docetaxel, while its inhibition sensitized TNBC cells to docetaxel treatment. Clinically, elevated expression levels of NSUN2 and glycolysis-related genes were observed in docetaxel-resistant TNBC tissues, further supporting the role of NSUN2 in chemoresistance. This study identifies NSUN2 as a critical regulator of TNBC progression through tRNAVal-CAC m5C modification and codon-biased translation of glycolysis-related mRNAs. Our findings reveal a novel NSUN2-tRNAVal-CAC axis that orchestrates metabolic reprogramming and translational control in TNBC, offering a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Mouse heterochromatin is characterized by A/T-rich, 234 bp DNA repeat arrays, called major satellite repeats (MSR). We investigated MSR expression in response to a variety of stress conditions by using small molecule compounds. We identified the isoflavone genistein to selectively stimulate MSR transcription, but not that of other DNA repeat elements. Genistein is a natural compound that is frequently used in dietary supplements and has been associated with reducing cancer risk. A 24 h exposure of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to genistein results in a more than 100-fold induction of MSR transcripts. This up-regulation depends on the activity of RNA polymerase II and requires a cycling G1 cell population. Blocking the cell cycle at the G2/M stage significantly attenuates genistein-mediated stimulation of MSR transcription. Mechanistically, DNA topoisomerase poisons phenocopy the genistein-dependent up-regulation of MSR expression. Together, these data suggest that MSR transcriptional response is guided by an altered topology of the underlying A/T-rich MSR DNA repeat arrays and reveal a novel function for genistein that may contribute to the anticancer properties of this natural compound.",

To clarify the electronic, thermochemical, and structural properties of drug (ME) complexes with Mg12O12 nanocages, DFT calculations were combined with the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) study. NBO analysis revealed that the maximum stability energy of the electronic transfer of ME into Mg12O12 nanocavities originated from the LP(1)N27 to LP*(1)Mg5 transition with an E2 value of 17.63 kcal mol. Further, the maximum stability energy value obtained from Mg12O12 nanocages to the drug ME was owing to the electronic shift from LP*(1) Mg 5 to σ*C 31-H 41 orbitals compared to the drug/nanotube complex with E2 = 0.81 kcal.mol-1. Based on the QTAIM results, -G(r)/V(r) value ​​for the interaction between the H41 atom of the ME drug and the O13 atom of the nanocage [(C31-H41 (ME)…O13 (nanocage)] was about 0.37, indicating the covalent nature of the interaction. In the UV-Vis spectrum, the wavelength shift from 198 to 258 nm with the adsorption of the drug on the nanosorbent revealed a bathochromic change (red shift). The values ​​of ∇2ρ and ρ are associated with hydrogen bonds between atoms H41 and O13 (∇2ρ = 0.0602; ρ = 0.0208) as well as atoms O15 and H43 ∇2ρ = 0.0525; ρ = 0.0179). Thus, the interactions mentioned in this series are related to hydrogen bonds.

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and atypical glioblastoma (aGBM) exhibiting homogeneous enhancement and negligible necrosis poses a significant challenge for conventional MRI. The study aims to investigate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and contrast agent (CA) preload dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) to differentiate aGBM and PCNSL. This retrospective study analyzed 27 patients with aGBM (solid enhancement without visible necrosis) and 105 patients with PCNSL, all undergoing preoperative DWI, DCE-MRI, and CA preload DSC-PWI. The relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were obtained from DWI and DSC-PWI. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, Ve, Kep, and iAUC) were acquired using DCE-MRI. The independent-samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were utilized to compare parameters. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the combined effect of various parameters. Before regression analysis, collinearity analysis of parameters was performed. The diagnostic capability of each parameter and their combination were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC) and compared with DeLong test. In comparison to aGBM, the Ktrans, Ve, and iAUC were significantly elevated in PCNSL, whereas the rCBV and rADC were significantly lower (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Meanwhile, these parameters allowed excellent diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.817 [rCBV], 0.751 [rADC], 0.808 [Ktrans], 0.765 [Ve], and 0.801 [iAUC]; DeLong test, p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Notably, the combination of all these parameters significantly increased the probability of distinguishing aGBM from PCNSL (AUC = 0.966). DWI, DCE-MRI, and CA preload DSC-PWI can effectively differentiate aGBM from PCNSL, and the combination of all three techniques significantly enhances the discriminatory efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a frequent issue leading to bowel dysfunction after anterior resection surgery. NICE guidelines state that there is limited research around the management of LARS. Transanal irrigation (TAI) is a suggested treatment by guidelines; however, there is limited research surrounding the effectiveness of this treatment. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TAI in reducing LARS score post anterior resection surgery. Patients who were referred to the pelvic floor nurse specialist team between 2019 and 2023 with bowel dysfunction post anterior resection surgery were evaluated. Bowel dysfunction was assessed using the LARS scoring system during the first assessment and on discharge. These patients were offered TAI and trained to perform TAI. Patients with missing LARS scores and those who were not using TAI were excluded from the study. Of the total 37 patients who were referred and using TAI, 16 were excluded. In total, 21 patients were included (12 male, 9 female). At baseline, 33% of patients were recorded to have minor LARS, and 66% with major LARS. At discharge, there was a significant improvement in LARS score (80% of patients reported no LARS, 10% minor LARS and 10% major LARS). Overall, the LARS score at discharge was significantly lower among patients who underwent irrigation (mean 34.57 vs. 12.48, p = 0.0000000038). Our study shows the importance of TAI in the management of bowel dysfunction post anterior resection for rectal cancer, with more than two-third of patients' symptom improvement.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and management outcomes of perineal salvage procedures (SPs) for IPAA prolapse. Systematic search conducted in PubMed and Scopus with an additional search of relevant cross-referenced literature on experimental and observational human studies involving IPAA for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis from database inception to March 2023. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the NIH quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Meta-analysis was performed by standard methodology using a random-effect model. Main outcome measure was the success rate of perineal SPs for pouch prolapse. Seventy-two publications were screened; 3 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Included studies comprised 27,061 patients who underwent IPAAs over a 37-year study period. Ninety-five patients had IPAA prolapse and pooled prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.3-0.4; I2 = 0%). Patient age ranged from 31.6 to 38 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. Time to prolapse from primary IPAA construction was heterogeneously reported as 2.6 years [<2 years (48%), and ≥3 years (47%)]. Pouch advancement was most frequently reported (88.4%; 95% CI: 77.5-99.3). Overall morbidity and success rates were 23% and 90.5%, respectively. Studies were heterogeneous. Perineal SPs were infrequently performed for the uncommon IPAA complication of prolapse, with good outcomes in mucosal prolapse. There is insufficient evidence on functional status and quality of life following perineal SPs for full-thickness prolapse.",

This study aimed to (1) identify and describe exercise-based oncology rehabilitation programs in Australia, (2) determine whether there have been changes in the number or content of programs since 2015, and (3) describe factors associated with program implementation. A cross-sectional survey collected data from program coordinators of Australian oncology rehabilitation programs. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and using independent t-tests and chi-squared tests. Qualitative data underwent content analysis. The number of oncology rehabilitation programs in Australia increased from 31 programs in 2015 to 76 programs in 2024, equating to an 88% increase from 8 to 15 programs per 100,000 cancer survivors. Sixty-two completed surveys were returned (62/76, 82% response rate). Programs were typically for people with any cancer at any stage of treatment. The proportion of programs offering education decreased by 29% since 2015 [χ2(1) = 6.011, p = 0.014]. On average, programs ran three times per week (standard deviation [SD] 4) for 11 weeks (SD 10). There was increased use of exercise testing in 2024. Program implementation was supported by an increasing presentation of cancer survivors in general rehabilitation programs (30/62, 48%) and challenged by a lack of funding (27/62, 44%). Oncology rehabilitation programs in Australia have more than doubled in the past decade, but availability remains poor.

    "abstract": "Double Homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a potent transcription factor encoded by a retrogene mapped in D4Z4 repeated elements on chromosome 4q35. DUX4 has emerged as pivotal in the pathomechanisms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a relatively common hereditary muscle wasting condition, although classified as a rare disease. DUX4 contributes to zygote genome activation before its expression is repressed in most somatic tissues through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. In FSHD, inappropriate activation of DUX4 expression is driven by a complex interplay of genomic and epigenetic alterations. The ectopic presence of DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells activates genes, viral elements and pathways that are typical of very early embryonic development, disturbing cell function and ultimately contributing to muscle weakness and wasting. This review first traces the history of DUX4, from the FSHD genetic linkage studies in the early 1990s, through to identification and characterization of the DUX4 gene in 1999. We then discuss the seminal studies that showed how and why DUX4 is expressed in FSHD and the effects of this ectopic expression in muscle, notably cellular toxicity. Other pathological roles of DUX4, such as participation in cancer and viral infection, are also highlighted. Maintenance of DUX4 in the genome was explained by discovery of the function of DUX4 in zygotic genome activation to institute the totipotent cells of the embryo. Thus, we encompass the gradual transition of DUX4 over the past 25 years from being considered a pseudogene in \"junk DNA\" to becoming central to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of FSHD and the primary focus for FSHD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a robust and clinically applicable framework for preoperative grading of meningiomas using T1-contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted MRI images. The approach integrates radiomic feature extraction, attention-guided deep learning models, and reproducibility assessment to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, model interpretability, and clinical reliability. We analyzed MRI scans from 2546 patients with histopathologically confirmed meningiomas (1560 low-grade, 986 high-grade). High-quality T1-contrast and T2-weighted images were preprocessed through harmonization, normalization, resizing, and augmentation. Tumor segmentation was performed using ITK-SNAP, and inter-rater reliability of radiomic features was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Radiomic features were extracted via the SERA software, while deep features were derived from pre-trained models (ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B0), with attention mechanisms enhancing focus on tumor-relevant regions. Feature fusion and dimensionality reduction were conducted using PCA and LASSO. Ensemble models employing Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were implemented to optimize classification performance using both radiomic and deep features. Reproducibility analysis showed that 52% of radiomic features demonstrated excellent reliability (ICC > 0.90). Deep features from EfficientNet-B0 outperformed ResNet50, achieving AUCs of 94.12% (T1) and 93.17% (T2). Hybrid models combining radiomic and deep features further improved performance, with XGBoost reaching AUCs of 95.19% (T2) and 96.87% (T1). Ensemble models incorporating both deep architectures achieved the highest classification performance, with AUCs of 96.12% (T2) and 96.80% (T1), demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive and clinically meaningful AI framework that significantly enhances the preoperative grading of meningiomas. The model's high accuracy, interpretability, and reproducibility support its potential to inform surgical planning, reduce reliance on invasive diagnostics, and facilitate more personalized therapeutic decision-making in routine neuro-oncology practice.

    "title": "Senescent fibroblasts secrete CTHRC1 to promote cancer stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Cellular senescence plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Substantial evidence indicates that senescence occurs in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal component within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which profoundly impacts tumor biology. However, despite growing evidence of stromal cell involvement in cancer progression, the specific mechanisms and clinical implications of senescent CAFs (SCAFs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been fully elucidated. The senescence signature was utilized to evaluate the senescence status of cell types within the TME of HCC using the GSE149614 dataset. The CytoTRACE and cell-cell communication analysis were used to find the correlation between cancer stemness and SCAFs. A risk prediction model associated with SCAFs was constructed to investigate potential mechanisms by which SCAFs promote tumor progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing data was used to identify senescent CAF-related genes. Gene expression and clinical data for HCC were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) databases. Using four machine-learning algorithms, crucial genes were identified to develop a CAF-senescence-related risk model, predicting prognosis, cancer stemness, immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and therapeutic responses in HCC patients. Next, we explored the role of Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing-1 (CTHRC1) in cancer stemness using both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Through various functional experiments, we elucidated the downstream signaling pathways of CTHRC1. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were used to verify that key transcription factors bind to the CTHRC1 promoter region. CAFs exhibited high senescence status and a strong correlation with cancer stemness in HCC. A novel CAF-senescence-score (CSscore) prognostic model was established for HCC based on 10 genes: CTHRC1, SERPINE1, RNF11, ENG, MARCKSL1, ASAP1, FHL3, LAMB1, CD151, and OLFML2B. The survival prediction performance was validated on TCGA, ICGC, and NODE cohorts. Immune analysis revealed that the CSscore was positively correlated with immunosuppressive immune cell populations, including M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between the CSscore and anti-tumor immune cells such as CD8 + T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells HCC patients with a low CSscore had a lower tumor mutation burden and showed improved responsiveness to immunotherapy and transarterial chemoembolization. In vitro experiments and bioinformatics analysis further revealed that CTHRC1 was significantly elevated in SCAFs promoted cancer stemness and metastasis via the SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4)-CTHRC1-Notch1 axis in HCC. Our study revealed that SCAFs were strongly correlated with cancer stemness in HCC. A novel machine learning model based on senescent CAF-related genes was constructed to accurately predict prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, CTHRC1 was identified as a novel prognostic and therapeutic biomarker to predict poor prognosis in HCC and promote cancer stemness and metastasis through the Notch signaling pathway, with its expression being transcriptionally regulated by SOX4.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) of the pancreas is a rare tumor of pancreatic mesenchymal origin with malignant potential. Critical to appropriate clinical management is determining whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Because of its rarity, morphologic and histologic characteristics and limited patient follow-up of pancreatic PEComa have precluded precise definition of malignancy. However, because malignant pancreatic PEComa appears to be distinctly uncommon, further improvements characterizing its preoperative imaging features could facilitate use of diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound biopsy and perhaps ablative treatment. This paper presents a case of pancreatic PEComa treated at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and includes a systematic literature review with special emphasis on the key imaging features of pancreatic PEComa. In February 2024, a woman in her 50s was admitted to the hospital with subxiphoid discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper abdomen revealed a round, solid mass in the pancreatic uncinate process. The patient underwent pancreatic mass resection and pancreaticojejunostomy, and the diagnosis of pancreatic PEComa was confirmed through pathological examination. Imaging examinations appear valuable for a tentative diagnosis of pancreatic PEComa. Key imaging features include its frequent occurrence in the pancreatic head, typically small to moderate size, \"pushing\" as opposed to infiltrative growth pattern with well-defined margins, and the presence of a capsule. The lesions are usually solid and often exhibit mild to moderate heterogenous enhancement during the arterial phase, with reduced enhancement in the portal and delayed phases.",

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the urinary exosomal proteome of SCLC patients to identify and validate potential non-invasive biomarkers for improving diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and prognosis prediction. We analyzed 90 urine samples from SCLC patients, divided into training (n = 38) and validation (n = 52) sets, including untreated, partial/complete remission, and relapsed groups. Ten healthy controls were included. Urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The proteomic analysis employed data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Immunohistochemistry was performed on 30 pairs of SCLC and adjacent normal tissues. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct exosomal protein expression patterns across SCLC stages. RAB11A emerged as a key differentially expressed protein. PRM validation confirmed significant changes in RAB11A levels across disease stages. ROC curve analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of RAB11A in distinguishing SCLC patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, P = 0.0004), with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 92%. RAB11A also showed significant potential in monitoring treatment response (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, P = 0.0019) and disease relapse (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.00, P = 0.0005). Immunohistochemistry showed significantly higher RAB11A expression in SCLC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (70% vs. 33% positive expression, P = 0.043). Urinary exosomal RAB11A shows promise as a non-invasive biomarker for SCLC diagnosis, treatment response monitoring, and early detection of relapse, potentially improving clinical management of SCLC patients. The findings provide insights into SCLC pathogenesis and offer a non-invasive approach for patient monitoring, which could improve clinical management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen, or N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP), causes severe liver damage and acute liver failure when overdosed. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can regulate the function of macrophages, which play an important role in drug-induced liver injury. It is unclear whether CpG ODN-treated macrophages play an immune regulation role in APAP-induced liver injury. In the present study, we aim to explore the role of CpG ODN-activated macrophages in APAP-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanism in protecting against the cytotoxicity of APAP. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were treated with APAP (300 mg/Kg) or/and CpG ODN (ODN 1826, 1.65 mg/Kg) by intraperitoneal injection, then survival rate, histopathological evaluation, and inflammatory factors were observed to ascertain the protective effect of CpG ODN. Then, CpG ODN-treated macrophages were reinfused into the animal model to determine the effector cells. In vitro, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics detection were performed to illustrate the underlying mechanism. Last, Acod1 siRNA interference was used to clarify the role of IRG1 in resistance to APAP cytotoxicity by ROS and apoptosis indicator detections. We found that CpG ODN showed a protective effect against APAP cytotoxicity by stimulating macrophages rather than hepatic parenchymal cells. In particular, reinfusion of CpG ODN-treated macrophages to mice can alleviate APAP-induced liver injury. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that the expression of aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1; also known as immune responsive gene 1, IRG1) and the metabolite itaconate generated by IRG1 catalysis increased after CpG ODN stimulation. In addition, we found that the mechanism of this protective effect is ascribed to the increased expression of Acod1 and the antioxidative function of itaconate by the activation of the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway. CpG ODN alleviated liver injury induced by APAP through the activation of the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages, upregulating the expression of IRG1 protein, promoting the production of endogenous metabolite itaconate, and inhibiting macrophage apoptosis which was regulated by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 to inhibit ROS production. This study sheds new light on CpG ODN as a therapeutic strategy in resistance to APAP-induced liver injury.",

Nanotechnology offers transformative solutions, with plant-derived exosomes (EXOs) emerging as promising green nanomaterials for personalized cancer therapy because of their biocompatibility and minimal antigenicity, and eco-friendly production. This review discusses the potential of plant EXOs in cancer treatment, covering isolation methods, advantages over mammalian EXOs (e.g., stability, cost-effectiveness, and evasion of drug resistance mechanisms), and preclinical applications. For instance, ginger EXOs suppress colorectal cancer via cytokine modulation, grapefruit EXOs target brain tumors, and lemon EXOs induce apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer. Plant EXOs also enhance drug delivery when loaded with chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids, or immunomodulators, improving precision and reducing off-target effects. Despite their promise, challenges remain in scalability, purity, long-term safety for non-oral routes, and clinical translation. Future research must optimize isolation techniques, clarify molecular mechanisms, and validate pharmacokinetics to advance clinical adoption. This review offers a complete examination of plant EXOs, including biogenesis, characterization, engineering strategies, anti-cancer mechanisms (e.g., apoptosis induction, immune modulation), and therapeutic applications. It also addresses hurdles like standardization and regulatory gaps while advocating interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge lab-to-clinic gaps. By harnessing plant EXOs' potential, this work highlights a path toward sustainable, targeted cancer therapies, urging further innovation to overcome existing barriers and realize their full clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common and malignant tumor in the field of neurosurgery. Natural chemotherapeutic agents are an appealing option due to their diverse activities and low cost. Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, holds great potential for treating resistant cancers. The specific mechanism by which 4'-hydroxychalcone extracted from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. induces glioma cell death remains unclear. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of 4'-hydroxychalcone's effect on glioma cells. Through CCK-8 assay, cell scratch and invasion assay, q-PCR technology, WB detection and immunofluorescence, the inhibitory effect of 4'-hydroxychalcone on glioma and its mechanism were analyzed. The study found that 20 μM 4'-hydroxychalcone could induce ferroptosis and inhibit the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of glioma cells. Subsequent analysis revealed that this process of ferroptosis was triggered through the xCT/GSH/GPX4 axis, which was regulated by the AKT/mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway. Similar tumor inhibitory effects to the clinical drug temozolomide were also observed in the in vivo tumor model. Long-term animal toxicity experiments showed that high doses of 4'-hydroxychalcone (100 mg/kg) did not cause damage to the organs of the animals. This study provides new insights into tumor ferroptosis research and traditional Chinese medicine-based treatment of GBM.",

This retrospective, multicenter cohort study aimed to assess this relationship and improve clinical decision making. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of propensity score-matched (PSM) data from two Chinese centers and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were categorized into three groups: BCa-UTUC (defined as patients with a BCa history or BCa occurring within 3 months following RNU); UTUC-BCa (defined as patients who had BCa for 3 months or more following RNU); or solely UTUC (defined as patients with no BCa). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare survival differences, and Cox's regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Overall, 7249 cases were included (1010 from China, 6239 from the SEER database). PSM ensured well-balanced baseline characteristics. In the Chinese cohort, BCa-UTUC cases had significantly poorer CSS than solely UTUC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.334, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.547-3.523; p < 0.001). UTUC-BCa also had worse CSS (HR 1.697, 95% CI 1.178-2.446; p = 0.005). BCa-UTUC was associated with worse OS (HR 2.404, 95% CI 1.703-3.393; p < 0.001). SEER findings were consistent, with both BCa-UTUC and UTUC-BCa linked to adverse CSS. BCa history, whether prior, concurrent, or subsequent, negatively affects UTUC prognosis after RNU, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and management for these high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is tightly linked to metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion. However, the transcriptional networks driving these processes remain misunderstood. Here, we identified a novel regulatory axis wherein the transcription factor SOX4 formed a stress-responsive complex with NRF2, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. This process was orchestrated via p62-mediated disruption of the KEAP1-SOX4 complex. The SOX4-NRF2 complex directly activated Phosphoserine Phosphatase (PSPH) transcription-as revealed by luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation-enhancing serine biosynthesis and downstream metabolites critical for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and redox balance. Inhibition of SOX4 or NRF2 impaired PSPH expression, exacerbated oxidative damage-marked by elevated 4-hydroxynonenal-and increased sensitivity to sorafenib treatment in HCC cells. Furthermore, PSPH-driven metabolites, particularly serine, fostered M2-like macrophage polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the promotion of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Analysis of HCC specimens from TCGA and clinical cohorts confirmed that high SOX4/NRF2/PSPH expression was correlated with increasing M2 macrophage infiltration and poor patient prognosis. Our findings revealed a previously unrecognized SOX4-NRF2-PSPH regulatory loop that coupled cancer metabolism with immune modulation.

    "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Hitherto, little has been known regarding the clinical implications of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and its biological mechanisms of antitumor effect on treatment-naïve ESCC. We herein identified the presence of TLS as an independent factor for favorable survival. By characterizing the immune infiltration and genomic profiles based on transcriptomic datasets, we found TLS abundant in enriched B cells with IRF4 as a signature gene. Increased expression of IRF4 and its positive correlation with STING in activating tumor-infiltrating B cells were also investigated using a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. CD40 as a co-regulator of IRF4 and TLS formation, in vitro experiments were conducted to further demonstrate the competitive binding relationships between CD40 and STING with TRAF2 in promoting IRF4 expression and B cell activation via the non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathway, in which CD40 reduced STING ubiquitination while promoting its phosphorylation. Our data provided deeper insights into the potential role of activated B cells and TLS in ESCC, with implications for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Improving CAR-T cell function through a targeted cytokine delivery system utilizing car target-modified extracellular vesicles.",
    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of B-cell malignancies; however, its efficacy can be limited by poor T-cell persistence and insufficient antitumor activity in certain cases. Moreover, interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a prominent agent in cancer immunotherapy, but its clinical application is constrained by severe toxicity associated with systemic exposure. In this study, we developed a novel cytokine delivery platform based on CAR target-modified cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that preferentially bind CAR-T cells to improve CAR-T-cell function. EVs with surface-displayed CD19 and/or IL-12 were successfully generated from HEK-293T cells. Compared with an equivalent concentration of rhIL-12, IL-12 EVs significantly enhanced the effector function of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in vitro, resulting in increased Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and TNF-α secretion, cytolytic activity, and T-cell expansion. Additionally, compared with EVs expressing IL-12 alone, EVs co-expressing IL-12 and CD19 (CD19/IL-12 EVs) exhibited superior binding efficiency to CAR-T cells but not to T cells, as indicated by flow cytometry. In xenograft model mice bearing CD19 + Raji tumors, intratumoral injection of CD19/IL-12 EVs resulted in durable antitumor responses and enhanced the in vivo expansion of CAR-T cells, outperforming CD19 EVs, IL-12 EVs and control EVs, without causing systemic toxicity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of CAR-T cells stimulated with EVs suggested that the increased efficacy was driven by IL-12 signaling. These data demonstrate that CAR-targeted modified EVs may serve as targeted cytokine delivery systems for CAR-T cells, offering a safe and effective strategy to augment CAR-T-cell function.",

    "abstract": "Piper longum demonstrates significant therapeutic potential against gastric cancer (GC), but its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to establish a comprehensive multi-omics framework to elucidate Piper longum's anti-cancer mechanisms. We integrated in vivo experiments, metabolomics, gut microbiota analysis, mass spectrometry, and network pharmacology to investigate Piper longum's effects. In vivo studies assessed its dose-dependent inhibition of GC growth compared to standard chemotherapy (L-OHP + 5-FU). Metabolomics identified altered lipid metabolism pathways, while gut microbiota analysis evaluated its impact on microbial composition. Piperine was identified as the key active compound, and ACOT1 was pinpointed as a critical molecular target through integrated analysis. Piper longum significantly suppressed gastric cancer (GC) growth in a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose treatment demonstrating superior efficacy compared to conventional chemotherapy (L-OHP + 5-FU). Metabolomic analysis revealed that its anti-cancer mechanism primarily involves the reprogramming of lipid metabolism pathways in GC cells, while gut microbiota assessment confirmed that it modulates intestinal flora composition without compromising microbial diversity, supporting its favorable safety profile. Mass spectrometry identified piperine as the key bioactive compound, and integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology further pinpointed ACOT1 as a critical molecular target, which interacts with piperine that confirmed by CETSA. Notably, high ACOT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in GC patients, underscoring its therapeutic relevance. This study elucidates Piper longum's \"component-target-pathway\" mechanism in GC treatment, highlighting piperine-ACOT1-de novo lipogenesis regulatory pathway as a critical axis. Additionally, it establishes a robust multi-omics framework for evaluating traditional medicine efficacy, providing a theoretical foundation for Piper longum's clinical application in GC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Single base substitution (SBS) mutations, particularly C > T and T > C, are increased owing to unrepaired DNA replication errors in mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) cancers. Excess CpG > TpG mutations have been reported in MMRd cancers defective in mismatch detection (dMutSα), but not in mismatch correction (dMutLα). Somatic CpG > TpG mutations conventionally result from unrepaired spontaneous deamination of 5'-methylcytosine throughout the cell cycle, causing T:G mismatches and signature SBS1. It has been proposed that MutSα detects those mismatches, prior to error correction by base excision repair (BER). However, other evidence appears inconsistent with that hypothesis: for example, MutSα is specifically expressed in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, and defects in replicative DNA polymerase proofreading specifically cause excess CpG > TpG mutations in signature SBS10b. We analysed mutation spectra and COSMIC mutation signatures in whole-genome sequencing data from 1803 colorectal cancers (164 dMutLα, 20 dMutSα) and 596 endometrial cancers (103 dMutLα, 9 dMutSα) from the UK 100,000 Genomes Project. We mapped each C > T mutation to its genomic features, including normal DNA methylation state, replication timing, transcription strand, and replication strand, to investigate the mechanism(s) by which these mutations arise. We confirmed that dMutSα tumours specifically had higher CpG > TpG burdens than dMutLα tumours. We could fully reconstitute the observed dMutSα CpG > TpG mutation spectrum by adding CpG > TpG mutations in proportion to their SBS1 activity to the dMutLα spectrum. However, other evidence indicated that the SBS1 excess in dMutSα cancers did not come from 5'-methylcytosine deamination alone: non-CpG C > T mutations were also increased in dMutSα cancers; and, in contrast to tumours deficient in BER, CpG > TpG mutations were biased to the leading DNA replication strand, at similar levels in dMutSα and dMutLα cancers, suggesting an origin in DNA replication. Other substitution mutations usually corrected by BER were not increased in dMutSα tumours. There is a CpG > TpG and SBS1 excess specific to dMutSα MMRd tumours, consistent with previous reports, and we find a general increase in somatic C > T mutations. Contrary to some other studies, the similar leading replication strand bias in both dMutSα and dMutLα tumours indicates that at least some of the excess CpG > TpG mutations arise via DNA replication errors, and not primarily via the replication-independent deamination of 5'-methylcytosine.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) offers a non-invasive, deep-penetrating approach by using ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers and generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Yet poor intratumoral delivery and low ROS quantum yields of existing agents have stalled clinical translation. Here, we present a synergistic SDT platform that overcomes these barriers by combining transient vasodilation of tumor microvessels with the clinically widely used Antianginal drug isosorbide mononitrate and an acceptor-donor-acceptor-donor-acceptor type organic nanosonosensitizer (BTz) engineered for a narrow bandgap and enhanced ultrasound responsiveness. Isosorbide mononitrate increases nanosonosensitizer accumulation by ~ 1.8-fold. Under ultrasound irradiation, nanosonosensitizer produced high ROS generation, resulting in 78% tumor growth inhibition in murine HCC models-nearly double that of SDT alone-without detectable systemic toxicity. Crucially, the near-infrared fluorescence of nanosonosensitizer enabled real-time, image-guided tracking of sonosensitizer uptake and therapeutic response. By repurposing a safe vasodilator and integrating it with a high-performance organic sonosensitizer, this work establishes a readily translatable, minimally invasive paradigm for precise SDT of localized, inoperable or metastatic HCC.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer is characterized by its heterogeneous nature and high propensity for recurrence and progression. The absence of reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to accurately identify high-risk patients further complicates the clinical management of the disease. MOC-31, an antibody that targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), is utilized to distinguish between mesothelioma and metastatic cancer, but its clinical utility, prognostic value and functional dynamics in bladder cancer have yet to be verified. A comprehensive analysis of EpCAM expression and its associations with key clinicopathological parameters was performed via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, we retrospectively assessed EpCAM expression in our bladder cancer cohort using MOC-31 antibody and examined its prognostic value and correlation with clinicopathological features. The cBioPortal, STRING and TIMER databases were used to explore the interactions between EpCAM expression, immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes. The difference in EpCAM expression varied widely across various cancer types and was strongly correlated with advanced cancer stage. EpCAM staining with MOC-31 exhibited membranous positivity in 51.7% of the analysed cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a discernible trend suggesting a poorer prognosis for patients with low EpCAM expression than for those with high EpCAM expression. Protein-protein interaction demonstrated that EFGR, HER2 and Claudin-7 are key EpCAM interactors. A strong association was observed between EpCAM expression and immune cell infiltration as well as immune-related genes. This study highlights the prognostic value of EpCAM in bladder cancer, revealing a strong link between EpCAM expression and disease pathogenesis. These results underscore the need for further research to validate these findings and explore the significance of EpCAM as a therapeutic target in managing bladder cancer.",

This study introduces a novel approach that integrates single-cell sequencing with deep learning (DL), which enables the identification of tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells without neoantigen screening. The T Cell Receptor Engineered T (TCR-T) cell tumor organoid killing model was employed to validate the functionality of DL-identified TR CD8 + T cells, while spatial transcriptomics was used to confirm receptor-ligand interactions involving TR CD8 + TILs. Comprehensive analyses of TR CD8 + TILs revealed impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain-related pathways regulated by the transcription factor FOS. The TIGIT-NECTIN2 axis was identified as an important immune checkpoint molecule in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis demonstrated that some TR CD8 + TILs possess multiple TCR αβ combinations. Furthermore, TCR-T targeting experiments using tumor organoids revealed that combinations of multiple distinct TR TCRs exhibit significantly superior tumor-killing capabilities compared to a single type TCR. Clinically, a higher proportion of TR CD8 + TILs was positively associated with improved responses to neoadjuvant immunotherapy and longer overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients. This study represents a significant advancement in the understanding of TR TIL biology and provides a rapid and accurate method to identify TR CD8 TILs.",

Molecular subtyping using immunohistochemical (IHC) markers offers a cost-effective approach for therapeutic guidance and assessing survival. Moreover, MIBC molecular subclassification provides a practical approach for guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We evaluated 124 MIBC cases using IHC markers GATA3, CK5/6, and p16. Cases were classified as luminal (GATA3+, CK5/6-), basal (GATA3-, CK5/6+), or other (GATA3-, CK5/6-). Luminal cases were further subdivided into luminal unstable (LumU; p16+) and luminal papillary (LumP; p16-). Clinicopathological characteristics of MIBC molecular subtypes were also assessed. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were evaluated relative to clinicopathological features and MIBC subtypes. In our study, 36.2% of the cases were LumU, 27.6% LumP, and 24.8% basal. The basal subtype generally shows a significantly higher tumor stage (p < 0.05). PD-1 was expressed in 70.5% of cases, with the highest expression in LumU (84.21%). PD-1 expression was significantly higher in the luminal compared to the basal subtype (82.1% vs. 53.8%, p < 0.01). PD-L1, expressed in 40% of cases, was significantly elevated in stage III and considerably higher in basal than luminal subtype (57.7% vs. 34.3%, p < 0.05). MIBCs were practically subclassified into LumU, LumP, basal, and other subtypes using three IHC markers. PD-1 expression was higher in the luminal subtype, while PD-L1 was predominantly elevated in the basal subtype. These findings highlight the potential of IHC-based subtyping to guide prognosis and treatment in MIBCs.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is increasingly recognized as a significant public health concern associated with mortality risk. However, whether the impact of social isolation on mortality differs between individuals with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of social isolation with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CVDM), cancer mortality (CAM), other cause mortality (OTM), and premature mortality in MetS and non-MetS populations using data from large cohorts in the UK and the US. This study analyzed data from 75,190 participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 229,388 participants without MetS in the UK Biobank, as well as 5758 MetS participants and 7448 non-MetS participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants included in the study were aged 40 years or above. The identification of MetS was based on a comprehensive assessment of multiple biochemical indicators, including waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels. Social isolation was evaluated using information on marital status, household size, frequency of contact with family and friends, and engagement in social activities. The primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, other-cause mortality, and premature mortality, defined as death before the age of 70. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between social isolation and various mortality outcomes. In addition, interaction and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the potential modifying effects of MetS status, as well as lifestyle and other risk factors, on the relationship between social isolation and mortality. In the UK Biobank, the rates of all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality among participants with MetS were 9.07%, 1.48%, 4.22%, 3.36%, and 1.98%, respectively; the corresponding rates among participants without MetS were 4.81%, 0.51%, 2.61%, 1.68%, and 2.47%. In NHANES, the respective mortality rates among individuals with MetS were 26.20%, 9.24%, 6.15%, 10.85%, and 13.90%, and among those without MetS were 25.80%, 8.13%, 6.31%, 11.30%, and 14.10%. Cox regression analyses showed that, in the fully adjusted models, social isolation was significantly associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality in both individuals with and without MetS. In the UK Biobank, the HRs for participants with MetS were 1.30, 1.21, 1.12, 1.38, and 1.39, respectively; for those without MetS, the HRs were 1.51, 1.75, 1.30, 1.76, and 1.54, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the HRs for the MetS group were 1.14, 1.54, 1.48, 1.71, and 1.09, respectively; while for the non-MetS group, the HRs were 1.60, 1.75, 1.47, 1.56, and 1.39, respectively. The results of the interaction and sensitivity analyses were consistent. Compared to individuals without MetS, those with MetS have higher mortality rates. Moreover, social isolation is associated with increased mortality regardless of MetS status. It is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, CVDM, CAM, OTM, and premature mortality in both MetS and non-MetS populations. Notably, the impact of social isolation on all-cause, cardiovascular, and premature mortality is more pronounced in individuals without MetS. Public health strategies should focus on population-wide interventions to reduce social isolation, enhance social engagement, and improve overall health and longevity, rather than targeting only high-risk groups.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), is rising due to more frequent incidental findings. Despite a high 10-year survival rate of 93%, up to 28% of PTC patients experience locoregional recurrence. Postoperative monitoring typically relies on serum thyroglobulin (Tg), but the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) interferes with Tg measurement, necessitating reliable detection methods. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of postoperative TgAb levels for PTC recurrence and establish a TgAb threshold as a prognostic marker. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 15,620 patients who underwent bilateral total thyroidectomies at Gangnam Severance Hospital between March 2004 and December 2022. After excluding patients with unmeasurable postoperative TgAb or other carcinoma types, the final cohort comprised 4,434 PTC patients (775 men and 3,659 women, median age 46 ± 11.68 years). Bilateral total thyroidectomy was performed on all patients. TgAb levels were measured 2 days post-surgery and annually, with the most recent levels used for analysis. The primary outcome was PTC recurrence, analyzed based on stratified TgAb levels. Elevated TgAb levels were significantly associated with increased tumor size and recurrence rates (P < 0.001). Patients with TgAb levels above 440 IU/mL showed a higher recurrence rate (13.3%) compared to those with lower levels. A TgAb threshold of 440 IU/mL was identified as a novel recurrence marker, with an odds ratio of 6.0 (95% CI: 2.987-12.053, P < 0.0001). The disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with TgAb levels above this threshold. Postoperative TgAb levels are a useful prognostic indicator for PTC recurrence, with a proposed threshold of 440 IU/mL serving as a predictive marker. This threshold provides valuable insight for monitoring patients, irrespective of test timing post-surgery, and may guide clinical decision-making for identifying high-risk patients.",

The CBAMRegGAN model was trained on 114 paired CT and CBCT datasets from 114 nasopharyngeal cancer patients to enhance CBCT images, with CT images as ground truth. The dataset was split into 82 patients for training, 12 for validation, and 20 for testing. The radiomic features in 6 different categories, including first-order, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size-zone matrix(GLSZM), neighbouring gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM), and gray-level dependence matrix (GLDM), were extracted from the gross tumor volume (GTV) of original CBCT, enhanced CBCT, and CT. Comparing feature errors between original and enhanced CBCT showed that deep learning-based enhancement improves radiomic feature accuracy. The CBAMRegGAN model achieved improved image quality with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 29.52 ± 2.28 dB, normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.0129 ± 0.004, and structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.910 ± 0.025 for enhanced CBCT images. This led to reduced errors in most radiomic features, with average reductions across 20 patients of 19.0%, 24.0%, 3.0%, 19%, 15.0%, and 5.0% for first-order, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, and GLDM features.

Overall, 335 patients who received TRT and ICI therapy concurrently or sequentially were included in our study. Pneumonitis was assessed and the related factors were analyzed. After combined TRT and ICI therapy, among the 335 patients, 219 (65.4%) patients had no pneumonitis or Grade 1 pneumonitis, 77 (23.0%) patients had Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 39 (11.6%) patients had Grade 3 or above pneumonitis.

We also found that, numerically, patients who received ICIs before radiotherapy (RT) were more likely to have pneumonitis than those who received RT before ICIs. Moreover, a longer interval between treatments, lower mean lung dose (MLD) and smaller ipsilateral or bilateral lung dose‒volume parameters are correlated with a lower incidence of pneumonitis of Grade 2 or above.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the therapeutic response of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is of significant clinical importance. The use of TKIs in clinical is primarily guided by the detection of EGFR gene mutations. However, the current EGFR mutation assays face challenges such as inconsistent correlation with therapeutic outcomes, inconvenient sample availability and limited sensitivity. To address these, we have designed and synthesized a novel theranostic agent, OSA-Cy7, by conjugating the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib with the near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore Cy7. This conjugate aims to enable fluorescence-based detection of mutant EGFR and targeted therapy of NSCLC. Our studies demonstrated that OSA-Cy7 selectively accumulates in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, such as PC9 (exon 19 deletion) and H1975 (L858R/T790M), exhibiting enhanced fluorescence signals, while showing minimal uptake in wild-type EGFR A549 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that OSA-Cy7 effectively inhibits EGFR phosphorylation in mutant cell lines, with negligible effects on wild-type EGFR phosphorylation. Furthermore, OSA-Cy7 treatment resulted in significant suppression on cell proliferation and colony formation in EGFR-mutant cells, indicating its potent anticancer activity. These findings suggest that OSA-Cy7 holds promise as a theranostic agent for the selective imaging and treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC, potentially improving patient stratification and therapeutic monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Severe hypercalcemia is a rare but serious complication observed in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with multiple bone lesions. Currently, no standard therapy has been established for this life-threatening condition. A 54-year-old Japanese woman with severe hypercalcemia (serum total calcium concentration of 23.0 mg/dL) was referred to our hospital. Initial management included multiple sessions of emergency hemodialysis, aggressive hydration, and administration of calcitonin. Although these interventions temporarily improved her condition, her serum calcium levels soon rebounded. The addition of bisphosphonates did not induce a prompt or sufficient reduction in serum calcium levels. Computed tomography revealed osteolytic lesions, strongly suggestive of malignancy. Given that the pathological condition was attributed to bone lesions, denosumab was administered, leading to a marked reduction in serum calcium levels and sustained control. A definitive diagnosis of DLBCL was established through bone biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. Based on these findings, severe hypercalcemia was determined to be secondary to DLBCL with multiple bone lesions. Following the initiation of chemotherapy, her serum calcium levels remained stable during follow-up. Severe hypercalcemia in this case was caused by DLBCL with multiple bone lesions. Successful management was achieved through a combination of emergency hemodialysis, aggressive hydration, and a multi-drug regimen, including calcitonin, bisphosphonates, and denosumab.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is a significant global health concern, and accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. However, manual diagnosis can be challenging due to the subtle visual differences between benign and malignant lesions. This study introduces Skin-DeepNet, a novel deep learning-based framework designed for the automated early diagnosis and classification of skin cancer lesions from dermoscopy images. Skin-DeepNet incorporates a two-step pre-processing stage to enhance image contrast, followed by robust skin lesion segmentation using Mask R-CNN and GrabCut algorithm to achieve near-perfect segmentation accuracy (IOU up to 99.93%). Then a dual-feature extraction strategy is performed using a combination of a pre-trained high-resolution network (HRNet) model and attention block, which serve as feature descriptors. A deep belief networks (DBN) model is then trained on their outputs to capture high-level discriminative features. Finally, robust decision fusion strategies are employed to integrate the predictions of the proposed models using boosting and stacking to enhance overall Skin-DeepNet's accuracy. The Skin-DeepNet's performance has been validated on two challenging datasets: ISIC 2019 and HAM1000. The Skin-DeepNet system has outperformed the existing state-of-the-art systems by achieving an accuracy rate of 99.65% Precision of 99.51%, AUC of 99.94% on the ISIC 2019 dataset. Similarly, on the HAM1000 dataset, the Skin-DeepNet system demonstrated an accuracy rate, precision, and AUC of 100%, 99.92%, and 99.97%, respectively. These findings indicate that the developed Skin-DeepNet system can exhibit outstanding proficiency in accurately classifying skin lesions while aiding physicians in early diagnosis and treatment tasks in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal neuroendocrine neoplasms (CrNENs) are rare malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The roles of genetic, epigenetic, and immune factors in CrNEN progression remain largely unknown. We employed an integrative multi-omics approach combining two-sample Mendelian randomization, Bayesian colocalization, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), cis-expression QTLs (cis-eQTLs), protein QTLs (pQTLs), summary data-based Mendelian randomization, mediation analyses, immunohistochemistry validation, and pan-cancer validation using TCGA and GTEx data, including DNA methylation profiling using the SMART, UALCAN, UCSC Xena and MethSurv platforms to provide integrative insights into potential epigenetic regulation in oncogenesis. Molecular docking was performed to identify candidate therapeutic compounds that targeted the genes. Our analyses identified TREM1 as a robust therapeutic candidate, with elevated TREM1 expression promoting the progression of CrNEN. Epigenetic analysis revealed that hypomethylation at the cg04451353 locus was associated with increased TREM1 expression, mediating approximately 74% of the CrNEN risk attributable to this epigenetic mechanism. Immune mediation analysis suggested that increased TREM1 expression may influence the infiltration of specific immune subsets (CD14 + CD16- monocytes, CD25 + + CD8br Tregs, CD3 on Tregs, CD3 on CD39 + secreting Tregs, CD3 on CD8br Tregs, and CD28 on CD39 + CD8br Tregs), with each subset contributing approximately 1-4% to the total 16.65% increase in CrNEN risk. Pan-cancer validation underscored the oncogenic potential and prognostic significance of TREM1 across various malignancies, with particular relevance in the colorectal cancer. Molecular docking analysis suggested favorable binding affinities between TREM1 and bioactive natural compounds, such as artemisinin and quercetin, which may support their potential as therapeutic candidates. Multi-omics analysis suggests that TREM1 may play a role in CrNEN pathogenesis, with potential implications as a therapeutic target. Further validation and research are needed to confirm its clinical relevance and therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Therapy resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, with multidrug resistance (MDR) being a well-characterized phenomenon wherein cancer cells develop resistance not only to the administered drug but also to structurally diverse compounds. Metal chelators, including quinolines and thiosemicarbazones, have shown broad antitumor activity and potential in overcoming MDR by modulating metal metabolism. However, predicting whether chelators increase or decrease toxicity in MDR cells remains complex, especially as chelator-metal complexes may become substrates for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, leading to resistance or hypersensitivity. In this study, we developed cell lines with comparable expression levels of the three major MDR ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2). Our findings demonstrated distinct transporter-specific influences on chelator toxicity. Cells expressing ABCC1 displayed significant resistance to thiosemicarbazones (Dp44mT, COTI-2, DpC) in both their metal-free and metal-bound forms. Vesicular transport assays further demonstrated that ABCC1 actively transports the Fe-GSH complex, formed under physiological glutathione levels, indicating its role in regulating the labile iron pool and reducing intracellular iron toxicity. These findings underscore the importance of transporter-chelator interactions in shaping drug resistance and sensitivity and highlight the intricate roles of ABC transporters in modulating chelator activity.",

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab (TACE-Ate-Bev) or atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone (Ate-Bev) as first-line treatment for unresectable HCC. This multicenter cohort study recruited patients with unresectable HCC who received TACE-Ate-Bev or Ate-Bev as first-line treatment between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2023. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was employed to minimize bias. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs) were observed. 311 patients were included in this analysis, with 152 in the TACE-Ate-Bev group and 159 in the Ate-Bev group. The TACE-Ate-Bev group demonstrated significantly improved OS (26.8 [95% CI 23.1-NR] vs. 14.9 [95% CI 11.4-19.9] months, p < 0.0001) and PFS (16.0 [95% CI 12.8-17.8] vs. 6.5 [95% CI 5.4-7.6] months, p < 0.0001) compared to the Ate-Bev group, both in BCLC stage B (mOS: NR vs. 15.6 months, p < 0.0001; mPFS: 16.9 vs. 6.7 months, p < 0.0001) and BCLC stage C (mOS: 25.2 vs. 14.3 months, p = 0.00018; mPFS: 12.8 vs. 6.5 months, p < 0.0001) disease. After IPTW adjustment, the TACE-Ate-Bev group also demonstrated significantly improved OS and PFS compared to the Ate-Bev group, both in BCLC stage B and BCLC stage C disease. Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 36 patients (24.3%) in the TACE-Ate-Bev group and 34 (21.4%) in the Ate-Bev group. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of gastrointestinal bleeding between the TACE-Ate-Bev and Ate-Bev groups (9.9 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.954).

    "abstract": "Understanding locoregional recurrence (LRR) risk is important in breast cancer, as it relates directly to breast cancer-associated mortality. Individualised LRR risk estimation should inform treatment and surveillance strategies. Increased mammographic breast density has been identified as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. However, the precise relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer LRR remains unclear. To perform a systematic review and relative risk meta-analysis to explore the assocation between breast mammographic density and breast cancer LRR. A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Mammographic breast density (MBD) was classified as BI-RADs A-B (breast density < 50%, predominately fatty or scattered areas of fibroglandular density) or BI-RADs C-D breast density > 50%, heterogeneously dense or extremely dense). A meta-anlysis was performed using Meta-Disc and Statsdirect 2.8.0. Seven studies published between 2004 and 2023 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 3008 patients with reported mammographic breast density (MBD) (age range: 20-94 years). Overall, 59.1% (1779/3008) were classified as low MBD (BI-RADS A-B) and 40.9% (1229/3008) were classified as high MBD (BI-RADS C-D). Of these patients, 68.9% (2073/3008) were treated for invasive breast carcinoma and 31.1% had ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was performed in 71.1% (2139/3008) of patients, mastectomy was performed in 28.2% (850/3008),. The median follow-up was 94.1 months, and the overall LRR rate was 12.8% (386/3008). Five of the seven studies reported a correlation between BI-RADs C-D and the development of LRR. LRR rates were lower in patients with low mammographic breast density (9.9% for BI-RADS A-B (177/1779)) compared to those with higher mammogaphic breast density (17.0% for BI-RADs C-D. (209/1229)) [P < 0.001, Chi Square]. BI-RADS C-D density on mammography was associated with an increased risk of locoregional recurrence (pooled relative risk 1.41; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.70). Increased mammographic breast density may be associated with an increased risk of LRR. Multidisciplinary team discussions should consider MBD as a potential prognostic factor in when considering surveillance and locoregional control after breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "In tumorous conditions, STAT1, traditionally recognized for its anti-tumor role in immunology, exhibits pro-survival characteristics, though unclear mechanisms. Investigating STAT1 function in isogenic colorectal tumor cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS, we found that STAT1 specifically promotes tumor survival and proliferation with mutant KRAS. Gene expression profiling revealed that STAT1 promotes the expression of sterol and lipid biosynthesis genes in these cells. This effect depends on STAT1 phosphorylation at S727, which upregulates SREBP1 and SREBP2 to drive de novo lipid production. In mutant KRAS cells, STAT1 amplifies the mevalonate pathway, maintaining its S727 phosphorylation and establishing a positive feedback loop through the transcription factors YAP1 and TEAD4, further driving lipid biosynthesis and tumor growth. This STAT1-YAP1 axis promotes mutant KRAS tumor cells' resistance to mevalonate pathway inhibitors, which can be overcome by pharmacologically targeting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. Moreover, this axis contributes to the inherent resistance of mutant KRAS colon cancer cells to EGFR-targeted therapy. Together, these findings identify the STAT1-YAP1 pathway as a critical mediator of therapy resistance and a promising therapeutic target in mutant KRAS colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors are widely expressed on immune cells, often acting as self-ligands and playing crucial roles in cellular communication and adhesion, thereby modulating immune responses. Several studies have demonstrated that SLAM family receptors are associated with potential immune checkpoints on T cells and play a role in tumor immunity in various cancers. However, the effect of SLAMF1 expression in tumors has been rarely investigated. Here, we confirmed SLAMF1 expression using tissue microarray analysis in breast cancer tissues with diverse pathological characteristics and subtypes. Additionally, SLAMF1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells was analyzed using flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Public clinical data analysis suggests that a positive correlation exists between SLAMF1 expression and overall survival and that SLAMF1 levels are slightly increased in patients with breast cancer who received radiation therapy. Similarly, when TNBC cells were irradiated, SLAMF1 expression specifically increased compared to that in non-irradiated cells. To study the biological function of SLAMF1 in mice, we established 4T1-SLAMF1 overexpressing a stable cell line. In the 4T1 syngenetic tumor model, SLAMF1 overexpression triggered strong infiltrating-CD8+ T cell responses and significantly reduced the tumor growth. Our results provide clear evidence for SLAMF1 expression in breast cancer and provide insights into the recent advances in SLAM-based targeted immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a substantial genetic basis, with APOE4 homozygotes increasingly recognized as a distinct genetic subtype. To identify genotype-specific metabolic pathways and modifiable risk factors, we integrated genetic, plasma metabolomic and dietary data from 4,215 women and 1,490 men in prospective cohorts. Here we show that the associations of 57 metabolites with dementia risk varied by APOE4 genotype or other AD/ADRD risk variants. For example, cholesteryl esters and sphingomyelins were most strongly associated with increased dementia risk in APOE4 homozygotes, whereas inverse associations with glycerides were specific to this genotype. Dimethylguanidino-valeric acid was more strongly associated with dementia risk among carriers of the rs2154481-C allele (APP). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet more effectively modulated dementia-related metabolites in APOE4 homozygotes, suggesting targeted prevention strategies. Incorporating metabolomic data modestly improved dementia risk prediction, particularly during early follow-up. Mendelian randomization analysis identified 19 putative causal relationships between metabolites and cognitive outcomes, including protective effects of 4-guanidinobutanoate, carotenoids and N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine. These findings reveal genotype-dependent metabolic profiles of cognitive health and support precision nutrition approaches for ADRD prevention.",

Immunosenescence has been shown to contribute to the development and progression of various diseases; however, its specific role in solid tumors has not been fully delineated. Here we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial involving 51 patients with cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and applied single-cell RNA as well as TCR and BCR sequencing on tumor and blood samples to elucidate the immune cell perturbations. Our findings associate poor response with reduced levels of CCR7+ CD4+ naive T cells and CD27+ memory B cells, as well as higher expression of immunosenescence-related genes in T and B cell subsets. Using naturally aged mice and Ercc1-deficient mice (premature aging), we found that senolytics enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in multiple solid tumors by mitigating immunosenescence. Notably, we launched a phase 2 clinical trial (COIS-01) investigating the combination of senolytics with anti-PD-1 therapy. The results showed that the combination therapy achieved a 33.3% (95% confidence interval 16.6-54.7%) major pathological response rate with a low incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events (4.2%).

    "abstract": "In a carcinogenicity study with SD rats exposed to pyridachlometyl (dietary dose levels, 0, 200, 2000, 10,000 and 20,000 ppm), an increase in thyroid follicular cell (TFC) adenoma and/or carcinoma was observed in male rats at ≥ 2000 ppm but not in female rats. We evaluated the mode of action (MOA) of pyridachlometyl-induced TFC tumor formation and its relevance to humans. Pyridachlometyl was neither genotoxic, cytotoxic nor immunosuppressive based on a series of toxicity studies. Data from general toxicity studies suggested that the MOA involve altered homeostasis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) induction. Short-term in vivo MOA studies in SD rats showed that pyridachlometyl caused T4-UGT induction in liver, an increase in serum TSH, TFC hypertrophy and/or an increase in TFC replicative DNA synthesis at the early phase of the treatment. In a perchlorate discharge test, pyridachlometyl did not inhibit iodine uptake or iodine organification, indicating that pyridachlometyl does not inhibit sodium iodide symporter nor thyroperoxidase in vivo. Since rats are more sensitive to TFC tumors due to HPT axis perturbations than humans, it is generally accepted that TFC tumors in rats caused by this MOA are not relevant to humans. Overall, these data strongly support that the MOA for pyridachlometyl-induced TFC tumors in male rats is via HPT axis perturbations by UGT induction, indicating that the TFC tumor formation by pyridachlometyl observed in male rats is not relevant to human cancer risk.",

The GTV (gross tumor volume) was defined based on MRI (GTVMRI) and PET images with SUV thresholds of 2.0 (GTVPET2.0) and 2.5 (GTVPET2.5) in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) and malignant glioma (MG). GTVPET2.5 was approximately 50% smaller, while GTVPET2.0 showed closer volumetric agreement, with ∆V% of 23.52 ± 17.44 (HNC) and 28.71 ± 12.57 (MG), and corresponding Dice similarity coefficients of 0.71 ± 0.14 and 0.86 ± 0.17. Dosimetric analysis revealed that GTVPET2.0 achieved higher dose coverage than GTVMRI, with mean doses of 24.07 ± 6.42 Gy-Eq (HNC) and 26.36 ± 9.77 Gy-Eq (MG), and D80 values of 19.01 ± 6.90 Gy-Eq and 21.00 ± 7.51 Gy-Eq, respectively.

These results suggest that GTVPET2.0 provides a balanced and biologically relevant target for BNCT planning. A TBR threshold of ≥ 2.0 is proposed as a practical criterion for patient selection. While this study focuses on geometric and dosimetric endpoints, future work correlating these findings with clinical outcomes is warranted. Overall, this study supports the integration of functional PET imaging with anatomical MRI to improve the precision and efficacy of BNCT treatment planning.",

We linked national health datasets to New Zealand Cancer Registry lung cancer registrations from the period 2012-2019 (n = 18,081) to describe the radiation therapy delivery overall and in terms of treatment intent patterns, for all lung cancer registrations and by tumor type. We use marginal standardization and regression modeling to describe the extent to which these treatment factors vary by patient characteristic and population sub-group, independent of other factors. Around 40% of people with lung cancer had radiation therapy, with similar proportions among those with small cell lung cancer (SCLC, 53%) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 46%). Patterns of radiation therapy among those with SCLC were different from NSCLC and from lung cancer overall, in terms of stage, ethnicity, and deprivation. We observed lower rates of radiation therapy among those with the greatest socioeconomic deprivation among those with SCLC. Across all tumor types, and for lung cancer overall, those with higher comorbidity had lower rates of radiation therapy. We observed variation in the receipt of radiation therapy for people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012-2019 in Aotearoa New Zealand in terms of tumor type, stage, ethnicity, deprivation, and comorbidity but not rurality. Differences for Asian and Pacific people and the lack of variation by rurality are potential topics for further research.",

By inferring ancestral prokaryotic transporter sequences during a change in the ion-coupling mechanism, we found an evolutionary transition from sodium-dependent to independent substrate binding and transport. Structural and functional experiments on ancestral transporters suggest that the transition involved allosteric mutations, rendering sodium binding dispensable without affecting the ion-binding sites. Allosteric tuning of transporters' energy landscapes might be a widespread route of their functional diversification.",

Accordingly, mammalian spermatogonia, including spermatogonial stem cells that constitute the source for male gametes, acquire distinctive chromatin organization with weak insulation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that STAG3, so far known to exclusively form meiotic cohesins, generates a mitotic cohesin for male germline nucleome programming in mice. Owing to its shorter chromatin residence, STAG3-cohesin attenuates topologically associating domains, rewires enhancer-promoter and Polycomb-mediated repressive interactions, and facilitates finer and more strengthened compartments, establishing a distinctive spermatogonial nucleome. Moreover, in the absence of STAG3-cohesin, spermatogonial stem cells show an impaired differentiation priming for spermatogenesis. Mitotic STAG3-cohesin is also expressed in human B cells and their malignant variations, promoting their propagation. Our findings on mitotic STAG3-cohesin elucidate a principle of male germline nucleome programming, demonstrate an unexpected mitotic role for STAG3 and might potentially improve understanding of human malignancies.",

We used LexisNexis® Accruint® to construct pre-baseline residential histories for 47,557 participants. A subset (N = 823) validated their LexisNexis-derived addresses via a supplemental questionnaire. We assessed the proportion of addresses with verified locations and timeframes by sociodemographic and geographic characteristics. Residential histories were reconstructed for 93.5% of participants, adding a median of 25 years of data. The histories accurately captured 95% of address locations and 82% of residence durations, with improved accuracy after 1990. This study leverages LexisNexis to reconstruct detailed residential histories before cohort enrollment for nearly all Sister Study participants, creating a valuable resource for investigating the health effects of past environmental exposures. A subset of participants verified the locations and timeframes of a high proportion of addresses in the LexisNexis-derived histories, reinforcing confidence in their accuracy for the full cohort.",

    "abstract": "Certain messenger RNA antigens in mRNA vaccines elicit an insufficient immune response due to challenges in cell surface translocation (CST) of the antigens. Here we develop a modular vaccine platform (MVP) to enhance the immunogenicity of challenging mRNA antigens by optimizing antigen expression and presentation. MVPs enable the modular assembly of chimeric antigens. Our platform comprises diverse modules capable of generating >2,500 combinations with any antigen and displaying distinct antigen epitopes on the cell surface. We quantify the CST efficacy of various modules using multiple antigens, including the mpox virus (MPXV) proteins A29, M1R and A35R, and compare chimeric antigen surface expression in multiple cell lines. Using MPXV as a model, we identify optimal modules that enhance the CST of multiple MPXV antigens, improving the immune response of lipid nanoparticle mRNAs and protecting against lethal viral challenge. With these effective CST modules, we further demonstrate the generalizability of MVP by optimizing additional mRNA antigens, including the human papillomavirus 16 proteins E6 and E7 and the varicella zoster virus glycoprotein gE. This platform is applicable to any antigen of interest, facilitating the development of mRNA vaccines against challenging targets.",

We recently reported a strategy to potently restimulate CAR-T cells in vivo, enhancing their functionality by administration of a vaccine-like stimulus comprised of surrogate peptide ligands for a CAR linked to a lymph node-targeting amphiphilic PEG-lipid (amph-vax). Here we demonstrate a general strategy to discover and optimize peptide mimotopes enabling amph-vax generation for any CAR. We use yeast surface display to identify peptide binders to FMC63 (the scFv used in clinical CD19 CARs), which are then subsequently affinity matured by directed evolution. CAR-T vaccines using these optimized mimotopes triggered marked expansion and memory development of CD19 CAR-T cells in both syngeneic and humanized mouse models of B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma, and enhanced control of disease progression compared with CD19 CAR-T-only-treated mice. This approach enables amph-vax boosting to be applied to any clinically relevant CAR-T cell product.",

We optimize MARQO to analyse diverse tissue sizes from whole tissue, biopsy, and tissue microarray and staining approaches, such as singleplex immunohistochemistry and 20-colour multiplex immunofluorescence, to determine marker co-expression patterns in multiple human solid cancer types. Lastly, we validate CD8+ T cell enrichment in hepatocellular carcinoma responders to neoadjuvant cemiplimab in a phase 2 clinical trial, further showing the ability of MARQO to identify spatially resolved in situ mechanisms by providing multiplex whole-slide single-cell resolution data.",

    "abstract": "Ephexin1, also known as neuronal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (NGEF), plays a key role in axon guidance and synaptic homeostasis. However, our recent studies have revealed a critical role for Ephexin1 in the pathogenesis of colon and lung cancers. Here we used multidisciplinary approaches to further explore the underlying mechanisms of Ephexin1 in cancer progression. We discovered that Ephexin1 is essential for promoting polysome formation by coordinating the assembly of translation initiation complexes. Our investigations into gene expression affected by Ephexin1 deficiency showed that Ephexin1 specifically promotes the translation of genes containing 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) or 5'-TOP-like motifs, identifying Ephexin1 as a key mediator of mTOR-regulated translation. Importantly, we found that the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in treating lung cancer was significantly enhanced in a mouse xenograft model when Ephexin1 was deficient. This suggests that Ephexin1 could serve as a synthetic lethality target for mTORC1-targeting therapeutics in cancer treatment. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of Ephexin1 in cancer pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for improving current cancer treatment strategies.",

Experimental methods are costly and time-consuming, thus rapid and cost-effective alternative method is much required. The effective identification of anticancer compounds using machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution, reducing both time and cost. In this study, small molecules with known inhibitory activities, both anticancer and non-anticancer were considered to train classification models. Molecular descriptors were calculated, and multistep feature selection was applied to identify significant features. Multiple ML algorithms were employed to build classification models and evaluated their performance using independent test and external datasets. The tree-based ensemble model, particularly Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 90.33%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 97.31%. Consequently, LGBM model was implemented in our proposed method, ACLPred. The ACLPred demonstrated superior prediction accuracy with good generalizability compared to existing methods.

This study evaluated a combination of parametric statistical models and machine learning algorithms to identify the most influential prognostic factors affecting the survival of patients. Two commonly used parametric models, log-gaussian regression and logistic regression, were applied to assess the relationship between survival and a set of clinical variables, including age at diagnosis, tumor grade, primary tumor site, marital status, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, race, and receipt of radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Machine learning methods, such as neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and logistic regression classifiers, were employed to compare the predictive performance. Among these, the neural network model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy. The random forest model achieved the best balance between model fit and complexity, as indicated by its lowest akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion values. Across all models, five variables consistently emerged as significant predictors of survival: age, tumor grade, ajcc stage, marital status, and radiation therapy use.

The role of interleukin-13 (IL-13) and its receptors in angiosarcoma pathogenesis has been largely unknown. We first reanalyzed transcriptomic data from a published angiosarcoma cohort and found IL13RA2 mRNA elevated in angiosarcoma versus normal tissue. In addition, high IL13RA2 expression was significantly associated with increased nonsynonymous mutations. We next detected high IL-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2) expression in angiosarcoma cell lines and patient samples compared to other cell types and benign vascular tumors. Moreover, histological analysis showed the presence of IL-13 in the angiosarcoma microenvironment. Functional studies using angiosarcoma cell lines, MO-LAS-B cells, revealed the promoting effect of IL-13 on cell proliferation. The effect was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of IL13RA2 or neutralizing antibodies against IL-13, suggesting the impact of IL-13/IL-13Rα2 axis in the angiosarcoma proliferation. In addition, IL-13 stimulation increased mRNA levels of IL13RA2 and VEGFA, suggesting an underlying positive feedback mechanism, which was attenuated by a STAT6 inhibitor. These findings highlight the importance of the IL-13/IL-13Rα2 axis in angiosarcoma progression and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for this challenging malignancy.",

Utilizing features extracted from hematoxylin and eosin-stained WSI and clinicopathological characteristics, an image score and a clinicopathological score for each patient were computed via eXtreme Gradient Boosting, combined into a comprehensive risk score. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses revealed a higher image score strongly associated with worse 5-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) (HR = 8.80, P < 0.001), overall survival (OS) (HR = 9.02, P < 0.001), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (HR = 8.39, P = 0.003). The integrated risk score outperformed clinicopathological score in prognostic accuracy, as evidenced by the area under the curve (WCH validation cohort, iDFS: 0.805 vs. 0.756; OS: 0.874 vs. 0.807; LRFS: 0.957 vs. 0.870; TCGA cohort, iDFS: 0.683 vs. 0.598; OS: 0.685 vs. 0.617). Importantly, PMRT significantly improved OS in \"high-risk\" patients identified by the risk score, but not in \"low-risk\" patients in both WCH and TCGA cohorts. These findings suggest that the WSI-based risk score shows promise as a tool for prognostic assessment and guiding PMRT decision-making in TNBC patients.",

Patients diagnosed with UC experience a lower quality of life due to rapid progression of the disease. Early and non-invasive detection is curial for diagnosing UC and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate a DNA methylation assay for the early detection and monitoring for UC, with a focus on its diagnostic and prognostic implications. The DNA methylation assay with real-time methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (RT-MSP) technique measures the methylation level of SOX1-OT and HIST1H4F in urine samples. A cohort comprising 436 patients diagnosed with UC or other urologic disease as well as 79 healthy patients was retrospectively utilized to evaluate this assay. Furthermore, UC patients who underwent surgery are included to assess its ability to detect recurrence. The DNA methylation assay demonstrated significantly increased methylation level in tumor tissues and a high positive rate in urine samples from UC patients. The methylation profile effectively distinguishes UC from other non-UC urologic disease, exhibiting a high sensitivity (85.2%) and specificity (90.0%) for UC diagnosis. Furthermore, the assay showed promising ability in differentiating UC patients based on tumor grade, malignancy potential, and disease stage. Additionally, the DNA methylation assay demonstrated a superior ability to detect UC recurrence with a high area under curve (AUC) of 0.979. This research proposes a novel DNA methylation assay with urine as sample for detection, representing a cost-efficient and non-invasive method for diagnosing and monitoring UC disease.",

Further investigation revealed that FAP+ CAFs specifically overexpress LINC01711, which drives lactate production by promoting FGFR1-mediated phosphorylation of lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA) at the Y10 site and facilitating the formation of active LDHA tetramers. These FAP+ CAFs then export lactate into TME via the MCT4 transporter, thereby establishing a chemical barrier and fostering an immunosuppressive TME.

Key findings were validated using scRNA-seq, bulk datasets, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and spatial imaging. POSTN⁺ fibroblasts and SPP1⁺ macrophages consistently co-infiltrated across 12 independent bulk RNA-seq cohorts, and showed spatial correlation in both Visium and Xenium platforms. Those tumor-promoting cell states were enriched in hypoxic, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and were linked to poor prognosis.

Notably, these protective immune subsets remained detectable despite the immunosuppressive nature of the PDAC TME.

Conventional reactor production methods pose challenges related to cost, waste management, and local availability. In comparison, accelerators produce less waste, have lower maintenance costs, and can be directly integrated into hospital settings. In this study, we evaluate the production of radiotherapeutic   177  Lu using a 10 mA, 18 MeV D +  compact linear accelerator design. The design consists of a single radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and seven drift tube linacs (DTLs) that achieve a beam efficiency of 98.5% over a total length of 12  m  . Deuteron activations on a 99% enriched [   176  Yb]  Yb 2 O 3   target are estimated using experimental and simulated excitation functions. A circular target with a radius of 1 cm and 0.36 mm thickness is selected to optimize the yield of   177  Lu while minimizing the production of undesirable radioisotopes, including   174 g + m   Lu and   177 m   Lu. Model calculations indicate that the accelerator design can produce 11.3 μg of   177  Lu per hour. A 5-day irradiation is expected to yield approximately 1.07 mg of   177  Lu (4.4 TBq), while a 12-day irradiation can produce up to 1.9 mg (7.8 TBq). Following a 2-day processing period, the specific activity of the 5-day irradiated sample is projected to approach 0.6 TBq/mg, with a radiopurity of approximately 99.8%. The minimal burn-up of the  Yb 2 O 3   target suggests it may be recycled and reused over multiple irradiations.

    "title": "Physiological Considerations and Delivery Strategies for Targeting Tumors Through Intraperitoneal Delivery.",
    "abstract": "The peritoneal cavity presents both unique challenges and promising opportunities for targeted therapy in malignancies like ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. Intraperitoneal drug delivery offers significant pharmacokinetic advantages over intravenous administration by achieving high local drug concentrations and tumor-specific delivery potential while minimizing systemic toxicity. Despite these theoretical advantages, the clinical implementation of intraperitoneal therapy is limited by several barriers, including restricted tissue penetration, incomplete peritoneal coverage, rapid drug clearance, catheter-related complications, posttreatment peritoneal adhesions, and ascites-induced permeability dysregulation. This review highlights three advanced strategies developed to overcome these obstacles: (1) particulate-based delivery systems, such as nanoparticles to enhance tumor specificity through passive accumulation, active targeting and on-demand drug release in response to internal or external stimuli; (2) Sustained drug release hydrogels and (3) pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy. Despite promising preclinical and clinical advancements, successful translation requires systematic optimization of multiple parameters, such as ascites dynamics, tumor heterogeneity, and multidrug resistance. The integration of advanced delivery technologies with a comprehensive understanding of peritoneal physiology remains crucial for achieving safe and effective clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor characterized by metabolic plasticity and resistance to therapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying GBM's adaptability to metabolic stress is crucial for developing effective treatments. This study investigates the role of Brain Protein I3 (BRI3) in regulating lipid metabolism and autophagy in GBM, and its potential as a therapeutic target. We performed integrative bioinformatics analysis using TCGA-GBM and CGGA datasets to identify lipophagy-related gene signatures. BRI3's function was examined through in vitro studies using GBM cell lines and patient-derived samples. Lipid metabolism and autophagy were assessed under normal and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions in BRI3-knockdown and control GBM cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a lipophagy-related gene signature associated with poor prognosis in GBM. BRI3 emerged as a key upregulated gene in GBM, correlating with altered lipid homeostasis and enhanced autophagy. In vitro studies demonstrated that BRI3 knockdown led to lipid accumulation, impaired autophagy, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis in GBM cells. Under OGD conditions mimicking the tumor microenvironment, BRI3-depleted cells showed compromised lipid mobilization, autophagy induction, and cell survival compared to controls. Our findings suggest BRI3 as a critical regulator of lipophagy in GBM, enhancing tumor cell resilience to metabolic stress. This study provides insights into GBM's metabolic adaptability and identifies BRI3 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating tumor cell survival in the challenging glioblastoma microenvironment.",

Understanding baseline comorbidity and demographic features is critical to improving trial design. We used electronic patient records to study the association of comorbidity, polypharmacy, and demographic factors on trial recruitment, time on trial, and health service utilisation. A cohort of 1671 patients was considered for allocation to a phase I study, of whom 518 patients were recruited to a phase I study and 1153 patients were not. A multivariable analysis revealed polypharmacy was associated with lower recruitment to phase I trials with an odds ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: [0.92, 0.99], p = 0.01), and a greater number of emergency admissions with a risk ratio of 1.1 (95% CI: [1.03, 1.17], p = 0.01). Interestingly, comorbidity was not associated with lower recruitment but was associated with a lower time on trial with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI: [0.62, 0.90], p ≤ 0.001). Demographic factors, including ethnicity, distance of residence from the hospital, and index of multiple deprivation, did not significantly influence these parameters. Polypharmacy and comorbidity should be considered both in the design of phase I oncology trials and in planning for healthcare utilisation during these trials.",

This study evaluates the novel approach of subtotal gastrectomy with preservation of a small remnant stomach (SRS) combined with uncut Roux-en-Y (URY) reconstruction, focusing on surgical feasibility, complications, and nutritional outcomes. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing LDG (2017-2023) was conducted. To minimize selection bias between the URY (n = 175) and conventional Roux-en-Y (RY) (n = 69) groups, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Subgroup analysis was also conducted on URY patients, comparing those with SRS (n = 33) to those with a conventional remnant stomach (CRS) (n = 142), with PSM applied to this comparison as well. After PSM, the baseline characteristics of the URY and RY groups (n = 49 each) were well-balanced. In the matched cohort, the URY group demonstrated significantly shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, and shorter postoperative hospital stays compared to the RY group. Similarly, after matching, perioperative and nutritional outcomes were comparable between the SRS and CRS subgroups (n = 23 each). After adjusting for baseline confounders using PSM, URY reconstruction is associated with significant surgical advantages over conventional RY. Furthermore, preserving an SRS with URY reconstruction is a safe, feasible, and surgically efficient approach, yielding short-to-intermediate term outcomes comparable to those with a conventional remnant.",

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted precision surgery is becoming increasingly popular. However, the relatively low levels of PSMA-receptor expression and background signal can hinder in vivo lesion detection and margin evaluation. Back-table imaging (ex vivo) potentially provides a means to confirm surgical accuracy. For 99mTc-PSMA-radioguided surgery, an innovative gantry-free hybrid imaging technique has recently been proposed, namely handheld single-photon emission computed tomography (hSPECT) combined with light detection and ranging (LiDAR). This study aimed to assess the feasibility and performance of hSPECT/LiDAR in analyzing tissue specimens excised after robotic 99mTc-PSMA-radioguided surgery. We included samples from 5 prostate cancer patients undergoing primary or salvage robot-assisted resection of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S avid lesions that were identified using a drop-in gamma probe. 12 samples (1 prostatic tissue, 1 local recurrence tissue, 10 lymph nodes) were analyzed ex vivo using a custom-built specimen tray, including an optical reference tracker for scan registration. LiDAR was used to acquire a surface scan of the specimens, and the 3D OBJ image output was fused with the 3D DICOM of a hSPECT obtained using a handheld gamma camera and DeclipseSPECT tracking system. hSPECT/LiDAR imaging provided accurate representation of the 99mTc-PSMA-I&S uptake within the specimens. In 8 samples, it helped to confirm a true positive lesion. In the remaining 4 samples, non-visualization aligned with negative histopathology (true negative). A strong correlation was found between PSMA-hSPECT/LiDAR and PSMA-PET/CT (p < 0.05), but no correlation could be established with PSMA-SPECT/CT (p = 0.515). The count rates fount in the scan correlated to tumor size (p = 0.016) and were not influenced by the overall specimen's size (p = 0.558). We present the technical feasibility of a new 3D hybrid modality (hSPECT/LiDAR) that allows back-table assessment of surgical specimens from the already well validated robotic 99mTc-PSMA-radioguided surgery workflow.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy shows promise in enhancing pathological responses in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC), but its long-term survival benefits remain uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the impact of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) on survival in ESCC patients. From five medical centers, 273 ESCC patients were studied, receiving either neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (nICT) or nCT. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint, with locoregional recurrence-free survival (L-RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (D-MFS) as secondary endpoints. To address confounding biases, propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were utilized. An 18-month landmark analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves assessed survival differences. The pathological response was significantly improved in the nICT group compared to the nCT group. Cox analysis confirmed nICT as an independent factor associated with better prognosis (HR = 3.05, 95% CI 1.81-5.14, p < 0.001). Before matching, the nICT group showed superior RFS (p < 0.001), L-RFS (p = 0.002), and D-MFS (p < 0.001). After PSM, nICT showed its advantage in RFS (p < 0.001) and D-MFS (p = 0.003), with a trend toward improved L-RFS (p = 0.075). Similarly, after IPTW, nICT maintained its survival benefit in RFS (p = 0.001), D-MFS (p = 0.015), with an observed trend toward enhanced L-RFS (p = 0.085). Stratified analyses revealed greater survival benefits of nICT in patients with ypStage III/IV (p < 0.001). The 18-month landmark analysis demonstrated that nICT significantly enhanced RFS (p < 0.001), L-RFS (p = 0.048), and D-MFS (p < 0.001) with the first 18 months after surgery. nICT substantially improves prognostic outcomes in LA-ESCC patients, especially in terms of D-MFS and the period of the first 18-month post-surgery, suggesting nICT could be a more effective treatment strategy. Besides, more prospective investigations are required to substantiate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Incidental gallbladder cancer (iGBC) presents unique management challenges. This retrospective single-center study evaluates perioperative and long-term outcomes following oncologic revisional resection (ORR) via open and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) over a 25-year period. Patients diagnosed T1b-T3 iGBC undergone ORR (anatomical resection of liver segments 4b-5 and regional lymphadenectomy) from January 2000 through December 2024 were included. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared between surgical approaches using multivariable and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. A total of 95 patients were included. While MIS was associated with longer operative times and more frequent use of vascular clamping, it resulted in shorter hospital stays without compromising oncologic outcomes. Five-year cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival rates were 64.3% and 55.8%, respectively, with no significant differences between surgical approaches. Multivariable analysis confirmed that long-term prognosis is predominantly determined by tumor biology, specifically T-stage ≥ 3, positive lymph nodes, perineural/lymphovascular invasion, and residual disease, rather than surgical technique. Findings from this study support the safe integration of minimally invasive approach for iGBC ORR in experienced centers, offering comparable oncologic efficacy, improved recovery profiles and supporting its broader adoption.",

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery for rectal cancer has gained attention for addressing anatomic challenges, though concerns about cost, operative time, and oncologic outcomes persist. Studies on laparoscopic surgery initially showed mixed results regarding long-term oncologic safety, but current data is favorable. Evidence supporting the robotic approach remains limited. This study examined trends in robotic surgery, including facilitation of high-quality oncologic resection, defined by lymph node yield and negative margins, using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data. A multicenter cohort study analyzed 87,611 patients with stage I-III rectal cancer undergoing definitive resection between 2010 and 2021. Outcomes included robotic surgery rates, high-quality oncologic resection (defined using lymph node yield and surgical margins), length of stay, 30-day readmission, and mortality. Outcomes were stratified into tertiles (2010-2013, 2014-2017, 2018-2021) and analyzed via univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions. Robotic surgery use rose from 10.1% (2010-2013) of oncologic resection to 45.7% (2018-2021) (p < 0.001). High-quality oncologic resection improved over time: 65.4% to 75.3% (p < 0.001). Compared to open surgery, robotic surgery had 1.39 times higher odds of achieving high-quality oncologic resection (p < 0.001). Despite both improving over time, robotics had higher odds than laparoscopic surgery of high-quality oncologic resection in each tertile (e.g., 2018-2021 OR 1.64, CI 1.49-1.81 vs. OR 1.44, CI 1.30-1.61; respectively). High-volume centers further increased the likelihood of successful outcomes (OR 1.6, p < 0.001). Robotic and laparoscopic approaches were associated with significantly lower mortality compared to open surgery (OR 0.63, p < 0.001; OR 0.72, p < 0.001, respectively). Robotic surgery has significantly improved in oncologic measures, including rates of quality surgical resection and patients' overall survival, over the past decade, outperforming laparoscopic and open techniques. These findings underscore the growing role of robotic surgery in rectal cancer care and the need for formalized training and credentialing to ensure continued progress and equitable access to this technology.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation (EP) is a rare but life-threatening condition with an incidence of approximately 3.1 per million annually. While iatrogenic injury during endoscopy is the leading cause, other etiologies include spontaneous rupture, trauma, and malignancy. EP can present with nonspecific symptoms, most commonly chest pain or dysphagia, and diagnostic delays are associated with worse outcomes. Multiple non-operative strategies exist, including primary closure, stenting (bypass), combination therapy, and conservative management. However, data guiding the optimal approach remain limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of different non-operative management strategies for EP and identify predictors of successful repair. We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with EP across three Mayo Clinic sites between 2007 and 2023. Patients were categorized into four groups based on treatment modality. Demographics, clinical features, imaging, endoscopic intervention, and outcomes were recorded. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as avoidance of surgical intervention. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of success. A total of 72 patients were included (mean age 63.7 years, 65.3% male). The most common cause was iatrogenic injury (58.3%), and the distal esophagus was the most frequent site (67.6%). Non-operative success was 100% in the primary closure and combination groups, and 42.9% in the conservative group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, non-conservative therapy significantly predicted success (aOR 22.4, 95% CI [1.2-407.4], p = 0.036). Primary closure and combination endoscopic approaches offer superior outcomes in managing EP. Early intervention with appropriate modality selection is critical to avoid surgical escalation and improve prognosis.",

However, comparative data on postoperative pain and functional recovery remain limited. This cohort study evaluates differences in pain intensity and pain-related activity limitations following radical lobectomy for lung cancer. A total of 140 patients undergoing lobectomy (70 RATS, 70 UVATS) were prospectively assessed. Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and functional impact was evaluated with the Daily Activity Pain Interference Questionnaire (DAPIQ) on postoperative days 3 and 14. Demographic factors, including sex and body mass index (BMI), were analyzed as potential modifiers. Patients in the RATS group reported significantly higher VAS scores compared to the UVATS group on postoperative day 3 (5.8 ± 2.0 vs. 3.8 ± 1.6; p < 0.001) and day 14 (2.7 ± 1.1 vs. 2.2 ± 1.1; p = 0.001). Only 17.1% of RATS patients were pain-free by day 14, compared to 34.3% in the UVATS group (p = 0.016). The likelihood of pain-related activity interference was 3.8 times higher in the RATS group. Female sex and lower BMI were associated with worse pain outcomes. VAS scores strongly correlated with DAPIQ results (β = 0.43). This study demonstrates that RATS is associated with significantly greater postoperative pain and functional limitations than UVATS following lobectomy for lung cancer. These findings underscore the importance of tailored pain management strategies in robotic thoracic surgery, particularly for higher-risk subgroups.

    "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to climate factors, air pollution, and green space has been linked to respiratory diseases in infants. However, the role of the combined effects of exposure to these factors on respiratory ailments remains unclear. Here we investigate the association of combined exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), climate factors, and green space during the prenatal period with respiratory diseases in infants. We enrolled 454 participants from the ongoing prospective birth cohort known as the Mothers and Children's Environmental Health study. Data on infant respiratory diseases were collected from parents or guardians. Average exposure values of TRAP, climate factors, and green spaces for the study population were calculated based on geocoded residential addresses. Multiple logistic regression and quantile-based g-calculation models were utilized to examine the association of exposure to environmental factors and green space with respiratory diseases. The combined exposure to climate factors and TRAP during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases in infants. High levels of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and temperature increased the risk of respiratory diseases (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.615, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001, 2.658). Additionally, the risk of respiratory diseases from exposure to air pollution and temperature was associated with lower tertiles of residential green spaces. The AOR was 1.064 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.133) per 1 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1.057 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.116) per 1 ppb increase in NO2, and 1.108 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.176) per 1 ℃ increase in temperature. Incorporating green space into the analysis of joint exposure to climate factors and air pollution reduced the risk of respiratory disease. This study proposes that combined exposures to climate factors, TRAP, and green spaces during pregnancy are associated with infant respiratory diseases. Fewer residential green spaces could enhance the association of climate factors and air pollution with respiratory diseases.",

Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways induced by potassium sorbate were associated with cancer-related chemicals and pathways. Molecular docking results showed that potassium sorbate had high degree of affinity with the hub targets, which, combined with in vitro cell line validation, further supported the mechanism of action of potassium sorbate in the regulation of hepatocyte injury, tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis. This study provides a novel perspective on the toxicity of potassium sorbate, and offers a theoretical basis for its safety assessment and risk management in clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "To comprehensively investigate the long-term risk of all-cause mortality associated with general and central obesity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Overall, 5107 IBD patients [mean age 57.0 (SD: 8.0) years; 51.7% female] were included in the prospective cohort. General obesity was assessed using body mass index (BMI), while central obesity was evaluated using hip circumference, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), conicity index (CI) and A Body Shape Index (ABSI). Primary outcome was all-cause death. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the associations. During a median of 14.6 years' follow-up, 591 all-cause deaths occurred. At baseline, 1681(32.9%), 2229(43.6%), 1161(22.7%) and 36(0.70%) patients were BMI-defined normal, overweight, obesity and underweight. Underweight individuals had a 2.22-fold increased mortality risk than those with normal BMI (HR = 3.22, 95% CI:1.70-6.11), while null associations were observed for overweight or obesity. As for central obesity, individuals with the highest quartiles of WC (HR = 1.34, 1.02-1.76), WHR (HR = 1.56, 1.13-2.15), WWI (HR = 1.64, 1.24-2.16), CI (HR = 1.72, 1.28-2.30) and ABSI (HR = 1.64, 1.23-2.20) had a 34%, 56%, 64%, 72% and 64% greater mortality risk versus the lowest quartiles, with significant dose-response relationships (all P values < 0.05). Central obesity and underweight, rather than general obesity, are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in IBD patients. These findings underscore the importance of adequate nutrition and reduced visceral adiposity for long-term prognosis improvement of IBD patients.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral heterogeneity remains a major barrier to durable cancer therapies, largely driven by the persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we employed an integrated, multi-scale approach to investigate how melanoma CSCs respond to siRNA-mediated silencing of three key regulatory genes: KLF4, SHH, and HIF1α. Using a combination of morphological, molecular, spectroscopic, and elemental analyses, we explored structural and biochemical consequences of gene knockdown. Gene silencing resulted in significant changes in cell shape and size, reduced F-actin organization, and decreased PFN1 expression, indicating a loss of stem-like properties. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed shifts in biomolecular composition, notably a reduction in amide III intensity and an increase in lipid ester content. SEM-EDS point-based elemental analysis revealed SEM-EDS point-based elemental analysis revealed relative differences in carbon and nitrogen levels between selected central and peripheral regions of silenced and control cells, at the micron-scale working depth, reflecting broader elemental distribution trends rather than precise subcellular compartmentalization. XPS analysis further confirmed these differences, providing additional insights into the elemental composition of the cellular surface. The integration of FTIR spectroscopy into this study highlights the potential of infrared spectroscopy as a powerful tool in cancer research. These findings demonstrate that targeting critical regulatory pathways induces cytoskeletal and biochemical remodelling in melanoma CSCs, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on cellular plasticity.",

However, integrated studies addressing their electrical, biological, and mechanical properties remain limited. This work investigates a Cu(II) complex based on a Schiff base ligand derived from 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene. Comprehensive textural analyses using XRD, HRTEM, FESEM, AFM, and N₂ adsorption revealed high surface area, nanoscale morphology, and porosity, which are advantageous for antimicrobial and therapeutic bioelectronic platforms. Mechanical characterization via ultrasonic pulse-echo indicated auxetic behavior, a rare and valuable trait for flexible substrates. The complex also exhibited high ionic conductivity, facilitating charge transport in aqueous environments and contributing to antimicrobial efficacy through ionic disruption of microbial membranes. Thermal analyses showed a phase transition at 44 °C and decomposition onset at 70 °C. A temperature-induced insulator-to-metal transition was observed, suggesting potential for thermally activated sensing, temperature-triggered drug release, and adaptive signal modulation. Biological assays confirmed strong antimicrobial activity, with a 30 mm inhibition zone against Bacillus subtilis (agar well diffusion), and potent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with an IC₅₀ of 18.4 μg/mL (MTT assay). These biological properties enhance the complex's biocompatibility and support its role in long-term bioelectronic device stability, particularly in applications where infection control is essential.",

The ACCQ is a performance-focused measure that captures six different areas of adverse competition-related cognitions- athletic comparison, coach devaluation, devaluation of one's own performance, appreciation by coach and family, inner resistance against competitions, and general exhaustion. Data from 278 athletes (Mage = 27.64, age range = 16-68 years) from different sports were collected and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis, which confirmed the 6-factor solution of the translated ACCQ (CFI = 0.915; RMSEA = 0.056). In addition, the different subscales of the ACCQ showed sufficient internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.60). Furthermore, we examined the relationships with cognitive interference, satisfaction in three different domains (i.e., general in life, sporting development, and athletic performance) and athletes' subjective performance evaluations (i.e., performance and peak performance in the previous season and confidence in achieving their goals in the upcoming season). Results indicated positive correlations with athletes' cognitive interference (i.e., construct validity in terms of a nomological network), low negative relations with athletes' satisfaction in the three different domains and with the three parameters of subjective performance evaluation (i.e., concurrent validity).

Surgical resection provides the best long-term survival, yet poor prognosis requires improved treatments. Galectin-9 (GAL9) has gained attention for its role in tumor biology. This study investigated circulating galectin-9 (cGAL9) levels in ICC patients undergoing resection, along with tumor tissue characteristics. GAL9 expression levels in circulating and tumor cells were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 91 ICC surgical patients. The mRNA expression levels of candidate genes were analyzed in 44 available frozen tissue samples. The optimal cGAL9 cutoff was 12.0 ng/ml using minimum P value approach. Higher cGAL9 levels linked to multiple tumors (P = 0.046), poorer overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Tumor cell GAL9 expression by IHC did not correlate with OS or RFS. cGAL9 levels did not correlate with tumor cell expression in IHC analyses or GAL9 mRNA in resected specimens. However, cGAL9 levels correlated with mRNA levels of glycolysis markers (glucose transporter 1 and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha). Preoperative cGAL9 serves as a novel prognosticator for ICC patients after surgical resection. Its association with glycolysis highlights the potential for therapeutic guidance.",

However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to clarify PIGU's role and mechanisms in ESCC by analyzing its expression across pan-cancer datasets, clinical relevance in TCGA-ESCA samples, and effects on cell behavior (migration, invasion, proliferation) and signaling pathways, validated via immunohistochemistry. To examine cell behavior, we used Transwell, colony-formation, CCK-8, and wound-healing assays to assess migration, invasion, proliferation, and wound healing.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker levels were measured using Western blot analysis, and the cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry in conjunction with western blotting. Furthermore, we used western blotting to examine proteins implicated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.To further confirm PIGU's role in ESCC progression, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was employed. Our findings suggest that PIGU is highly expressed in ESCC and is strongly associated with tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis, and is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients.PIGU knockdown not only arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis, but also significantly reduced migration, invasion, and proliferation in ESCC cells. Additionally, vimentin and N-cadherin were downregulated when PIGU expression was silenced, although E-cadherin expression was simultaneously increased.Moreover, PIGU knockdown decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In vivo, PIGU knockdown inhibited ESCC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. These findings imply that targeting PIGU may represent a promising therapeutic approach, and that PIGU could potentially serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).",

Due to its large substrate profile, ADAM17 is known to regulate diverse pathways of inflammation and adaptive immunity. However, the role of ADAM17 in modulating the pathogenesis of type 2 allergic asthma is largely unknown. To determine the in vivo contribution of ADAM17 in house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation and adaptive immune response, we assessed the deletion of ADAM17 in mice conventional dendritic cells (ΔDC) and employed a complementary chemical biology approach using small-molecule novel ADAM17 inhibitor (2155-17). DC-specific ADAM17 ablation (ΔDC) suppressed type 2/ eosinophilic polarized HDM allergic responses and is protected from developing AHR. DC isolated from ΔDC mice showed a reduced state of metabolic activity, immune priming function and suppressed allergen-specific type 2 cell polarizations. Intranasal administration of 2155-17 protected WT mice against type2/ eosinophilic polarized HDM allergic responses. These concurrent results from two independent approaches identify a novel role for ADAM17 as an upstream site in airway inflammation. Furthermore, targeting ADAM17 with a selective small-molecule inhibitor might be harnessed as a potential drug target for type 2-high allergic asthma.",

However, due to poor pharmacokinetics and off-target effects, it has not advanced to clinical use. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, including proteomics, transcriptomics, and ubiquitinomics, to investigate the mechanism of PF-3758309 in HCT116 cells. Our results revealed that PF-3758309 promotes the degradation of RNA polymerase II subunit proteins (POLR2A/B/E) via the cullin-RING ligase pathway. This process is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2), and is independent of PAK4. Furthermore, the small-molecule inhibitor MLN4924, which blocks NEDD8-activating enzyme, reversed the degradation of POLR2A/B/E, supporting the role of ubiquitin-proteasome pathways in this process. Functional assays confirmed that PF-3758309 inhibits tumor cell growth and migration by promoting ubiquitination-dependent degradation of POLR2A/B/E. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of PF-3758309's anti-tumor activity and provide a basis for further investigation into its therapeutic potential.",

Previous studies suggest that MiDAS might proceed via break-induced DNA replication, a sub-pathway of homologous recombination repair activated at broken or collapsed replication forks. We set out to define whether DNA double strand break end-resection factors play a role in MiDAS. Here, we show that several core end-resection factors, including MRE11, CtIP and BRCA1 are essential for MiDAS. In addition, while loss of WRN or DNA2 impairs MiDAS, there is no requirement for other known end-resection factors such as EXO1 and BLM. Moreover, both the exonuclease and the helicase activities of WRN contribute to MiDAS. Because oncogene-induced replication stress is common in cancers, targeting of WRN or other factors required for MiDAS could facilitate the development of targeted cancer therapies.",

Our model integrates chromatin-lamina interactions with histone modifications, revealing a bimodal distribution of chromatin-lamina affinity shaped by nuclear heterogeneities such as nuclear pores. We predict that contractility-driven translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) enhances chromatin-lamina affinity, leading to LAD thickening on soft substrates-a prediction validated through imaging and functional perturbations.

This approach preserves ligand orientation and functionality, ensuring that binding sites remain exposed even in the presence of a protein corona. As a proof of concept, a weakly basic derivative of DXd (DXdd) is remotely loaded into liposomes, followed by trastuzumab adsorption, achieving 95% encapsulation efficiency for DXdd in 100 nm liposomes (with each trastuzumab molecule delivering approximately 580 DXdd molecules). These trastuzumab-functionalized immunoliposomes exhibit improved tumor inhibition in an SKOV3 tumor model, demonstrating the potential of GA-lipo as a simple and effective approach for constructing targeted nanomedicine delivery systems.

However, a single CM mostly has a weak immune-boosting effect.

Inheriting the advantages of parental components, the EV-CM combines tumor antigens with natural adjuvants that can be used for immunotherapy and can be easily synergistic with complementary therapies. In vivo vaccine tests have shown that EV-CM can activate immune antitumor responses and prevent tumorigenesis. To further enhance the immunotherapeutic and antimetastatic effects of EV-CM, Pt-porphyrin coordination polymer as an immunopotentiator (CPIP) was implanted into an EV-CM nanoplatform (CPIP@EV-CM), which combines localized sonodynamic/chemodynamic therapy-induced immunogenic cell death with heterogenic fusion membrane-mediated antigen-presenting functions. In vitro performance tests, cell experiments, and in vivo animal models have confirmed that the CPIP@EV-CM combined with US has better ROS production, tumor cell killing, and antimetastasis abilities.

    "abstract": "Neuroblastomas encompass malignant cells with varying degrees of differentiation, ranging from adrenergic (adr) cells resembling the sympathoadrenal lineage to undifferentiated, stem-cell-like mesenchymal (mes) cancer cells. Relapsed neuroblastomas, which often have mesenchymal features, have a poor prognosis and respond less to anticancer therapies, necessitating the development of novel treatment strategies. To identify novel treatment options, we analyzed the sensitivity of 91 pediatric cell models, including patient-derived tumoroid cultures, to a drug library of 76 anti-cancer drugs at clinically relevant concentrations. This included 24 three-dimensionally cultured neuroblastoma cell lines representing the range of mesenchymal to adrenergic subtypes. High-throughput ATP-based luminescence measurements were compared to high-content confocal imaging. With machine learning-supported imaging analysis, we focused on changes in the lysosomal compartment as a marker for therapy-induced senescence and assessed the basal lysosomal levels in a subset of untreated mesenchymal versus adrenergic cells. We correlated these findings with pathway activity signatures based on bulk RNA and scRNAseq. Comprehensive image-based synergy screens with spheroid cultures validated the combined effects of selected drugs on proliferation and cytotoxicity. Mesenchymal models presented high basal lysosomal levels correlating with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and sphingolipid metabolism pathways. Chemotherapy treatment further increased lysosome numbers, indicative of therapy-induced senescence. Furthermore, the mesenchymal subtypes correlated with MAPK activity and sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Lysosomal and SASP signaling is druggable by inhibitors of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (SLMi) or senolytics, including BCL2-family inhibitors. Especially the sequential combination of MEK inhibitors (MEKi) with BCL2-family inhibitors was the most effective on relapsed neuroblastoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis of 223 patient samples, drug sensitivity profiling of five patient-derived fresh tissue cultures, and in vivo zebrafish embryo neuroblastoma xenograft models confirmed these findings. Inhibition of MAPK signaling in combination with BCL2-family inhibitors is a novel treatment option for patients suffering from relapsed neuroblastomas.",

Excessive intake of sugar has been proven to be associated with tumors and inflammatory diseases. Fructose directly mediates innate immune responses; however, whether it can directly regulate T-cell immunity remains unknown. We show that high fructose consumption accelerates the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by promoting the generation of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells. It was demonstrated that fructose promotes the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells directly by enhancing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation through the glutamine metabolism-dependent pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is also involved in fructose-induced Th17 cell generation. Moreover, metformin can reverse Th1 and Th17 cell generation induced by fructose by suppressing mTORC1 activation and reducing ROS-mediated TGF-β activation. Finally, we identified metformin as an in vivo therapeutic drug for relieving high fructose consumption-induced T-cell inflammation and colitis aggravation. Our study revealed a previously unknown adverse effect of high fructose consumption in disrupting immune homeostasis and exacerbating IBD by directly promoting T-cell immunity, and showed metformin is a potential therapeutic for reversing the T cell immune imbalance caused by long-term high fructose consumption.",

This study was a component of the KOPAL trial and aims to explore general practitioners' (GP) experiences with treating CNMD patients before and with case conferences and with the following consequences for treatment and interprofessional collaboration with SPHC teams. Qualitative evaluation of the KOPAL trial focussing on GPs' perspective. Open guided interviews using narrative techniques analysed with grounded theory. The KOPAL trial was conducted in Lower Saxony and the metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany. 24 GPs who participated in the intervention group of the trial were interviewed. Findings show that GPs have practice-specific routines when caring for people with CNMD. Interprofessional case conferences may lead to more awareness regarding gaps in primary palliative care, one's own care routines or a lack of psychosocial support. Although gaining new insights, GPs follow three different strategies following the case conferences: (1) Maintain routines of care and disregard added value, (2) extend routines of care according to SPHC advice and (3) integration and partial change of care routines caused by SPHC support. These strategies are influenced by GPs' perception of SPHC teams (eg, ambivalence towards SPHC). Interprofessional case conferences to timely discuss care options could improve healthcare for patients with advanced CNMD by revealing gaps in care. Promoting a regular process of exchange between GPs and SPHC teams (such as through round tables) may improve a trusting cooperation. DRKSS00017795.",

Although ubiquitination dysregulation is linked to tumor progression, a comprehensive, multicancer framework integrating prognostic, molecular, and microenvironmental landscapes is lacking. This study integrated data of 4,709 patients from 26 cohorts across five solid tumor types (lung cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, urothelial cancer, and melanoma) and mapped the molecular profiles to the interaction network. Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier survival method were employed for prognostic analysis. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed to identify the key downstream pathways and genes. Findings were validated using independent patient cohorts, cell line models, and in vivo experiments. Key nodes and prognostic pathways within the ubiquitination-modification network were identified. A conserved ubiquitination-related prognostic signature (URPS) effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes across all analyzed cancers. URPS may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response, with the potential to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy in clinical settings. A comprehensive analysis of URPS-associated proteins revealed novel cancer-related interaction partners as potential drug targets. At the single-cell resolution, URPS enabled more precise classification of distinct cell types and was associated with macrophage infiltration within the tumor microenvironment.

    "title": "Where does ISAC (immune-stimulating antibody conjugates) go from here?",
    "abstract": "Immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics, employing design principles similar to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) but replacing cytotoxic payloads with immune-stimulatory agents. These agents enhance immune system activation, enabling more effective tumor targeting and elimination. However, recent clinical setbacks since 2021 have raised concerns about ISACs' viability as ADC successors. Although ISAC development remains early-stage, clinical trials have revealed significant challenges, including limited efficacy, systemic toxicity (eg, cytokine release syndrome), and anti-drug antibody generation. Current strategies to overcome these hurdles focus on optimizing payload selection (eg, toll-like receptor 7(TLR7) vs stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists), improving linker stability, and exploring localized delivery methods. While ISACs face substantial translational barriers, their potential to synergize with existing immunotherapies and treat \"cold\" tumors maintains therapeutic promise. Further refinement of design parameters may ultimately position ISACs as a transformative oncology modality.",

    "abstract": "SU2C-SARC032 establishes addition of perioperative pembrolizumab as a new treatment option for high-risk localized extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS). For patients with stage III undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma, addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab to preoperative radiation therapy (RT) and surgery improved 2-year disease-free survival by 15% compared with RT and surgery alone. This commentary highlights key insights from the trial: (1) the cooperative activity between pembrolizumab and RT, (2) the need for biomarker-driven patient selection, and (3) the potential for circulating tumor DNA to guide adjuvant treatment decisions. Recognizing the heterogeneity of STS, we emphasize the importance of future trials incorporating comprehensive correlative analyses to identify predictors of response and to optimize treatment strategies. Furthermore, we highlight the need for equitable access to advanced diagnostics and personalized treatment approaches so that the benefits of SU2C-SARC032 can be realized for patients with STS throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "Immuno-oncology has revolutionized cancer treatment by mobilizing the immune system to eliminate tumors. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors and T cell therapies have mediated durable responses in hematologic malignancies and select solid tumors, most patients still relapse or fail to respond. To overcome these limitations, novel, next-generation immune constructs, including bispecific-cell therapy combinations, armored cells, tethered cytokines, immune-stimulatory antibody conjugates, and in vivo gene editing, are being developed to enhance specificity, persistence, and immune activation. This Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer roadmap highlights emerging technologies that integrate, redirect, or potentiate immune response. We examine advances in construct design, strategies for clinical translation, and opportunities for combinatorial approaches. By addressing translational barriers and real-world challenges, we outline how innovative engineering can unlock a new era of safe, durable, and accessible immunotherapies. Realizing this potential will require coordinated efforts from researchers, clinicians, industry leaders, and policymakers to deliver curative outcomes to patients worldwide.",

We estimated local genetic correlation (rg) for each disease pair using local analysis of (co)variant association (Bonferroni-corrected p value<0.05) and identified genetic variants jointly associated with both diseases using pleiotropy-informed false discovery rate (conjunctional false discovery rate <0.05). Functional mapping and annotation analyses were also performed. We identified significant rg (ranging from -0.50 to 0.84) across 16 loci, with half located in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region, for the disease pairs of IIM and B cell lymphoma subtypes. Furthermore, jointly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms were predominantly found in the HLA region. Specifically, all disease pairs showed shared genetic susceptibility in the HLA class I regions, while additional correlations in class III and class II regions were specific to DM and PM disease pairs, respectively. For some non-HLA loci with significant rg, functional analyses revealed immune-related responses potentially overlapping between DM and FL, DM and CLL, and PM and CLL. We revealed that DM and PM share genetic susceptibility with common B cell lymphoma subtypes in both immune-related loci and loci with unclear biological functions. These novel findings improve our understanding of the pathological link between IIM and B cell lymphomas.",

The progression of cystic lung disease with ageing in BHD has not been well characterised. To assess the severity of lung involvement in patients with BHD aged 50 years or older. A retrospective computer-assisted search was performed to identify patients with BHD seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China from January 2000 to May 2023. Demographic, clinical, pulmonary function and radiological parameters were extracted and analysed. Among 82 patients with BHD aged 50 years or older, 49 (59%) were female and the median age was 57 years (range, 50-79) at baseline. Pneumothorax occurred in 46 patients (56%). Lung cysts were observed on CT in 77 patients (94%) and were bilateral in nearly all cases. The number of cysts was≥10 for most patients (84%) and the median size of the largest cyst was 31 mm (range, 4-160 mm). Median (range) % predicted values of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were 98 (62-147), 92 (56-145) and 85 (61-133), respectively, for those with data available. During follow-up (median, 41 months; range, 3-259), 35% of patients manifested worsening in pulmonary function or cystic lung disease.

An experienced pathologist visually evaluated the p53 slides, classifying cases as likely wild-type or mutated TP53 genotype. We correlated the results of the algorithms and visual inspection with the actual TP53 genotype. For cases with p53 overexpression (likely missense mutations), the algorithms achieved 86.7% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity (visual inspection: 80% and 95.2%). For cases with reduced p53 expression (likely 'other' mutations), the algorithms showed 92.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity (visual inspection: 40% and 95.8%).

Methods: A total of 36 171 women undergoing breast cancer ultrasound screening in Futian District, Shenzhen, between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024 were prospectively recruited and assigned to either the AI-ABUS or HHUS group based on the screening modality used. In the AI-ABUS group, image acquisition was performed on-site by technicians, and two ultrasound physicians conducted remote diagnoses with AI assistance, supported by a follow-up management system. In the HHUS group, one ultrasound physician conducted both image acquisition and diagnosis on-site, and follow-up was led by clinical physicians. Based on the reported malignancy rates of different BI-RADS categories, the number of undiagnosed breast cancer cases in individuals without pathology was estimated, and adjusted detection rates were calculated. Primary outcomes included screening positive rate, biopsy rate, cancer detection rate, loss-to-follow-up rate, specificity, and sensitivity. Results: The median age [interquartile range, M (Q1, Q3)] of the 36 171 women was 43.8 (36.6, 50.8) years. A total of 14 766 women (40.82%) were screened with AI-ABUS and 21 405 (59.18%) with HHUS. Baseline characteristics showed no significant differences between the groups (all P>0.05). The AI-ABUS group had a lower screening positive rate [0.59% (87/14 766) vs 1.94% (416/21 405)], but higher biopsy rate [47.13% (41/87) vs 16.10% (67/416)], higher cancer detection rate [1.69‰ (25/14 766) vs 0.47‰ (10/21 428)], and lower loss-to-follow-up rate (6.90% vs 71.39%) compared to the HHUS group (all P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of breast cancer pathological stages among those who underwent biopsy between the two groups (P>0.05). The specificity of AI-ABUS was higher than that of HHUS [89.77% (13, 231/14 739) vs 74.12% (15, 858/21 394), P<0.05], while sensitivity did not differ significantly [92.59% (25/27) vs 90.91% (10/11), P>0.05]. After estimating undiagnosed cancer cases among participants without pathology, the adjusted detection rate was 2.30‰ (34/14 766) in the AI-ABUS group and ranged from 1.17‰ to 2.75‰ [(25-59)/21 428] in the HHUS group. In the minimum estimation scenario, the detection rate in the AI-ABUS group was significantly higher (P<0.05); in the maximum estimation scenario, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Conclusions: The AI-ABUS model, combined with an intelligent follow-up management system, enables a higher breast cancer detection rate with a lower screening positive rate, improved specificity, and reduced loss to follow-up. This suggests AI-ABUS is a promising alternative model for breast cancer screening. 目的： 比较人工智能辅助自动乳腺超声（AI-ABUS）与传统手持超声（HHUS）在乳腺癌筛查中的效能。 方法： 前瞻性招募2023年7月1日至2024年6月30日在深圳市福田区行乳腺癌超声筛查的女性36 171名，据筛查技术分成AI-ABUS组及HHUS组，AI-ABUS组由技师在筛查现场采集图像，2名超声医师在AI辅助下进行诊断，采用智能化随访管理信息系统为基础的创新随访管理模式；HHUS组由1名超声医师在筛查现场完成图像采集和诊断，由临床医师主导随访。依据乳腺影像报告与数据系统（BI-RADS）不同分类的恶性率，估算AI-ABUS组及HHUS组无病理结果人群的乳腺癌病例数，并计算矫正后的乳腺癌检出率。主要结局指标为乳腺癌筛查阳性率、活检率、检出率、失访率、特异度及灵敏度。 结果： 36 171名女性的年龄［M（Q1，Q3）］为43.8（36.6，50.8）岁，AI-ABUS组14 766名（40.82%），HHUS组21 405名（59.18%），两组间基线特征的差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。AI-ABUS组筛查阳性率低于HHUS组［0.59%（87/14 766）比1.94%（416/21 405）］，活检率［47.13%（41/87）比16.10%（67/416）］、检出率［1.69‰（25/14 766）比0.47‰（10/21 428）］均高于HHUS组，失访率低于HHUS组［6.90%（6/87）比71.39%（297/416）］（均P<0.05）。AI-ABUS组与HHUS组行病理检查者病理分期分布差异无统计学意义（P>0.05）。AI-ABUS组筛查特异度高于HHUS组［89.77%（13 231/14 739）比74.12%（15 858/21 394），P<0.05］，两组间灵敏度差异无统计学意义［92.59%（25/27）比90.91%（10/11），P>0.05）］。经对无病理结果人群乳腺癌病例数估算，AI-ABUS组检出率为2.30‰（34/14 766），HHUS组检出率为1.17‰~2.75‰［（25~59）/21 428］。最低估计情境下，AI-ABUS组检出率高于HHUS组（P<0.05）；最高估计情境下，两组检出率差异无统计学意义（P>0.05）。 结论： AI-ABUS结合智能化随访管理模式可在更低的筛查阳性率下实现更高的检出率，提高筛查特异度，减少失访率，为乳腺癌筛查提供了新的模式选择。.",

Methods: (1) Using ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line A2780 as parental cells, the niraparib-resistant cell line A2780-NiraR was established by the method of concentration gradient increased induction, and its morphological characteristics were observed using inverted phase-contrast microscope. The half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of niraparib was determined by cytotoxicity assay. (2) Cell proliferation was determined by cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and direct cell counting assay, cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. (3) The differential metabolites between A2780 and A2780-NiraR cells were detected by non-target metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on the above differential metabolites to explore related metabolic pathways. Results: (1) Compared with the parental A2780 cells, A2780-NiraR cells exhibited predominantly short-spindle or oval morphology with reduced cellular projections and indistinct cell borders. The IC50 values of niraparib were 3.17 and 26.19 μmol/L against A2780 cells and A2780-NiraR cells, respectively (F=98.50, P<0.001). (2) A2780-NiraR cells had a slower proliferation rate compared with A2780 cells (F=146.80, P<0.001). The doubling time of A2780-NiraR cells [(37.5±1.9) hours] was significantly longer than that of A2780 cells [(14.5±1.0) hours; t=10.50, P<0.001]. Compared with the parental A2780 cells, A2780-NiraR cells had a significantly lower S phase fraction [(44.5±0.7)% in A2780 cells, (30.2±2.9)% in A2780-NiraR cells; t=4.78, P<0.001] and higher G0/G1 phase fraction [(35.4±1.2)% in A2780 cells, (52.2±3.1)% in A2780-NiraR cells; t=5.10, P<0.001]. (3) The metabolites of A2780 and A2780-NiraR cells were analyzed by non-target metabolomics. Forty-four differential metabolites between A2780 and A2780-NiraR cells were screened using the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model, the majority of which were significantly increased, such as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, L-lysine and 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the arginine metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism were the most significantly enriched pathways. Conclusion: A2780-NiraR cells have acquired a stable niraparib resistance phenotype, and metabolic pathways including arginine metabolism may serve as potential therapeutic targets for enhancing niraparib efficacy in ovarian cancer. 目的： 构建卵巢上皮性癌（卵巢癌）尼拉帕利耐药细胞株，初步探讨其生物学特性和代谢特征。 方法： （1）以卵巢癌细胞株A2780为亲本细胞，使用体外阶段式浓度梯度递增诱导法建立尼拉帕利耐药细胞株A2780-NiraR，并使用倒置相差显微镜观察A2780-NiraR细胞的形态特征，采用细胞毒性实验测定A2780-NiraR细胞对尼拉帕利的50%抑制浓度（IC50）。（2）通过活细胞计数（CCK-8）法、细胞直接计数法、流式细胞仪检测A2780-NiraR细胞的生物学特性。（3）采用基于超高效液相色谱/高分辨率质谱（UPLC/HRMS）检测的非靶向代谢组学技术筛选A2780细胞与A2780-NiraR细胞的差异代谢物，并行京都基因和基因组百科全书（KEGG）信号通路富集分析探究差异代谢物相关的信号通路。 结果： （1）与亲本细胞A2780比较，尼拉帕利耐药的A2780-NiraR细胞的形态以短梭形或卵圆形为主，突起变少，边界不清。A2780、A2780-NiraR细胞对尼拉帕利的IC50分别为3.17和26.19 μmol/L，两者比较，差异有统计学意义（F=98.50，P<0.001）。（2）A2780-NiraR细胞的增殖速度较A2780细胞显著变慢（F=146.80，P<0.001）；A2780-NiraR细胞的倍增时间为（37.5±1.9）h，显著长于A2780细胞的（14.5±1.0）h（t=10.50，P<0.001）。A2780-NiraR细胞的S期细胞比例为（30.2±2.9）%，显著低于A2780细胞的（44.5±0.7）%（t=4.78，P<0.001）；G0/G1期细胞比例为（52.2±3.1）%，显著高于A2780细胞的（35.4±1.2）%（t=5.10，P<0.001）。（3）采用非靶向代谢组学技术解析A2780和A2780-NiraR细胞的代谢物水平，基于正交偏最小二乘法-判别分析（OPLS-DA）筛选出A2780-NiraR细胞与A2780细胞的44种差异代谢物，其中在A2780-NiraR细胞中吡咯烷酮羧酸、L-赖氨酸和1-吡咯啉-4-羟基-2-羧酸盐等代谢物的含量显著增加；KEGG信号通路富集分析排序在前3位的信号通路为精氨酸代谢通路、嘌呤代谢通路和嘧啶代谢通路。 结论： A2780-NiraR细胞有稳定的尼拉帕利耐药性，精氨酸代谢等信号通路可能是导致卵巢癌尼拉帕利耐药的潜在靶途径。.",

    "title": "[Safety and efficacy of secondary cytoreductive surgery in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer after first-line PARPi maintenance therapy].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who progressed after first-line maintenance therapy with poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). Methods: Clinical pathological data and prognostic information were retrospectively collected from 30 ovarian cancer patients who underwent SCS between January 2018 and June 2024. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the second progression-free survival (PFS2) time and 3-year overall survival (OS) rate. Results: (1) Primary treatment: the median age at diagnosis was 51.3 years. A total of 40% (12/30) patients underwent primary debulking surgery with an expectation of achieving no gross residual disease (R0), while 60% (18/30) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 93% (28/30) of patients. BRCA1/2 gene testing was performed in 29 patients (testing rate 97%, 29/30), identifying 11 BRCA-mutated (37%, 11/30) and 18 BRCA wild-type (60%, 18/30) patients. The median duration of PARPi maintenance therapy among the 30 patients was 11.9 months; patients with BRCA gene mutations had a median duration of 19.2 months, while those with BRCA wild-type had a median duration of 10.1 months. (2) Secondary surgery: pathologically confirmed recurrence patterns, single lesion in 9 patients (30%, 9/30), oligo-lesion (2 lesions) in 3 patients (10%, 3/30), and multi-lesion (≥3 lesions) in 18 patients (60%, 18/30). Among the 30 patients, optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 97% (29/30) of SCS patients, with suboptimal cytoreduction in 1 patient (3%, 1/30). Adjuvant chemotherapy included platinum+paclitaxel in 24 (80%, 24/30) patients and platinum+liposomal doxorubicin in 6 (20%, 6/30) patients. PARPi re-treatment was administered to 17 patients (57%, 17/30) after chemotherapy. (3) Efficacy and safety: as of the follow-up cutoff in June 2024, the median follow-up time was 28.0 months. A total of 19 (63%, 19/30) patients experienced the next recurrence. The median PFS2 time after SCS was 18.5 months. Recurrence occurred in 7 BRCA-mutated and 12 BRCA gene wild-type patients. Median PFS2 time was significantly longer in BRCA-mutated patients compared to BRCA wild-type patients (25.7 vs 14.1 months; P=0.028). Three deaths occurred during follow-up, resulting in a 3-year OS rate of 90%. Among the 30 patients, postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients (13%, 4/30). One patient developed a ureteral fistula on 7 days post-SCS requiring ureteral stenting, and one patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on 1 day post-SCS due to hypovolemic shock. No deaths occurred within 30 days after SCS. Conclusion: For platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients progressed after first-line PARPi maintenance therapy who are anticipated to achieve R0 resection, SCS represents a safe and effective second-line treatment option. 目的： 探讨接受聚二磷酸腺苷核糖聚合酶抑制剂（PARPi）一线维持治疗后铂敏感复发卵巢上皮性癌（卵巢癌）患者接受二次肿瘤细胞减灭术（SCS）的疗效及安全性。 方法： 回顾性收集2018年1月至2024年6月接受SCS的30例PARPi一线维持治疗后铂敏感复发卵巢癌患者的临床病理资料及预后信息。采用Kaplan-Meier法对患者的二次疾病无进展生存（PFS2）时间及3年总生存（OS）率进行分析。 结果： （1）初始治疗时：30例患者确诊卵巢癌的中位年龄为51.3岁；40%（12/30）的患者预期可达无肉眼可见残留灶（R0）切除而行初次肿瘤细胞减灭术，60%（18/30）的患者行新辅助化疗+间歇性肿瘤细胞减灭术；93%（28/30）的患者达到了满意减瘤［包括R0和残留灶<1 cm（R1）切除］；29例患者行BRCA1/2基因检测，检测率97%（29/30），其中BRCA基因突变11例（37%，11/30）、BRCA基因野生型18例（60%，18/30）。30例患者的中位PARPi维持治疗时间为11.9个月，其中BRCA基因突变者为19.2个月、BRCA基因野生型者为10.1个月。（2）二次手术时：SCS术后病理检查显示，肿瘤单病灶、寡病灶（2个病灶）、多病灶（≥3个病灶）复发患者分别为9例（30%，9/30）、3例（10%，3/30）、18例（60%，18/30）。30例SCS术后患者中，29例（97%，29/30）达到满意减瘤，仅1例（3%，1/30）为不满意减瘤［残留灶≥1 cm（R2）切除］；24例（80%，24/30）接受铂类药物+紫杉醇方案化疗，6例（20%，6/30）患者接受铂类药物+脂质体多柔比星方案化疗；化疗后17例（57%，17/30）接受了PARPi再治疗。（3）疗效及安全性：随访截止至2024年6月，中位随访时间为28.0个月。随访期内19例（63%，19/30）患者二次复发，SCS后中位PFS2时间为18.5个月，其中7例BRCA基因突变患者的中位PFS2时间显著优于12例BRCA基因野生型患者（25.7、14.1个月；P=0.028）；随访期内3例患者死亡，3年OS率为90%。30例SCS患者中，4例（13%，4/30）出现SCS术后并发症，其中1例术后第1天因低血容量性休克转重症监护病房治疗，1例术后第7天出现输尿管瘘行输尿管支架置入术，2例切口延迟愈合。SCS手术后30 d内无死亡患者。 结论： 对于预期可达到R0切除的PARPi一线维持治疗后复发的铂敏感卵巢癌，SCS可作为安全且疗效可靠的二线治疗方案。.",

    "abstract": "A female patient in her sixth decade of life presented with a 7-day history of progressive diminution of vision and restricted ocular motility associated with fever, headache and vomiting. On general examination, she was febrile (temperature 100.4°F) and had enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, along with multiple nodules on the scalp and upper back. At baseline, ocular examination revealed visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and hand movements close to the face in the left eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left eye. The Hirschberg test revealed left esotropia (15°°) with an abduction deficit, suggestive of left sixth cranial nerve paresis. Fundus examination was unremarkable. A provisional diagnosis of left orbital apex syndrome (OAS) was made. A comprehensive work-up in neurology and dermatology was performed. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbit suggested an asymmetrically enhancing lesion of the cavernous sinus, soft tissue involvement of the left orbital apex and a nodule involving the white matter of the left parietal lobe. Hormone analysis suggested a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. Fine needle aspiration cytology of a submandibular lymph node and nodules of the scalp and upper back was suggestive of metastatic mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma. Tumour marker analysis revealed raised CEA and CA 125. Further, a positron emission tomography scan revealed active lesions in the lungs with multiorgan spread, supporting the diagnosis of primary lung carcinoma with disseminated metastases manifesting as OAS. In view of the poor prognosis, the patient refused further treatment and succumbed to her condition 1 month following her diagnosis.This case highlights the importance of recognising subtle ocular signs, as they can be indicative of underlying life-threatening conditions. Early detection and thorough investigation of such symptoms are crucial, as they can lead to the identification of serious systemic diseases, such as metastatic cancer, that may otherwise be overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Lagerstroemia speciosa is traditionally used for treating diabetes and inflammation; however, its anticancer potential remains unexplored. This study assesses the antioxidant and anticancer activities of L. speciosa bark extract, with a focus on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells in mice. The crude methanol extract (CME) was subdivided into n-hexane (NHF), chloroform (CHF), ethyl acetate (EAF), and aqueous (AQF) fractions. In vitro antioxidant assays identified CHF as the most active fraction, exhibiting high phenolic and flavonoid content. CHF and EAF were further investigated for anticancer activity in an EAC-induced mouse model, where CHF significantly (P < 0.05) reduced tumor cell count compared to EAF. Phytochemical characterization using FTIR and GC-MS revealed bioactive compounds, including 9-Methoxybicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene and 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (E,E). Molecular docking studies demonstrated strong interactions between these compounds and key cancer-related proteins, p53 and Topoisomerase-II, suggesting potential anticancer mechanisms. Overall, this study shows that L. speciosa bark extract has therapeutic potential, especially for CHF. Bioactive compounds like 9,12-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (E,E) and 9-methoxybicyclo [6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene contribute to the extract's antioxidant and anticancer effects in EAC models, possibly by modulating p53 and Topoisomerase-II.",

    "abstract": "Cancer burden has become a global concern, specifically with hormone-sensitive cancers (HSC). Among the various factors influencing the progress and treatment of cancers, the human microbiota plays a vital role. The current analysis explores the role of microbial metabolites in various regulatory pathways associated with cancer biomarkers and finds the common microbial metabolites associated with HSCs. AR, ESR1, and TP53 in breast cancer; ERBB2, MAPK21, and TP53 in ovarian cancer; AKT1, EGFR, and ERBB2 in endometrial cancer and AR, MYC, and RB1 in prostate cancer were identified as important genes in HSC development. The associated metabolites of these genes were contributing to various regulatory pathways. The metabolites hydrogen peroxide, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, guanosine diphosphate, and guanosine triphosphate produced by microbes within the humans were found to be involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism pathways. The purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway, arginine and proline pathway, and glycine, serine, and threonine pathways were found common and significantly enriched between human and microbial metabolites showing close association between the microbial metabolites and the HSCs. The microbes belonging to Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes phylum were found to be significantly associated with HSCs. The expression analysis and the similar pathways enriched between the correlated genes and hub genes validated the significance of the metabolites which can be used as potential biomarkers. Thus, the metabolic biomarkers can help in early diagnosis, targeted therapy based on the microbiome, and in prevention of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells and plasma metabolites may play important roles in the development of pulmonary diseases, but the relationship between different immune cells, plasma metabolites and various pulmonary diseases is still unclear. In this study, we aim to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causality between immune cells, pulmonary diseases and plasma metabolites. We analyzed immune cells and seven pulmonary diseases, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung cancer, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), and tuberculosis (TB), using genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) data for immune cells as an exposure factor and seven lung diseases as outcomes. Plasma metabolites GWAS data served as mediators. We applied MR analysis to explore the relationship between immune cells and pulmonary diseases, followed by two-step mediation analysis to identify potential metabolites that may mediate this association. As shown in the results, immune cells contribute to disease progression by reducing the protective effect of metabolites on disease or enhancing the promoting effect of metabolites on disease. These include CD4/CD8br and lung cancer, CD62L-CD86+ myeloid DC AC and Pneumonia, and Naive DN (CD4-CD8-) %T cell and COPD. On the other hand, immune cells suppress disease by increasing the inhibitory effect of metabolites on disease or decreasing the promoting effect of metabolites on disease, These include CD39 on CD39+ CD8br and ILD, CD28+ CD45RA+ CD8br AC and TB, Activated & secreting Treg AC and SAS, HLA DR on DC and IPF. We clarify the importance of the potential mechanisms pertaining to immune cells, metabolites, and pulmonary diseases, highlighting the complex interactions among these factors.

In Egypt, HCC poses a significant public-health concern, representing 47.17 % of cancer cases. The high incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Egypt was a major predisposing factor for HCC. This study included 63 Egyptian HCC patients, 55 % of whom had a history of HCV infection. Using a paired sampling strategy, approximately 2800 COSMIC mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes were NGS sequenced. Total of 381 somatic mutations were identified, 91 mutations detected in the HCC group and 291 in the HCV-related HCC group. The top 10 mutated genes in the non-HCV group were TP53, ATM, EGFR, CDH1, FGFR1, MET, SMAD4, ERBB2, FLT3, and FBXW7, while in the HCV-related HCC group, genes were KIT, ATM, TP53, APC, FBXW7, KDR, RB1, SMAD4, EGFR, and PIK3CA. The present study represents the first comprehensive somatic mutation profile in HCC Egyptian patients. This finding suggests that HCV viral infection played a direct and indirect role in increasing the somatic mutation burden in HCV-related HCC patients and opens new promises of targeted therapies for those patients.",

    "abstract": "The search for safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents remains a critical area of research due to the widespread impact of chronic inflammatory diseases. Natural compounds, particularly those derived from marine sources, present a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the potential of Chlorella vulgaris, a unicellular green alga with a rich profile of bioactive compounds, as a source of anti-inflammatory agents. Through in silico molecular docking and dynamics simulations, we identified compounds C8 and C4 as potent inhibitors of COX-1 and NIK, key targets in inflammatory pathways. These compounds demonstrated significantly stronger binding affinities than standard inhibitors MXM and OWC. For COX-1, C8 and C4 showed binding affinities of -8.625 and -4.359 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to -3.454 kcal/mol for MXM. Similarly, for NIK, the binding affinities were -6.798 and -3.789 kcal/mol for C8 and C4, respectively, compared to -2.628 kcal/mol for OWC. Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrated that C8 and C4 formed stable interactions, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, with key residues in the active sites of COX-1 and NIK, suggesting a potential for sustained inhibitory activity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of C. vulgaris derived compounds for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Although further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to fully elucidate their efficacy and safety, these results provide a promising foundation for the development of novel, naturally sourced anti-inflammatory therapies.",

    "abstract": "Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, but its early detection remains hindered by a lack of genetic markers. Our study aims to find prospective biomarkers that could serve as prognostic indicators and help in the identification of efficient drug candidates for KIRC treatment. Importantly, this study identifies the hub genes that play a crucial role in KIRC and their impact on male and female patients. The cBioPortal was used to identify frequently mutated genes across seven KIRC studies. Additionally, GSE168845 was employed to identify the differentially expressed genes. The analysis revealed that the titin (TTN) gene was mutated and upregulated in KIRC. Subsequently, differential genes of wild-type TTN versus mutant TTN were identified using TNMplot. The NetworkAnalyst tool was used to conduct KEGG analysis and PPI analysis on these genes. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier Plotter was utilized to perform overall survival analysis. Our findings indicated that the TTN gene leads to poorer prognosis in women than in men. We also discovered that the female-specific prolactin signaling pathway plays a significant role in the progression of KIRC. Moreover, our study suggested that the GDF15 gene, involved in the prolactin signaling pathway, has a worse prognosis for KIRC in women than in men. Additionally, mRNA expression analysis showed a negative correlation between GDF15 and MAPK14 in KIRC. Collectively, our research indicates that TTN, GDF15, and MAPK14 can serve as prognostic biomarkers in female KIRC patients, offering prospects for enhanced treatment and patient outcomes in these cancers.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a high recurrence rate after first-line immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. The presence of a high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HNSCC tumors was shown to be associated with improved clinical outcomes. One-time autologous TIL cell therapy was evaluated in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. C-145-03 (NCT03083873) was a phase 2 study of TIL in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC assigned to 1 of 4 treatment cohorts: cohort 1, non-cryopreserved TIL; cohort 2, cryopreserved lifileucel (22-day manufacturing); cohort 3, cryopreserved lifileucel (16-day manufacturing); cohort 4, cryopreserved LN-145-S1 programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) selected. Patients underwent tumor resection for TIL generation. After preparative non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, patients received a single infusion of TIL followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) infusion(s). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1. Secondary endpoints were investigator-assessed duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Overall, 53 patients received TIL: cohort 1 (n=8), cohort 2 (n=17), cohort 3 (n=16), cohort 4 (n=12). Median age was 57 years and most patients were males (87%; 46/53) with stage IV disease (98%; 52/53). Patients had a median of two prior lines of systemic therapy; 87% (46/53) of patients had prior anti-PD-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 therapy and 72% (38/53) had prior chemotherapy. The ORR was 11% (6/53) with six patients achieving partial response (cohort 1, n=3; cohort 2, n=1; cohort 4, n=2). At median follow-up of 17.9 months, the median DOR was 7.6 months. The DCR was 76% (40/53); 64% (34/53) of patients had stable disease. The safety profile was consistent with known toxicities associated with non-myeloablative lymphodepletion and IL-2 administration. This study demonstrated the feasibility of consistently generating sufficient TIL from HNSCC tumors. Results from this study suggest TIL cell therapy may serve as a potential treatment option for patients with HNSCC and support further development, including TIL cell therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other agents or with other TIL products.

    "title": "Exploring Targeted Delivery Systems for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy and Its Potential as a Promising Therapeutic Modality for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Background: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a precision binary radiotherapy. In this modality, thermal neutrons combine with 10B to induce a nuclear reaction that kills tumor cells. Its therapeutic efficacy depends on the targeted accumulation of boron delivery agents. BNCT has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating head and neck cancers and recurrent gliomas. However, there is limited evidence regarding its application in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review systematically examines recent advances in novel boron carriers. It also assesses the potential of BNCT for treating HCC and aims to provide a new therapeutic option for HCC. Methods: We used a systematic research approach to investigate the latest advances in novel boron carrier development. We also analyzed existing clinical data related to BNCT treatment for HCC. We aimed to systematically assess the feasibility and potential of applying BNCT to HCC. Results: Newly designed boron carriers show significantly enhanced targeted aggregation within tumor cells and reduced systemic toxicity compared to traditional carriers. Preliminary clinical studies have confirmed the potential efficacy of BNCT in inhibiting HCC growth. Notably, BNCT possesses the unique advantage of precise tumor targeting, which shows promising potential in minimizing damage to surrounding normal liver tissue. Conclusion: The progress made in the development of boron carriers has built a solid foundation for improving the efficacy and safety of BNCT treatment for HCC. By addressing current limitations in boron delivery and clinical evidence, BNCT has the potential to complement existing treatment modalities, improve outcomes for HCC patients, and provide new directions for the clinical treatment of HCC.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ultrasound (US) examination is the pivotal test to assess the risk of cancer and the indication for fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in thyroid nodules (TNs). The subcapsular location of a TN may strengthen the indication for FNAC as, in TN resulting malignant at cytology may favor surgery rather than active surveillance. However, the definition of a subcapsular TN remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the interobserver agreement (IOA) among thyroid US experts in classifying TNs as subcapsular or not. Methods: Twelve raters received an electronic link to a file containing static US images and were asked to assess 60 TNs for subcapsular location, blinded to all other TN characteristics. The overall IOA was calculated, and the TN US features were subsequently analyzed to evaluate their potential influence on interobserver variability. The raters had high or very high thyroid US experience. Two experienced operators preliminarily selected the case series and analyzed the findings. All cases were derived from patients undergoing surgery and histological diagnosis. The IOA was calculated according to Fleiss' kappa, ranging from 0.0 (no agreement) to 1.0 (perfect agreement). Results: The overall IOA was fair (κ = 0.34), with a slightly better result in the subgroup of raters with higher experience (κ = 0.39). A higher IOA value (κ = 0.38) was observed in TNs of medium size. Following multiple sub-analyses, the highest κ value (0.46) was observed in the subgroup of TNs that were categorized as EU-TIRADS 5 and were smaller than 2 cm. Conclusions: The overall IOA among US experts when assessing TNs as subcapsular was unsatisfactory. A clear and standardized definition of subcapsular position is needed to improve clinical decision-making. Future guidelines should address this issue to ensure consistent assessment and management of subcapsular TNs.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer represents a considerable global health challenge, mainly because of ineffective screening programs in middle-income countries. The current study aimed to forecast cervical cancer incidence by analyzing behavioral risk factors through logistic regression, employing feature engineering techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). PCA successfully condensed the dataset into ten principal components, capturing 89% of the variance, while stratified K-fold cross-validation ensured a balanced representation of classes. With the application of L1 regularization, the logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97.2%, an AUC of 98.1%, an F1 score of 97.2%, a specificity of 96.1%, and a log loss of 0.17. The performance of models was comparatively evaluated, and the results revealed that the logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.2% in comparison with decision trees at 93.33%, random forest at 93.33%, XGBoost at 93.33%, Naive Bayes at 91.67%, and non-regularized logistic regression at 87.55%. This research underscores the importance of early prediction of cervical cancer based on behavioral risk factors and suggests a robust, easily implementable workflow to improve classification accuracy. Future research should concentrate on refining these predictive tools to overcome social and behavioral barriers to prevention, particularly within underserved populations.",

A total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed using a SILS approach with one 3-mm needle forceps. To maintain adequate exposure without an assistant port, we utilized an adjustable organ retractor that allows multidirectional traction by repositioning external sutures. This technique provided stable visualization and facilitated a safe, oncologically appropriate dissection. The patient was discharged uneventfully without major complications and remains recurrence-free at 3 years.

We hypothesized that cystathionine (CTN) may be a new neuroblastoma biomarker and evaluated its utility for diagnosis and pretreatment risk assessment. 80 participants provided 202 urine samples: 32 from 32 control participants, 29 from 29 patients with primary neuroblastoma, and 141 from 30 patients with residual tumors, 11 of whom had primary neuroblastoma. Urinary CTN and HVA/VMA concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic and pretreatment risk assessment performance according to the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) pretreatment risk classification and the revised 2021 Children's Oncology Group (COG) neuroblastoma risk classification. Associations with prognostic factors were also evaluated. The AUC values for diagnosis were 0.920, 0.903, and 0.946 for HVA, VMA, and CTN, respectively. For pretreatment risk assessment (high-risk versus intermediate- and low-risk, and high- and intermediate-risk versus low-risk) the AUCs according to the INRG classification were 0.576 and 0.578 for HVA, 0.524 and 0.513 for VMA, and 0.852 and 0.708 for CTN, respectively, whereas they were 0.530 and 0.741 for HVA, 0.510 and 0.796 for VMA, and 0.758 and 0.981 for CTN, respectively, according to the COG classification. The values for MYCN status were 0.844 for HVA, 0.844 for VMA, and 0.942 for CTN. CTN may be a useful urinary marker for neuroblastoma diagnosis and pretreatment risk assessment.",

We sought to explore the feasibility of the new clip applier in robotic urologic surgery and compare it with the standard Weck® laparoscopic Hem-o-lok® clip applier. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 100 consecutive robotic urologic surgeries completed using the new clip applier by two surgeons was conducted from August 2024 to January 2025. The surgeries performed were robotic radical prostatectomy (RALP), robotic radical nephrectomy (RARN), and robotic partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Clips were applied during pelvic lymph node dissection in RALP, during ureteral transection in RARN, and during renorrhaphy in RAPN. Both ArtiSential (Group 1) and Hem-o-lok (Group 2) clips were applied during similar portions of the cases, with the latter group acting as a control. The number of successfully deployed clips (no misfires) was recorded and compared between groups. Subjective surgeon and bedside assistant approval was assessed using a dichotomous scale of yes/no for correct clip application. Cognitive load for the bedside assistant using the ArtiSential clip applier was measured using the NASA task load index (TLX). Results: A total of 340 clips in Group 1 and 360 clips in Group 2 were used. The percent of successful deployments of clips in Group 1 was 97.1% (330/340), while in Group 2 it was 94.4% (340/360) (p < 0.05). Subjective bedside assistant assessment of clip application was 91.2% accuracy in Group 1 (301/330 clips) and 87.6% accuracy in Group 2 (298/340 clips). Subjective surgeon assessment of clip application was 89.1% in Group 1 (294/330 clips) and 83.2% in Group 2 (283/340 clips). The mean NASA-TLX was significantly higher in Group 1 compared with Group 2. There was one reported lymphocele in Group 2. Conclusions: The ArtiSential clip applier is a double-jointed, multi-articulating laparoscopic clip applier that allows for improved accuracy of clip application when compared to standard Weck Hem-o-lok clip appliers in pelvic and retroperitoneal robotic urologic surgery.",

The sheep liver, closely resembling the human liver, emerges as a promising alternative for the advanced laparoscopic hepatic resection model. We aim to assess the suitability of the sheep liver as an animal training model for advanced laparoscopic hepatic surgery and identify potential limitations. This study, conducted at the 20th MESDA Conference in Bangkok on September 23-24, 2022, involved 10 sheep undergoing laparoscopic liver surgery training. Pre-training CT scans identified liver structures after general anesthesia administration. In groups of three, trainees performed live laparoscopic hepatic surgery on anesthetized sheep, with immediate feedback collected through post-training questionnaires assessing the clinical impact on live sheep models. 3D reconstructions revealed that 30% of sheep exhibited human-like ramification in the right portal vein (RPV), while 70% showed independent bifurcation patterns. The left portal vein (LPV) is consistently bifurcated into left medial and lateral sectoral branches, mimicking human anatomy. Hepatic vein drainage showed uniformity, with the right hepatic vein (RHV) forming a common trunk (MHV-like) before draining into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The participant's success rate was high, with 80.0% finding sheep model procedures realistic. Organ and tissue properties received high ratings, with 66.7% very high, 30.0% high, and 3.3% intermediate. Feasibility for advanced laparoscopic liver surgery on sheep models was very high (80.0%) and high (20.0%); overall, 76.7% rated laparoscopic liver surgery training very high in learning success. This study underscores the effectiveness of sheep liver as a suitable model for advanced laparoscopic hepatic resection training. Further research is needed to assess the model's effectiveness and limitations in specific laparoscopic hepatic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recently, opportunities for women to assume active roles are expanding, but it is noteworthy that the representation of female surgeons remains still low. As minimally invasive surgery penetrates, physical limitations such as muscle strength are diminishing. This evolution reduces obstacles and enhances the potential to widen opportunities for female surgeons to actively work. This study retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes of patients who received laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) (2013-2023) performed by resident surgeons as a primary operator. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether the primary surgeon was female or male. Perioperative outcomes and prognosis were examined after propensity score matching (PSM). Overall, 417 patients were eligible, and 24 resident surgeons operated, 7 female (29%) and 17 male (71%). After PSM, 107 patients were extracted for each group. No significant differences were observed in patients' baseline. Operation time (225 vs. 221 min), intraoperative blood loss (10 vs. 14 g), and postoperative hospital stay (8 vs. 8 days) did not differ. The incidence of postoperative complications (all-grade) was 9% vs. 18%. The calculated risk ratio of the female surgeons was 0.53 (95% confidence intervals: 0.26-1.08) (p = 0.08), which upper limit was lower than the prespecified non-inferior margin (1.2), thus the non-inferiority was proved. We found no gender difference in clinical outcomes of LDG performed by resident surgeons. The results of this study help us understand the role of female surgeons and encourage women to apply for surgical positions in the future.",

In this study, we aimed to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of serious hypotension following intravenous AAP administration during fever in patients with hematologic malignancies. This retrospective study included hospitalized patients in the hemato-oncology department. Patients were evaluated for serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) resulting from intravenous administration of AAP between January and December 2023 at a tertiary hospital. The control group comprised patients who received intravenous AAP but did not experience hypotension. After univariable analysis, multivariable analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for serious hypotension. The serious hypotension group included 37 patients, while the control group had 111 patients randomized in a 1:3 ratio based on age and sex. Three risk factors were identified as increasing the likelihood of serious hypotension: body temperature prior to administration, acute kidney injury, and bacteremia. The mean arterial pressure prior to administration decreased the risk of developing serious hypotension by 0.96 times with an increase of 1 mmHg. There were no significant differences in the length of hospitalization or 90-day mortality between the two groups. Given that patients with hematologic malignancies and associated risk factors may develop serious hypotension that can lead to death, it is essential to closely monitor blood pressure during intravenous administration of AAP.",

This study evaluates the additional therapeutic value of drugs approved by Health Canada through Project Orbis. The FDA list of drugs approved through Project Orbis until the end of 2024 was downloaded and drugs that Health Canada participated in were identified. The type of approval that Health Canada gave these drugs - standard, priority and Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c, conditional approval) was identified. The additional therapeutic value of the drugs (major, moderate and minor) was assessed from the ratings of four international organizations. The distribution of additional therapeutic value (minor, moderate, major) according to review type was compared using a Chi-square test. The FDA approved 68 drugs for 112 indications of which 49 (72.1%) drugs were reviewed by Health Canada for 78 (69.6%) indications (30 new drugs and 48 new indications for existing drugs). The manufacturer withdrew one drug from the approval process leaving 77 new drugs and new indications for analysis. Twenty-eight drugs had a standard review, 31 a priority review and 18 a NOC/c review. The distribution of additional therapeutic value by review type was statistically significantly different, p = 0.0052 (Chi-square test). Sixteen (69.6%) out of 23 drugs with a priority review offered either moderate (10) or major (6) additional therapeutic gains. Only 12 of the remaining 40 drugs with a therapeutic evaluation that had other types of approval had moderate or major additional therapeutic value.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of jaw resection (JR) and neck dissection (ND) on the incidence of jaw osteoradionecrosis (JORN) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) who underwent head and neck radiotherapy (HNR) involving the jawbone with/without ablative surgery. Evidence on this association remains scarce. This retrospective study examined irradiated HNC patients treated at a German university hospital between 2007 and 2022, with follow-up until December 2024. The predictor variables were JR and ND, with JORN as the main outcome. Appropriate statistics were computed with a significance level of P ≤ 0.005. Of 510 subjects (22.9% female; mean age 61.8±11.1 years [range, 14-92]), 14.7% developed JORN. JR and ND significantly increased JORN occurrence (75/510; P < 0.0001; odds ratio [OR], 3.67 [95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-6.65]; number needed to harm [NNH], 7.05; post hoc power, 99.7%). After adjusting for confounders, only JR remained an independent predictor for JORN (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.08-1.24]; Pearson's r = 0.18; P = 0.0005). JORN rates rose from 6.7% with HNR alone to 16.5-42.9% with additional JR and/or ND. JR increases the likelihood of JORN by up to 16% compared with HNR alone. Approximately one in seven irradiated HNC patients with ablative surgery develops JORN (NNH, 7.05). Increasing the extent of JR and/or ND does not meaningfully affect the risk of JORN (Pearson's r < 0.3).",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) must effectively communicate their uncertainty to be viable in clinical settings. As such, the need for reliable uncertainty estimation grows increasingly urgent with the expanding use of LLMs for information extraction from electronic health records. Previous token-level uncertainty estimators have only used token probabilities within a single output sequence. Here, by leveraging the constraints of JSON output structure, we instead consider all likely sequences and their respective probabilities to obtain a more robust measure of model confidence. We develop Certainty Retrieval Token Search (CeRTS), a new uncertainty estimator for structured information extraction. We evaluated CeRTS against a previous gold-standard uncertainty estimator when extracting clinical features from lung cancer discharge summaries across eight open-source LLMs. Calibration (Brier score) and discrimination (AUROC) were used to quantify performance. CeRTS surpassed the previous gold-standard estimator in discriminatory power across every model and achieved better calibration in most cases. CeRTS had the strongest agreement between model confidence and accuracy with Qwen-2.5. CeRTS enhances LLM-based information extraction from unstructured clinical text by assigning well-calibrated confidence scores to each extracted item, providing medical researchers with a quantitative measure of reliability at minimal additional cost. Although its performance was generally robust, CeRTS struggled with DeepSeek-R1, which we attribute to the model's Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps. Our evaluation focused on clinical data, but CeRTS can be applied to any domain requiring reliable uncertainty estimation.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases yearly. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, has gained extensive attention in cancer research. RNA-binding motif single-stranded interacting protein 2 (RBMS2) has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in CRC and its involvement with ferroptosis remains poorly understood. This study explores the involvement of RBMS2 in CRC development and its potential as a therapeutic target. Functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell migration, invasion assays, and EMT-related gene determination, were conducted to evaluate the effects of RBMS2 overexpression and knockdown. Ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy were assessed using specific inhibitors, ferroptosis inducers, and apoptosis and proliferation detection. The interaction between RBMS2 and SLC7A11 was explored during the ferroptosis process. In vivo experiments involved xenograft models in nude mice to observe tumor growth, EMT, and metastasis. Overexpression of RBMS2 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, RBMS2 promoted ferroptosis by downregulating SLC7A11. Mechanistic studies revealed that RBMS2 destabilizes SLC7A11 at the mRNA level. In vivo, RBMS2 overexpression significantly suppressed tumor growth and lung/liver metastasis. Our findings indicate that RBMS2 inhibits CRC progression by promoting ferroptosis and regulating SLC7A11 mRNA stability. Targeting the RBMS2-SLC7A11 axis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC.",

    "abstract": "New therapeutic approaches are essential in the fight against breast cancer, which remains one of the top causes of mortality globally. Innovative and efficient methods of treating and preventing cancer has become expedient since its incidence rates are rising globally. Combining herbal extracts and chemotherapy have drawn a lot of attention in recent times as a cutting-edge cancer prevention approach. The wild parasitic plant Loranthus micranthus is extensively distributed throughout the world and is well-known for its therapeutic uses. Previous preclinical investigations indicated that the leaves and stem extracts of L. micranthus had the potential to suppress breast cancer. Investigating the anticancer effects of L. micranthus extracts through network pharmacology analysis, in vitro and in vivo experiments is the goal of the current study. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 207 targets and 30 bioactive phytoconstituents of L. micranthus associated with the metabolism of breast cancer. L. micranthus controlled the metabolism of tryptophan and nitrogen in breast cancer, according to KEGG analysis and in silico models. The results of the experiment showed that L. micranthus significantly reduced the synthesis of kynurenine in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated breast cancer cells, downregulated important proteins involved in tryptophan catabolism, and produced no cytotoxic effects in human breast cancer cells (MCF 7 and MDA-MB 231) at the administered doses. The viability of T cells co-cultured with IFN-γ-treated breast cancer cells was also markedly enhanced by L. micranthus pre-treatment. The in vivo investigation showed a similar outcome, with L. micranthus treatment suppressing the inflammatory response, IDO activity/expression, lowering kynurenine levels, blocking CTLA-4 immune checkpoint and finally increasing the CD4+ T cell population in rats with DMBA-induced breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a natural indole derivative found in fruits and vegetables, known for its pharmacological properties, including anticancer activity. Neuroblastomas (NB) are the most common extracranial tumors in children, accounting for approximately 10% of all pediatric malignancies. Around half of NB cases are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the ALK gene. In this study, we selected the SH-SY5Y cell line as an in vitro model of human neuroblastoma to investigate the potential use of IAA as an effective anti-proliferative agent. First, we examined the effects of IAA on SH-SY5Y cells and, in parallel, on non-cancerous ARPE-19 retinal pigment epithelial cells, assessing cell viability. We found that IAA treatment consistently reduced cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells. This reduction in viability was accompanied by a stronger inhibition of ALK expression in SH-SY5Y cells compared to ARPE-19 cells. Next, we evaluated the impact of IAA treatment on cell cycle progression and autophagy. Our results revealed that IAA induces a dose-dependent G1 arrest within 24 h of exposure and upregulates key autophagy-related proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, IAA treatment inhibited colony formation and cell migration in SH-SY5Y cells, even at the lowest concentration. Altogether, our findings indicate that IAA exerts anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting cell viability and ALK expression, cell cycle progression, and suppressing colony formation and migration, with minimal impact on non-cancerous ARPE-19 cells. However, additional mechanisms may contribute to its activity. Further studies in different cellular contexts are needed to clarify its clinical potential and therapeutic relevance in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ampelopsis grossedentata (AG) is a popular folk tea that has been used in China for more than 1000 years. It is noteworthy that AG is widely recognized for preventing alcohol hangover in folk, and its protective effects on alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis have been demonstrated. Alcohol overconsumption can induce acute duodenal injury (ADI) that lacks effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the gastrointestinal protective effects of AG on alcoholic ADI in mice. AG extract was chemically characterized by HPLC analysis. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were pre-administered AG extract via gavage, and then subjected to an ethanol-induced ADI. After treatment, duodenal tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence. Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify the differentially expressed metabolites, and the gene expressions of duodenal tissues were determined using RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Acute ethanol administration caused severe duodenal damage, characterized by necrosis and shedding of duodenal villi, hemorrhagic injury, mucosal edema, and disruption of intestinal barrier in mice, which was improved by the pre-treatment with AG extract. Notably, administration of AG aqueous extract suppressed ethanol-induced duodenal villous apoptosis in mice by inhibiting caspase-3/7. In addition, untargeted metabolomics data showed AG extract improved ethanol-induced disruption of amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, and increased the levels of amino acids, such as L-serine, L-histidine, L-leucine, L-glutamine and L-tryptophan. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ethanol intake activated TNF, IL-17, MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and these pathways were inhibited by AG extract pre-treatment. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry results showed AG extract reduced the expressions of TNF-a, FADD, TRADD, RIPK1 and caspase-8 activity in duodenal tissue in ethanol-fed mice. In addition, western blotting data showed that pre-treatment with AG extract suppressed ethanol-induced activation of IL-17 and MAPK pathways. In conclusion, pre-treatment with AG inhibited ethanol-induced apoptosis of duodenal villi, disruption of intestinal barrier and amino acids metabolic disturbance. AG extract inhibited the TNF-a/FADD/caspase-8 and IL-17/MAPK signaling pathways. These findings highlight the gastrointestinal protective effects of AG extract against alcoholic ADI, and support its application as a duodenal protectant in drug development and dietary supplements.",

    "abstract": "The CHAARTED trial investigated the long-term survival of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without docetaxel (D). This analysis focuses on 10-year overall survival (OS) stratified by disease volume and on-therapy PSA levels at 6 months. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method from randomization to death or last known alive date. Patients were grouped based on baseline disease characteristics (high-volume/HV or low-volume/LV) and PSA levels at 6 months (<0.2 ng/mL vs. ≥0.2 ng/mL). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate correlation of PSA nadir with overall survival (OS) adjusted for treatment arm, disease volume, Gleason score, and prior local therapy. Of 790 patients, 225 were without recorded death after a median follow-up of 10 years. The 10-year OS was 25.9% (ADT+D) vs. 22.5% (ADT; HR: 0.78; p=0.004). HV patients treated with docetaxel had significantly higher OS (20.9% vs. 11.4%; p<0.0001). PSA <0.2 ng/mL at 6 months was associated with improved median OS in both ADT+D (100.3 vs. 45.4 months; p<0.0001) and ADT (116.8 vs. 31.8 months; p<0.0001) arms. PSA nadir <0.2 at 6 months was an independent predictor of improved OS (HR: 0.41; p<0.0001) adjusting for disease volume, prior local therapy, gleason score and treatment arm. Long-term follow-up confirms that ADT+D significantly improves OS in mHSPC patients with in HV disease. PSA nadir <0.2 ng/mL at 6 months is a strong prognostic marker for OS, supporting its use in response-adapted de-escalation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES) consists of dispersed neuroendocrine (NE) cells that bridge nervous, immune, and endocrine pathways across organs. Evolutionarily, DNES traces to primitive metazoans where single cells combined neural and immune roles, later diversifying into specialized vertebrate NE cells. Hallmark traits include dense-core granules, amine metabolism, \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, and regulation by ASCL1, NEUROG3, and INSM1. Remarkable plasticity allows immune and epithelial cells to acquire NE features under stress, while carcinomas exploit this program to form aggressive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and resist therapy. Canonical neuroimmune circuits, the Vagus-driven inflammatory reflex and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis, illustrate DNES coordination of systemic responses. Clinically, DNES-derived neoplasms span multiple organs, produce diverse hormonal syndromes, and are managed with somatostatin analogues, epigenetic drugs, and emerging immunotherapies. Recognizing DNES as a diffuse, integrative regulatory network clarifies mechanisms of chronic inflammation and cancer evolution and offers novel therapeutic entry points for disorders ranging from asthma to pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.",

Contours for 31 OARs generated by the software were compared to clinical contours using multiple accuracy metrics, including: Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 Percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95), surface DSC, as well as relative added path length (RAPL) as an efficiency metric. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to quantify variability in contouring accuracy across software platforms (inter-software) and patients (inter-patient). Pairwise comparisons were performed to categorize the software into different performance groups, and inter-software variations (ISV) were calculated as the average performance differences between the groups. Significant inter-software and inter-patient contouring accuracy variations (p<0.05) were observed for most OARs. The largest ISV in DSC in each anatomical region were cervical esophagus (0.41), trachea (0.10), spinal cord (0.13) and prostate (0.17). Among the organs evaluated, 7 had mean DSC >0.9 (i.e., heart, liver), 15 had DSC ranging from 0.7 to 0.89 (i.e., parotid, esophagus). The remaining organs (i.e., optic nerves, seminal vesicle) had DSC<0.7. 16 of the 31 organs (52%) had RAPL less than 0.1. Our results reveal significant inter-software and inter-patient variability in the performance of AI-segmentation software. These findings highlight the need of thorough software commissioning, testing, and quality assurance across disease sites, patient-specific anatomies and image acquisition protocols.",

    "abstract": "The vast geography and sparse population of Canada pose substantial challenges to delivering radiotherapy services. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to characterize the geographic accessibility of radiotherapy in Canada and investigate where future radiotherapy facilities can be optimally located. Demographic and human geographic data were extracted from the 2021 Canadian Census for 57,937 dissemination areas (geographically stable regions of approximately 500-700 persons), and active facilities providing megavoltage external beam radiotherapy were located using national and international directories. Logistic regression models were then used to analyze demographic factors associated with poor access to radiotherapy, defined as the absence of radiotherapy facilities within a 2-hour one-way driving radius. To inform planning efforts, we evaluated the impact of constructing a new radiotherapy facility in each dissemination area using multiple metrics of geographic access. The median driving time of the Canadian population to their nearest radiotherapy facility was 22.8 minutes. A total of 3,445,472 persons (9.3%) had poor access to radiotherapy in Canada, with significant variations by province (range, 4-48%). Seniors over age 65, males, low-income individuals, internal migrants within Canada, and Indigenous people had higher odds of experiencing poor access to radiotherapy. In contrast, visible minorities, immigrants to Canada, and individuals with post-secondary education had lower odds of experiencing poor access. We identified eight locations across Canada where a new radiotherapy facility could achieve change-in-access metrics comparable or superior to those of recently opened facilities; establishing new facilities at all eight locations could reduce the population with poor access by 1,127,127 (32.7%). We found significant geographic and demographic disparities in access to radiotherapy across Canada. This study provides evidence that additional radiotherapy facilities are required to address existing inequities and better serve vulnerable populations, and the potential locations for new facilities that we identified can guide stakeholders in planning these expansions.",

Consequently, we evaluated cardiac dose and overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for N2 disease. 155 patients comprised the final cohort, all treated for N2 disease. Cox proportional hazards testing for OS was performed across a wide range of clinical variables. Additionally, we evaluated factors that impacted cardiac dose. We performed multivariable analysis (MVA) using elastic net survival regression. We tuned the model's hyperparameters with Bayesian methods and conducted a variable importance analysis on the resultant model. Lastly, we analyzed relevant features after correcting for multiple comparisons. The internal target volume (ITV)/lung volume ratio was overwhelmingly the most important variable, although chemoradiotherapy sequencing played a small role. Cardiac dose significantly increased with increasing tumor volume and involvement of \"peri-cardial\" lymph node stations (4R/L and/or stations 7-12). After incorporating these factors, no cardiac dosimetric variables remained significant. Cardiac dosimetric variables did not impact upon OS in MVA. OS was overwhelmingly determined by the ITV/lung ratio. Furthermore, increasing cardiac dose was directly impacted by increasing tumor volume, number of \"pericardial\" lymph node stations involved, and/or treatment of hilar lymph nodes, all of which are eponymous for increasing tumor stage.",

Brain MRI data and clinical characteristics from 110 GBM patients were divided into a training set (n = 68) and a validation set (n = 42). Pre-operative and post-operative CET1 images were used individually and combined. A Vision Transformer (ViT) model was built using expert-segmented tumor images to extract DL features. Several mainstream convolutional neural network (CNN) models (DenseNet121, Inception_v3, MobileNet_v2, ResNet18, ResNet50, and VGG16) were built for comparative evaluation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression selected the significant features, classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Model performance was evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A multimodal model also incorporated DL features and clinical characteristics. The optimal input for predicting TuP versus PsP was the combination of pre- and post-operative CET1 tumor regions.

The patient presented with a 7-year history of progressive periocular BCC involving the medial canthus and nasal root. Given the lesion's proximity to ocular structures, a staged protocol was implemented with three preoperative PDT sessions administered weekly to reduce tumor burden. Gross tumor resection with 1-2 mm margins was then performed, leaving the wound to heal by secondary intention. Immediate postoperative PDT was followed by a second PDT cycle of three weekly sessions. Preoperative PDT achieved significant tumor regression. Surgical excision proceeded with minimal tissue loss. Subsequent histopathology of the specimen revealed positive peripheral margins, retrospectively validating the necessity of the PDT for treating residual disease. No recurrence was observed over a 5-year follow-up, and the healed scar was flat, pliable, and caused no functional or significant cosmetic concern to the patient. The combined approach preserved anatomical integrity and function while avoiding extensive reconstructive surgery risks. It offers a viable alternative to radical excision, balancing oncologic outcomes with functional and cosmetic preservation.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have confirmed that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is widely expressed in various malignant tumors. However, no systematic study has assessed the expression of IMP3 in bone tumors. We immunohistochemically examined 1,381 bone tumor specimens for IMP3 expression, analyzed its differential expression among various types of bone tumors, and evaluated its potential application in surgical pathology. Our results demonstrated that IMP3 positivity was observed in 7.5% (55/732) of benign bone tumors and 55.2% (358/649) of malignant bone tumors, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001). Notably, higher levels of IMP3 expression were observed in high-grade malignant bone tumors than in their low-grade counterparts. The incidence of IMP3 positivity exceeds 80% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade osteosarcoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Additionally, we detected IMP3 positivity in 63.5% (80/126) of metastatic bone cancers, specifically in 83.6% (46/55) of lung cancers, 70% (7/10) of liver cancers, and 87.5% (7/8) of colorectal cancers. We also observed high levels of IMP3 expression in three benign bone tumor types: chondroblastoma, epithelioid hemangioma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In conclusion, IMP3 immunostaining may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for malignant bone tumors, especially osteosarcoma and lymphoma. The high expression of IMP3 observed in bone metastases of lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer indicates that IMP3 could be associated with bone metastasis in these malignancies. Future research should focus on elucidating the relationship between IMP3 expression and various clinicopathological parameters as well as prognostic outcomes in malignant bone tumors.",

After considering all covariates, chewing difficulty was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to neoplasms (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30) and circulatory diseases (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), swallowing problems was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to nervous system diseases (HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47) and respiratory diseases (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.70), and xerostomia was significantly associated with high mortality risk due to nervous system diseases (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.20-2.92), circulatory diseases (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.37) and respiratory diseases (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.58), respectively. The present results suggest that poor oral functioning, including chewing difficulty, swallowing problems and xerostomia, could amplify the risk of mortality due to specific diseases. Dental and medical professionals should pay more attention to older adults with poor oral function to prevent subsequent critical health issues. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; ••: ••-••.",

    "abstract": "Ecnoglutide is a novel biased GLP-1 receptor agonist that preferentially activates the cAMP pathway over β-arrestin recruitment. We aimed to assess both non-inferiority and superiority of ecnoglutide versus dulaglutide, also a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a 52-week, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 trial at 52 hospitals in China. Adults aged 18-75 years with a BMI of 20-35 kg/m2, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy were included. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous ecnoglutide (0·6 mg or 1·2 mg) or dulaglutide (1·5 mg) once weekly. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 32 (non-inferiority for ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg, with a 0·4% non-inferiority margin; superiority for ecnoglutide 1·2 mg) and was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (full analysis set). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one safety evaluation after starting treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05680129) and has ended. Between Jan 10 and May 30, 2023, 623 participants were randomly assigned, of whom 621 comprised the full analysis set (mean age 53·9 years [SD 10·1], 347 [56%] males, 274 [44%] females, and mean HbA1c 8·40% [SD 0·78]; 68·28 mmol/mol [8·56]; 206 in the ecnoglutide 0·6 mg group, 208 in the ecnoglutide 1·2 mg group, and 207 in the dulaglutide 1·5 mg group). At week 32, mean HbA1c reductions were 1·91% (SE 0·05; -20·86 mmol/mol [0·53]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg, 1·89% (0·05; -20·69 mmol/mol [0·54]) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg, and 1·65% (0·05; -18·02 mmol/mol [0·53]) with dulaglutide. Estimated treatment differences versus dulaglutide were -0·26% (95% CI -0·39 to -0·13; -2·84 mmol/mol [-4·29 to -1·38]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and -0·24% (-0·38 to -0·11; -2·67 mmol/mol [-4·14 to -1·20]; p=0·0002 for superiority) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg. HbA1c reductions were sustained to week 52. During the 52 weeks, six (3%) of 206 patients in the ecnoglutide 0·6 mg group, eight (4%) of 208 patients in the ecnoglutide 1·2 mg group, and six (3%) of 207 patients in the dulaglutide group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Once-weekly ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg were non-inferior to dulaglutide 1·5 mg in reducing HbA1c in adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy. Although the 1·2 mg dose showed statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline to week 32 than dulaglutide 1·5 mg, the difference was not considered clinically relevant. Both doses of ecnoglutide were well tolerated. These results suggest that ecnoglutide might offer a new treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Hangzhou Sciwind Biosciences.",

    "abstract": "Women with limited English proficiency continue experiencing an unequal cancer burden. Non-White immigrant women present with more advanced breast and cervical cancer than non-Hispanic Whites, attributed to significant cultural barriers as well as low health literacy in attempting to navigate the United States health care system for cancer screening. Community-based Health litEracy-focused intervention for breast and cervical Cancer Control (CHECC-uP) was an in-person, community health worker-led intervention, addressing both cultural and health literacy barriers through health literacy education and follow-up counseling with navigation assistance. The in-person program was tested in a large cluster-randomized trial and yielded high efficacy in promoting mammogram and Papanicolaou test screening in Korean-speaking women. With over 90% of Americans now having online access, the in-person program was adapted to web-based delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the web version of the intervention-e-CHECC-uP. A randomized pilot trial was conducted. A total of 40 women were enrolled and randomized (20 per arm). The study intervention consisted of web-based health literacy education followed by phone counseling with navigation assistance. Study assessments were done at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The study's primary outcomes were cancer screening behaviors verified by medical record review. Upon completion of final study assessments, intervention participants were invited to join postintervention interviews. In total, 34 women (intervention: n=15; control: n=19) completed the assessment at 6 months, yielding a retention rate of 85%. The intervention participants were highly satisfied with e-CHECC-uP with a median rating of 8 on a 10-point scale. Between-group differences in screening rates were 34.6%, 47.9%, and 37.5%, respectively, for completion of the mammogram, Papanicolaou test, and both at 6 months. We achieved a high retention rate and high participant satisfaction. Although the study was not powered for significance testing, the e-CHECC-uP intervention resulted in large group differences across all cancer screening outcomes in the pilot sample. Online technology can help address multiple logistical barriers associated with in-person intervention delivery. Our findings suggest that web-based delivery of CHECC-uP may be used to promote cancer screening among immigrant women with limited English proficiency, as a promising avenue to ultimately reduce health disparities in underserved communities.",

With a sensitivity of 85-97% and a specificity of 85-100%, it offers high diagnostic accuracy. By using core-needle biopsies, high-quality tissue samples can be obtained that enable molecular analyses for personalised therapy.At the same time, lung ablation has established itself as a valuable minimally invasive therapy. Procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation enable targeted tumour destruction, particularly in inoperable patients with NSCLC or lung metastases. Studies have shown a high level of local tumour control with acceptable complication rates. The combination of imaging and interventional technique significantly improves patient safety and treatment outcomes and offers good results with low complication rates.Overall, CT-guided puncture and ablation are integral components of modern lung cancer diagnostics for primary and secondary lung tumours, while offering a new treatment option and therapy. They offer precise, low-risk alternatives to invasive procedures and can therefore make a significant contribution to effective patient care.

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) readmission rates vary across geographic regions in the United States, yet the impact of external exposome factors, such as contextual-level social determinants of health (SDoH), on adverse HF outcomes is not well understood. This study aims to examine the association between external exposome factors and the risk of HF readmission and all-cause mortality using a data-driven approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from the OneFlorida+ Network, including patients hospitalized for HF (HHF) from 2016 to 2022. A total of 1308 external exposome factors, covering a wide range of SDoH (eg, economic stability, education, health care access, natural and built environments, and social context), were linked to patients' EHR data based on their county-level residential location. Patients were followed for 1 year after their first HHF to capture readmission and mortality events. We applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization to preselect candidate variables, followed by a 2-phase external exposome-wide association study using mixed-effects logistic regression to identify key factors associated with the composite outcome of 1-year HF readmission and mortality. Among 63,940 patients with HF (n=30,475, 48% women; mean age 65, SD 14 years), higher maximum temperature in May was significantly associated with increased risk of the composite outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06; P<.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations across age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and rural or urban strata. Using a data-driven approach, we found that elevated maximum temperature in May (late spring) was significantly associated with HF readmission and mortality in Florida. Further investigations are warranted to uncover the intricate mechanisms through which extreme heat potentially influences HF outcomes.",

    "title": "Care Coordination and Patient Satisfaction With Ambulatory Cancer Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Manitoba, Canada: Report of An Online Survey Study of Patient-Reported Experience Measures With Interpretation Guided by Fit Theory.",
    "abstract": "In Manitoba, Canada, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery included, but was not limited to, disruption of many routine health care services, and the rapid introduction of both social distancing and virtual care. Little was known about how COVID-19-related changes to cancer care delivery would impact patient satisfaction with care and care coordination. This report aims to present and interpret findings of an online survey of people with oncology-related conditions in Manitoba, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring patient satisfaction and care coordination. A link to an online survey was made available to patients receiving cancer treatment in Manitoba, Canada, between July 31, 2020, and February 28, 2022. The survey included validated patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) for patient satisfaction and care coordination. Analysis included the generation of descriptive statistics and logistic regression, including univariate and multivariate analysis using stepwise model building. The survey results were interpreted using fit theory as a theoretical lens. A total of 203 responses were collected, of which 154 had completed responses for all PREM measures and were included in the analysis. Response rate is estimated at 3.3%-2.0%. The average age was 65 (SD 11.7) years. Most respondents were male (n=79, 52.7%). Most respondents were being treated with curative intent (n=81, 53.6%). The most common type of cancer was breast (n=41, 26.6%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that ages 60-69 years were associated with above average patient satisfaction (OR 2.205, 95% CI 1.045-4.624; P=.04). Age <60 years (OR 0.437, 95% CI 0.204-0.934; P=.03) and European Cooperative Group functional status (ECOG) ≥2 (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.137-0.782; P=.01) were associated with below average patient satisfaction. Age <60 years, ECOG ≥2, and hematological cancer were selected through stepwise multivariate model building, resulting in an explanatory model (R2=0.129) of patient satisfaction. ECOG ≥2 was associated with below-average care coordination (OR 0.357, 95% CI 0.145-0.880; P=.03), and was the only identified predictor of care coordination, with no explanatory multivariate model generated. Fit theory supports that the level of patient satisfaction and care coordination in each population subset inversely reflects a relative level of unmet supportive care need. Survey respondents with poor functional status, those outside the 60-69 years age range, and those with nonhematological malignancies likely experience increased unmet supportive care needs compared with their counterparts. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings reflect transient phenomena related to the COVID-19 pandemic, selection biases associated with the survey method used, or underlying health care delivery inequities.",

    "abstract": "A comparative analysis of the International Academy of Cytology-International Agency for Research on Cancer-World Health Organization Reporting System for Head and Neck Cytopathology (WHO) and the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) was performed. A total of 2218 salivary gland fine-needle aspiration samples collected at the Institut Curie, Paris (1954-2022) were evaluated, with 1356 having histological follow-up. Samples were classified according to the MSRSGC (nondiagnostic [ND], nonneoplastic [NN], atypia of undetermined significance [AUS], benign neoplasm [BN], salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential [SUMP], suspicious for malignancy [SM], and malignant [M]) and the WHO system (insufficient/inadequate/nondiagnostic, benign, atypical, neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential [NUMP], suspicious for malignancy [SM], and malignant [M]). The risk of malignancy (ROM) was calculated for each category, and diagnostic performance metrics were assessed. In the MSRSGC, the ROM was ND, 50% (n = 2); NN, 16.8% (n = 149); AUS (no cases); BN, 4.3% (n = 514); SUMP, 50% (n = 2); SM, 56.1% (n = 66); and M, 98.2% (n = 623). In the WHO system, the ROM was insufficient/inadequate/nondiagnostic, 50% (n = 2); benign, 7.1% (n = 663); atypical (no cases); NUMP, 50% (n = 2); SM, 56.1% (n = 66); and M, 98.2% (n = 623). The WHO's \"benign\" category, which combines NN and BN, balanced the NN's higher ROM (16.8%) and BN's lower ROM (4.3%) into 7.1%. Excluding the ND and SUMP/NUMP categories, both systems demonstrated high diagnostic performance: sensitivity, 93.3%; specificity, 93.9%; positive predictive value, 94.2%; and negative predictive value, 92.9%. Both systems effectively identify malignancy. The WHO system's merger of NN and BN into the benign category streamlines reporting and reduces variability, although it may mask clinically significant differences between nonneoplastic and benign neoplastic lesions.",

Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB), posaconazole or micafungin as primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) in pediatric patients with acute leukemia. This retrospective observational study enrolled 95 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 70) or acute myeloid leukemia (n = 25), undergoing chemotherapy, including those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany. PAP regimens included L-AMB (1 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg twice weekly, intravenously), posaconazole (100-300 mg/day, according to blood concentration, orally or intravenously) and micafungin (1 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg twice weekly, intravenously). Thirty-four patients (35.8%) received L-AMB, 37 patients (38.9%) received posaconazole, and 24 patients (25.3%) received micafungin. Patients with a history of IFD or concurrent or changing PAP were excluded. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of breakthrough IFD, while secondary endpoint included IFD-free survival. Statistical analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Gray's test and Cox regression to evaluate IFD-free survival. The overall incidence of IFD was 14.7% (14 of 95 patients). IFD developed in 10 of 33 patients (29.4%) receiving L-AMB, in 4 of 38 (10.8%) patients receiving posaconazole and in none of the patients receiving micafungin. IFD-free survival was 70.6% in the L-AMB group, 89.2% in the posaconazole group and 100% in the micafungin group (p = 0.005, log-rank test). Significant differences were also observed in the cumulative incidences of breakthrough IFDs (p = 0.006) assessed by Gray's test. In multivariate Cox analysis, dichotomized prophylaxis regimes (posaconazole or micafungin vs. L-AMB) were independently associated with a reduced risk of IFD (HR = 0.244; 95% CI 0.076-0.777; p = 0.017). Age ≥ 10 years predicted inferior IFD-free survival (HR = 3.665; 95% CI 1.224-10.980; p = 0.020). We found a significant difference in efficacy between the three antifungal prophylaxis regimens. In our study, micafungin achieved the lowest IFD breakthrough rate. However, multicenter clinical studies would be needed to confirm the results.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are extensively used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. While these medications offer glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits, the risks have increased because of their potential impact on cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between GLP-1 RAs and CRC risk in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs. This study was conducted the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from inception to December 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed Studies analyzing the effects of GLP-1 RA on CRC risk in patients with T2DM. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for the quality assessment of the included cohort studies. Random-effects models were employed for the pooled analysis, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Seven retrospective cohort studies involving 5,066,681 patients were included. The pooled analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of CRC among patients receiving GLP-1 RAs (RR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.82-2.93; I2 = 36%; p < 0.0001). However, the incidence of CRC was not significantly associated with GLP-1 RA use compared with other drugs (OR, 1.73; 95% CI: 0.21-14.18, p = 0.61; I2 = 100%). Quality assessment indicated a low-to-moderate risk of bias across the included studies. Overall, this study suggests a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with GLP-1 RA use in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs. However, the incidence of CRC is not considerably high. These findings highlight the need for further long-term, large-scale clinical trials to elucidate the relationship between GLP-1 RAs and cancer risk. Clinicians should consider these results when prescribing GLP-1 RAs, particularly in patients with CRC risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with a debilitating bone disease that poses significant therapeutic challenges. MM bone disease is characterized by increased bone resorption and suppression of osteoblasts, which hinders the repair of damaged bone. Sclerostin, an antagonist of Wnt signaling, is elevated in MM patients, and its inhibition with a neutralizing antibody (Scl-ab) has been shown to restore osteoblast function in mouse models of MM. However, it remains unclear whether Scl-ab can promote skeletal repair, enable effective tumor control when combined with anti-cancer agents, or improve bone health in MM patients. To investigate these knowledge gaps, we used preclinical MM mouse models and patient-derived samples. We also characterize the impact of Scl-ab on cancer and osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse models through bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. Lastly, we performed a retrospective analysis of the efficacy of Scl-ab to improve bone health in patients with MM in remission. Scl-ab promoted skeletal repair and enabled tumor suppression by an anti-cancer agent in various animal models of established MM bone disease. MM tumors suppressed Wnt signaling and decreased the number of osteoblasts and osteo-CAR cells, and treatment with Scl-ab reversed these effects. Treatment with Scl-ab increased bone mass and repaired bone in patients with MM in remission, even when combined with maintenance chemotherapy. Our findings highlight the potent bone-healing effects of Scl-ab and its potential as an adjuvant to anti-cancer therapy, offering a promising approach to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life for MM patients.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies allow for detailed and accurate measurement of omics features within their biological context. The integration of different omics types creates heterogeneous datasets, presenting challenges in analysis due to variations in measurement units, sample numbers, and features. Currently, there is a lack of generalized guidelines for making decisions in multi-omics study design (MOSD), such as selecting an appropriate number of samples and features, type of preprocessing and integration for robust analysis results. We propose a suggestive guideline for MOSD, involving nine important factors: sample size, feature selection, preprocessing strategy, noise characterization, class balance, number of classes, cancer subtype combination, omics combination, and clinical features. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed MOSD guidelines, we designed and conducted seven benchmark tests using 10 clustering methods on various TCGA cancer datasets with an objective of clustering cancer subtypes. The results indicated robust performance in terms of cancer subtype discrimination when adhering to the following criteria: 26 or more samples per class, selecting less than 10% of omics features, maintaining a sample balance under a 3:1 ratio, and keeping the noise level below 30%. Feature selection was particularly important, improving clustering performance by 34%. These findings provide evidence-based recommendations for MOSD, enabling researchers to optimize analytical approaches and enhance the reliability of results across cancer datasets. The proposed MOSD framework offers a suggestive guideline addressing both computational and biological factors for multi-omics data integration.",

    "abstract": "Persistent pain after finishing breast cancer treatment is a common and disabling problem. The current state-of-the-art pain management advocates, in addition to biomedical (non-)pharmacological approaches, a biopsychosocial rehabilitation approach to address persistent pain, combining pain science education with promoting an active lifestyle through self-regulation techniques. We propose testing an innovative eHealth self-management support programme for this purpose in the breast cancer population with persistent pain after finishing cancer treatment. This delivery mode is believed to reduce barriers to pain self-management by providing timely, safe and cost-effective assistance addressing the biopsychosocial needs of patients. Utilising a chatbot format, the eHealth programme delivers pain science education and promotes physical activity (PA), personalised through decision-tree-based algorithms to support pain self-management. The programme aims to empower patients with understanding, coping skills and self-management techniques to reduce pain-related disability and enhance participation in daily life. The primary objective is to determine programme effectiveness compared with (1) usual care (superiority) and (2) a similar face-to-face pain self-management support programme (non-inferiority). A pragmatic, three-arm randomised controlled trial was started in April 2024 at the University Hospitals of Antwerp and Leuven and primary care settings in Belgium. Participants are breast cancer survivors with persistent pain after finishing cancer treatment. Two hundred seventy participants will be randomised to one of three trial arms: (1) eHealth self-management support programme, (2) usual care or (3) a face-to-face self-management support programme. The 'eHealth self-management support programme' begins with a pain science education (PSE) module to initially convey key pain-related concepts and provide personalised pain management tips. Then, the programme progresses to daily activity planning to promote an active lifestyle. Guided by the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model, participants set and review daily activity goals and track progress. The eHealth self-management programme uses a chatbot and is accessible on any digital device. The 'usual care programme' involves sending the participants a study-specific brochure by postal mail and does not include any formal PSE and/or PA programmes. They may pursue or continue self-initiated care. In Belgium, usual care primarily involves pharmacological treatment, general advice on PA and the provision of informational brochures. The 'face-to-face self-management support programme' mirrors the eHealth intervention, combining PSE with PA coaching. It starts with three individual sessions with a trained physical therapist for biopsychosocial assessment and PSE, followed by six sessions on goal setting and active lifestyle coaching. The educational content is delivered both verbally and in written form. The primary outcome will be pain-related disability 6 months after baseline assessment. As a key secondary outcome, the effect on pain beliefs and attitudes will be investigated after the educational part of the eHealth and face-to-face programme (ie, at 6 weeks after baseline). Other secondary outcomes related to other dimensions of pain and physical-, psychosocial- and health-economic outcomes will be assessed at 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months after baseline as well. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2024). The protocol has been approved by the ethical committee of the University Hospitals of Leuven and Antwerp. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations at congresses. Ethical Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven and Antwerp: BUN B3002023000132.

    "title": "Potential drug-drug interactions among hospitalised cardiac patients in Nepal: a prospective observational study.",
    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a significant concern for patients on complex therapeutic regimens, especially involving cardiovascular medications, which are frequently implicated in these interactions. This study used a standardised interaction database to determine the frequency, severity and risk factors associated with potential DDIs (pDDIs) among cardiovascular disease (CVD) in-patients. The prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Nepal from April 2024 to October 2024. A total of 106 eligible CVD in-patients were evaluated for pDDIs using the Lexicomp DDI checker database, and the interactions were categorised based on severity and risk rating. Binary logistic regression identified factors associated with pDDIs. The study identified 621 pDDIs using the Lexicomp database, with median values of 8 pDDIs per patient. Patients with at least one pDDI comprised 64.2% of the sample. Most pDDIs were of moderate severity (77.3%) with risk ratings of C (65.7%). The most common cardiovascular medications involved in the detected DDI pairs were diuretics (31.2%), antiplatelets and anticoagulants (23.8%) and calcium channel blockers (12.2%). Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that patients who stayed longer (adjusted OR (AOR) 9.08, 95% CI 1.027 to 80.216, p=0.047), those receiving more medications (AOR 18.85, 95% CI 2.975 to 119.370, p=0.002) and those who were admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit (AOR 16.31, 95% CI 2.728 to 97.461, p=0.002) were significantly more likely to experience pDDIs. This study found a higher prevalence of pDDIs. It is advisable to incorporate medication reviews into routine cardiac care and use a drug interaction checker to identify pDDIs.",

    "title": "Atypical Carcinoid of the Thymus: Early Diagnosis in a Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Background: Atypical carcinoid of the thymus is an exceptionally rare neuroendocrine tumor originating from neuroendocrine cells within the thymus. These tumors often present with no symptoms or with nonspecific clinical signs, making early diagnosis particularly challenging. Despite their rarity, atypical carcinoids are clinically significant due to their aggressive nature and relatively poor prognosis. Early detection and appropriate management are therefore crucial to improving patient outcomes. Results: In this report, we present the case of a 64-year-old patient in whom an atypical carcinoid of the thymus was incidentally discovered following a thoracic computed tomography scan performed for unrelated reasons. Imaging revealed a suspicious anterior mediastinal mass, which was subsequently surgically resected. Histopathological examination, supported by immunohistochemical analysis, confirmed the diagnosis of an atypical carcinoid of the thymus. The tumor demonstrated coexpression of epithelial and neuroendocrine markers, consistent with this rare entity. Conclusions: This case adds to the limited body of literature on atypical carcinoid of the thymus and highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis when evaluating anterior mediastinal masses. It also underscores the value of thorough radiological and pathological assessment in identifying early-stage disease, which may significantly influence prognosis and therapeutic strategies.",

We describe a new isotonic patient-reported outcome (PRO-ISO) Phase I design with the flexibility of allocating patients to lower, more tolerable regimens if a large number of PRO-DLT events are seen at higher doses. We conduct simulation studies of the operating characteristics of the design and compared them to the patient-reported outcomes continual reassessment method (PRO-CRM). We illustrate that the PRO-ISO makes appropriate dose assignments during the study to give investigators and reviewers an idea of how the method behaves. In simulation studies, the PRO-ISO demonstrates comparable performance to the PRO-CRM in terms of recommending target doses and allocating patients to these doses. It also performs well relative to a nonparametric optimal benchmark applied to the PRO setting. Finally, we extend our methodology to account for the problem of late-onset toxicities.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the cause of nearly all cervical and anal cancers and the majority of vaginal, oropharyngeal, vulvar, and penile cancers in the United States (US). A safe and effective vaccine for the most common cancer-causing HPV types has been available in the US since 2006; however, uptake among age-eligible children remains below that of vaccines administered at similar ages. Hesitancy fueled by misperceptions about the HPV vaccine may contribute to this gap. We assessed HPV vaccine misperceptions using a 12-item Likert scale in a population health assessment in a large county in California. We validated the scale using exploratory factor analysis and exploratory graph analysis. We further assessed concurrent validity by examining parent report of youth vaccination through weighted logistic regression. The HPV Vaccine Misperceptions scale had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94) and a strong primary dimension. Further, the 12-item scale sum score was associated with increased odds (Odds Ratioper SD = 2.09; 95 % Confidence Interval = 1.26-3.45) of age-eligible children being unvaccinated for HPV in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models. This Parent HPV Vaccine Misperceptions Scale can be used to identify parent barriers to vaccination for tailored health education to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in age-eligible children.",

    "abstract": "U2AF2 (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 2), a crucial spliceosome component regulating RNA splicing, plays a dual role in T-cell function and tumorigenesis. This study integrated multi-omics analysis with experimental validation to elucidate the oncogenic mechanisms of U2AF2 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). U2AF2 expression and its clinical significance were analysed using publicly available COAD transcriptomic and clinical datasets. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of COAD tissues and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to assess the association between U2AF2 expression and tumour immune microenvironment composition. The in vitro functional consequences of U2AF2 knockdown on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were evaluated in COAD cell lines (HCT116, HCT8) using specific assays. The results revealed that splicing factors play a key role in viral infection and regulating of T cell function in the CD4+ cell subsets. U2AF2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated in COAD patients and were strongly associated with poor prognosis. U2AF2 also exhibited high diagnostic efficiency in COAD and predicted poor overall and disease-free survival. Our study also revealed that high U2AF2 expression was significantly correlated with decreased infiltration levels in CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, U2AF2 knockdown significantly inhibited COAD cell proliferation and migration, while promoting apoptosis. We demonstrate U2AF2's dual oncogenic mechanisms, driving malignant transformation through aberrant RNA splicing and fostering immunosuppression by reshaping the tumour immune landscape. These findings establish U2AF2 as a promising novel therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for COAD.",

    "abstract": "Ascorbate (AA) is an essential antioxidant and enzymatic cofactor with emerging roles in epigenetic regulation, redox biology, and immune function. However, single-cell quantification of intracellular AA has remained technically challenging. Here, we present SALSA (Single-cell Ascorbate Level Sensing Assay), a novel flow cytometry-based method that enables sensitive, specific detection of intracellular AA at the single-cell level. Inspired by the mechanism of the in vitro AA assay, we identified 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2), a common nitric oxide (NO) probe, as a selective AA reporter. We showed that the chemical oxidation of AA into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) facilitated its reaction with DAF-2 to form a highly fluorescent product. Surprisingly, the DAF-2-DHA adduct exhibits a red-shifted emission spectrum distinguishable from those of DAF-2 alone or its NO-reactive product. This spectral shift enables the differentiation of signals into two channels, SALSAVerde (green) and SALSARoja (red-orange), with SALSARoja offering superior sensitivity and minimal NO interference. SALSA is quantitative, with a strong linear correlation between signal intensity and intracellular AA concentration. Using SALSA and CRISPR, we identified SVCT2 as the major AA transporter in a human cell line model. Applying SALSA to immune profiling revealed previously unappreciated heterogeneity in AA levels across immune subsets and developmental stages. Together, these findings establish SALSA as a robust and accessible method for probing AA dynamics at single-cell resolution, with broad potential applications in redox biology, immunology, and metabolism.",

Identifying key microRNAs can facilitate early diagnosis and expedite treatment and recovery by acting as crucial biomarkers in leukemia progression. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-155 and miR-181, have been linked to leukemia subtypes, influencing disease development and response to therapy. Recently, biosensors have emerged as a notable method for microRNA identification. These analytical devices possess high sensitivity and specificity for detecting biological agents. microRNA biosensors offer a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate approach to diagnosing leukemias.

    "abstract": "Isolating and identifying circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood presents a promising avenue for early cancer diagnosis, metastasis prevention, and timely therapeutic intervention. However, most current isolation techniques are costly, labor-intensive, and require complex labeling procedures. To address these problems, this study introduces a cost-effective and fully automated centrifugal microfluidic platform for the label-free separation and subsequent lysis of cancer cells from whole blood samples. The separation unit comprises a Y-shaped inlet, trapezoidal contraction-expansion array (CEA) microchannel, and bifurcated outlet, which collectively enhance the separation efficiency by harnessing four key hydrodynamic forces: the centrifugal force, Coriolis force, inertial lift force, and Dean drag force. Following the separation process, the disc rotation speed is increased to drive the cells through a serpentine mixing channel, where they mix with a lysis buffer and then flow into a collection chamber. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the fluid flow and particle behavior within the separation channel and lysis micromixer. Experiments are then conducted with K562 leukemia cells spiked into blood samples with different hematocrit levels. A peak separation efficiency of 91.8 % is obtained at a disc rotation speed of 2250 rpm. Moreover, the mixing performance reaches 94.8 % at 2750 rpm. The entire sample loading, cell separation, mixing, decanting, and lysis process is completed within two minutes. Thus, the proposed device shows significant potential as a rapid, user-friendly, and scalable solution for point-of-care cancer diagnosis.",

    "title": "Aberrant glycosylation in pulmonary fibrosis: Mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatment opportunities.",
    "abstract": "Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of scar tissue extending beyond the physiological healing process, ultimately leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. In many industrialized countries, fibrosis is a leading cause of mortality, contributing to approximately 45 % of deaths. Despite considerable advances in elucidating its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, current therapeutic strategies remain largely limited to palliative care. Consequently, there is an urgent demand for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the clinical management of fibrosis and the development of effective anti-fibrotic agents. Both clinical observations and experimental models underscore the multifaceted nature of fibrotic disorders, which contributes to the complexity of treatment. Recent investigations have focused on the epigenetic regulation, particularly post-translational modifications (PTMs), in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of fibrosis. PTMs, including glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, induce subtle yet functionally impactful alterations in protein structure and activity. Among these, glycosylation has garnered increasing attention due to its demonstrated therapeutic relevance in various pathological contexts, including cancer, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence now indicates that glycosylation plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of fibrosis. Technological advances in glycomics and glycoproteomics have substantially deepened our understanding of how glycosylation modulates the fibrotic processes. This review focuses on the role of protein glycosylation in pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting distinct glycosylation patterns and enzymatic alterations implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, it explores the potential of glycosylation-based biomarkers and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing its promise for improving clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies in fibrotic pathologies.",

The authors present a pediatric case of an IMSCMN involving the thoracic segment of the spinal cord. An 11-year-old previously healthy girl experienced intermittent low back pain for 5 months, followed by left foot drop, limb weakness, and abnormal gait. MRI revealed an intramedullary hemorrhagic spinal cord lesion at T9-11, with a long syrinx and cord edema. An MRI study of the brain and the remaining spinal cord was unremarkable.

A 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented with seizures, headaches, and photophobia. Initial suspicion of a metastatic brain tumor led to serial MRI studies, which revealed a migrating lesion in the right temporal lobe. During craniotomy, a motile helminth was surgically excised from the brain parenchyma. Histopathological analysis confirmed that the organism was an adult T. solium tapeworm, with taeniid eggs identified within the specimen, marking the first evidence of intracranial adult taeniasis and ectopic cerebral oviposition. The patient's prior oncological treatments, including mastectomy and postoperative therapies, raise hypotheses about immune or anatomical changes facilitating parasitic neuroinvasion. The discovery underscores critical gaps in diagnostics, as the lesion mimicked metastatic cancer radiologically, and therapeutics, as standard cysticidal drugs target larval stages, not adult worms. This report highlights the urgent need to investigate interactions between parasitic infections and oncological interventions.

Silibinin (SLB) is an effective agent causing apoptosis and autophagy resulting in cancer cell death. Recently, ligand-anchored targeted nanocarrier-based drug delivery has achieved substantial improvement in cancer therapy. In the present study, chondroitin sulfate (CS) was used as a ligand to target CD44 receptors overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Herein, CS-coated chitosan-lecithin nanoparticles (CS-DTX-SLB-LCNPs) were developed for co-delivery of DTX and SLB. The CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP resulted in a particle size of 208.33 ± 2.20 nm with an entrapment efficiency of 83.81% for DTX and 92.96% for SLB. Further, the dialysis release study showed sustained release behavior, and a hemocompatible nature which was proved by the hemolysis study. The cell cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed considerably higher cell killing with CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP compared to free drugs. The cell uptake studies showed a 1.97-fold and 2.45-fold rise in fluorescence intensity from C6-LCNP and CS-C6-LCNP, respectively, as compared to free C6. CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP caused a sharp rise in the ROS level and resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which induced apoptosis and cell death. An in vivo efficacy study in Balb/c mice demonstrated 2.24-fold and 2-fold reduction in tumor volume after CS-DTX-SLB-LCNP treatment as compared to free DTX and free SLB groups. In conclusion, CS-DTX-SLB-LCNPs showed encouraging prospects in increasing cellular uptake and targeting specificity to treat breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Bimetallic gold nanorods decorated with platinum islands (AuNRs@Pt) are widely recognized as promising photothermal agents due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects, which enable localized heat generation for photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, photodynamic therapy (PDT) using photosensitizers (PSs) offers synergistic potential for light-activated cancer treatment. This study investigates the fluorescence behavior and plasmon energy transfer mechanisms of dumbbell-shaped AuNRs@Pt with varying Pt coverages, functionalized with thiolated β-cyclodextrin (SH-βCD) as a host for methylene blue (MB), which serves as a PS. The synthesis and functionalization of AuNRs@Pt revealed tunable plasmon damping pathways, including chemical interface damping and metal interface damping, modulated by Pt deposition and host-guest supramolecular interactions. MB attachment induces plasmon damping, with LSPR damping increasing as the Pt content increases. Functionalization with SH-βCD alters the dielectric environment, while energy dissipation facilitated by Pt islands further amplifies LSPR damping. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the preferential host-guest interaction of MB with SH-βCD rather than direct interaction with the nanoparticle surface. Meanwhile, MB inclusion increased the local dielectric constant, resulting in redshifts. Notably, host-guest inclusion reduced fluorescence quenching and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nonradiative decay, enhancing MB fluorescence and optimizing its emission properties. Additionally, Pt content modulated radiative decay rates and fluorescence quantum yield, with Pt islands amplifying electromagnetic enhancements via the Purcell effect while simultaneously reducing FRET quenching. Therefore, this work lays the foundation for developing advanced theranostic nanoplatforms that leverage the synergy between plasmonic nanoparticles and fluorescence-active molecules for targeted cancer therapies.",

However, these strategies are challenged by the non-specific and \"always on\" innate immunostimulatory effects of adjuvants, largely impeding their clinical translation. In this study, we developed a novel LNP component, sono-adjuvant lipid, to endow clinically approved LNP formulations with region-confined adjuvanticity. The engineered ultrasound (US)-activatable LNP (ULNP) precisely boosted innate immune responses in the lymph nodes (LN) through US-triggered activation of the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways in APCs. Compared to conventional LNP integrating toll-like receptor adjuvant, the combination of ULNP with localized US stimulation (ULNP + US) not only enhanced LN-specific mRNA transfection but also elicited 2.5-fold higher antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses to inhibit established tumor growth. More importantly, the US-activatable adjuvanting strategy was readily applicable to potentiate tumor neoantigen-encoding circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine therapy. Combining circRNA-loaded ULNP (ci-ULNP) with US stimulation elicited potent antitumor T cell immunity and completely eliminated orthotopic liver tumors in mice. Overall, the sono-adjuvant lipid-integrated ULNP offered a robust platform for spatiotemporally tunable innate immune stimulation and mRNA vaccination therapy of cancer.",

Accurate noninvasive methods are needed to predict the histology of these masses, guiding treatment and reserving surgery for those with teratoma. This study aims to enhance predictive accuracy by integrating computed tomography (CT) radiomics features with miRNAs (miR371-375) to distinguish between teratoma and nonteratoma histology in postchemotherapy residual masses. We retrospectively identified 111 lesions, divided into training and test sets (n = 78 v 33) with equal class distribution. 3D Slicer was used to segment lesions with a short axis of >10 mm from the postchemo-presurgical CT images, and radiomics features were extracted. Presurgery plasma miR371-375 levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Four machine learning models evaluated the predictive value of radiomics alone (R-only) and combined with miR371-375 levels, and the best performer was selected. Clinical factors associated with teratoma from univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis with the best radiomics signature to assess their impact on predicting teratoma histology. The CatBoost (CB) model R + 371 + 375 exhibited the best and most robust overall accuracy for predicting residual teratoma, with the highest AUC values (0.96, 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.0 for training, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98 for testing) and a well-balanced sensitivity and specificity. Univariate analysis identified presurgery alpha-fetoprotein (P = .01), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (P = .01), initial teratoma pathology (P = .01), and lymph node metastases (P = .02) as significant predictors for teratoma. Multivariate analysis included these features and the radiomics signature, which was the strongest independent predictor (P < .0001). Combining miR371-375 with CT radiomics features improves the accuracy of predicting teratoma histology of postchemotherapy residual disease in mNSGCTs and, therefore, has the potential to guide treatment decision making.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of smartphone app-guided pulmonary rehabilitation in improving exercise capacity in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. This was a multicenter prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in 2022. A total of 100 participants with chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer, were recruited, with equal distribution (50:50) between the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group followed a 12-week app-guided rehabilitation program, while the control group received standard outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was the 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD) after the 12-week rehabilitation period. Secondary outcomes included quality of life questionnaires and health care usage. Among the 100 participants included, 88 completed the follow-up visit (41 in the intervention group and 47 in the control group). Their median age was 68.0 years, and 72 (81.8%) were men. Most participants (n=70, 79.5%) had a smoking history, with a median of 40.0 pack-years. Their forced expiratory volume in 1 second was a median of 63.0% (IQR 50.5-71.5). Most participants (n=85, 96.6%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After the 12-week rehabilitation program, 6MWD was not different between the intervention and control group (median 490.0, IQR 468.8-556.3 vs 485.0, IQR 440.0-527.3 m). Assuming a clinically minimal effective change of 25 meters in 6MWD, only 7 out of 41 participants among the intervention group achieved the minimal clinically important differences after the rehabilitation program. Quality of life questionnaire scores, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, did not differ between groups. In addition, none of the participants experienced hospitalization or emergency room visits during the study period. Regarding the service satisfaction questionnaire, more than 3-quarters of the intervention group (34/41) rated their scores as ≥17/20. In this study, smartphone app-guided pulmonary rehabilitation failed to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. However, the results indicated that older adults with chronic respiratory conditions can safely use smartphone app-guided pulmonary rehabilitation. Thus, smartphone app-guided pulmonary rehabilitation may be a feasible option for older adults with chronic respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "SMARCA4-deficient thoracic tumors (SDTTs) mainly include SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated thoracic tumor (SMARCA4-dUT) and SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (SMARCA4-dNSCLC). Comparative studies between these subtypes remain limited, and no standardized therapeutic guidelines have been established. This study retrospectively analyzed 102 patients with SDTT from January 2020 to May 2024. We evaluated the efficacy of different treatments for SDTT and compared the clinicopathological features and prognostic outcomes between SD-UT and SD-NSCLC. SDTT predominantly occurs in olderly male smokers. SMARCA4-dUT exhibits high NSE expression, higher risk of lymph node metastases, and lower rates of early diagnosis than SMARCA4-dNSCLC. SMARCA4-dNSCLC can be distinguished from SMARCA4-dUT by gland architecture and the diffuse expression of epithelial markers, whereas SMARCA4-dUT shows positive expression for Syn and stem cell markers. Common mutations include TP53, SMARCA4, KRAS, and STK11, with STK11/KRAS co-mutations associated with poorer prognosis. SMARCA4 protein loss was observed not only in class I mutations but also in class II mutations and wild-type cases. Both SMARCA4-dUT and SMARCA4-dNSCLC carry a high recurrence risk after radical treatment. Immune-based therapy significantly improved median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) compared with non-immunotherapy (mPFS, 8.6 vs. 3.3 months, P < 0.0001; mOS, 13.1 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.048). Central nervous system metastasis, pleura metastasis, and primary tumor resection were independent factors for OS. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of SDTT to date, based on a relatively large sample size. STK11/KRAS co-mutations are associated with poorer prognosis. SMARCA4-dNSCLC can be distinguished from SMARCA4-dUT by epithelial markers and stem cell markers. Immune-based therapy is the optimal option in the current treatment strategy.",

We addressed the role of immune surveillance in 76 cervical biopsies (normal = 23, HPV+ benign = 16, HPV+ precancer = 37) by studying the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and the expression of the immune modulators PDL1, ICOSL, and miR-155 and compared the data to 101 cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither miR-155 nor PDL1 were detected. MiR-155 was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection. Both PDL1 (95%) and ICOSL (89%) were only evident in the precancerous SIL and each localized to squamous cells in the basal aspect that lacked replicating virus. In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer miR-155 expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization. It is concluded that miR-155 expression is a marker of HPV infection in both benign and precancerous lesions, whereas the approximately 10% of the latter lesions that progress to cancer gain PDL1 and lose ICOSL expression, which are important factors in avoiding immune surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations-resembling human club and hillock cells-are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.",

Patients in this group are highly prone to develop embryonal tumors, most commonly medulloblastoma arising from the cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs). GCPs undergo high proliferation in the postnatal cerebellum under Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation, but the type of DNA lesions that require the function of the BRCA2 to prevent tumorigenesis remains unknown. To identify such lesions, we assessed both GCP neurodevelopment and tumor formation using a mouse model with deletion of exons three and four of Brca2 in the central nervous system, coupled with global Trp53 loss. Brca2Δex3-4;Trp53-/- animals developed SHH subgroup medulloblastomas with complete penetrance. Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). Brca2-deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. Pif1 helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and Pif1 knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.",

The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Task Force was formed by the four major neuroblastoma cooperative groups in 2004 to achieve this goal. Strategies developed for neuroblastoma are an exemplar for other rare malignancies. Data from an initial cohort of 8,800 patients were transferred to the INRG Data Commons, and a data-sharing model was developed. Currently, information on > 25,000 patients are available to the research community. The INRG staging and risk classification systems have led to harmonized approaches for therapeutic groupings. INRG consensus manuscripts have led to uniform criteria for classifying biological data, evaluating the extent of disease, and defining treatment response. More than forty INRG research studies have been performed by investigators from around the world, including analyses of rare patients which would not otherwise be possible. The success of this approach for neuroblastoma has been leveraged to create the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons and the Data for the Common Good. Efforts to enrich the INRG Commons with additional genomic and biomarker data, extracted electronic health records, and digital medical images are ongoing. The international networking model developed by the INRG Task Force has led to new research discoveries and progress in neuroblastoma. The approach has now been applied to sixteen other cancers and conditions, including rhabdomyosarcoma, germ cell tumor, Lynch Syndrome and cancer predisposition. This framework of international collaboration and data sharing serves as a model for advancing rare adult malignancies.",

Current exosome phenotyping methods suffer from insufficient sensitivity, limited multiplexing capability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, we developed a digital wafer-level micropillar array (WLM-Exo) platform. The chip features a high-surface-area micropillar array functionalized with a DSPE-PEG2000 lipid layer via Au-S bonding, enabling lipid-mediated membrane fusion for universal exosome enrichment and a uniform spatial distribution. Following capture, aptamer-based SERS nanotags bind specifically to target proteins on exosomes, generating distinct Raman signals upon laser excitation. Exosomal proteins are digitally quantified by measuring the activated area in the Raman images, exhibiting a log-log linear correlation with exosome concentration. The WLM-Exo platform demonstrates ultrasensitive detection (LOD: 2.11 particles/μL for CD63, 1.17 particles/μL for EpCAM, and 18.3 particles/μL for dual-biomarkers) and simultaneous tetra-color exosomal phenotyping capability. By enabling precise, scalable, and digital protein profiling, this technology offers significant potential for exosomes subtyping in personalized cancer diagnostics and therapeutics monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by core clock proteins, coordinate physiological functions with daily environmental fluctuations across organisms, from bacteria to humans. The circadian clock interacts with various biological processes, and its disruption is associated with numerous human diseases, including sleep disorders, metabolic syndrome, and potentially cancer. In mammals, the circadian clock is driven by cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs), in which CLOCK and BMAL1 act as transcriptional activators, while PER and CRY serve as transcriptional repressors. During the early repression phase, the CRY-PER-CK1 complex binds to CLOCK-BMAL1, displacing it from target promoters. In the late repression phase, in the absence of PER, CRY1 alone inhibits CLOCK-BMAL1 activity by blocking the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Biochemical and structural studies have highlighted the essential roles of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and posttranslational modifications in regulating the molecular clock. In this Review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms that govern the circadian clock and focus on the coordination of protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications, underscoring the importance of the circadian clock in disease progression and treatment strategies.",

Leveraging long-read sequencing, we successfully identified and characterized full-length isoforms, along with tumor-specific splicing events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our analysis identified 38,058 previously unannotated isoforms, which were subsequently validated using orthogonal multi-omics datasets to confirm their transcriptional and translational activities. Notably, 269 splicing events were characterized as tumor-specific, with 17 showing significant associations with NSCLC subtypes, while 13 were enriched across all NSCLC cases. Among these events, skipped exons in IFI27, PUF60 and ANAPC11, as well as an alternative first exon in YBEY, were absent from GENCODE annotations. These findings underscore the intricate complexity of isoforms and their clinical significance, particularly in terms of NSCLC subtype specificity and their potential as therapeutic targets. In conclusion, this study provides a valuable resource for the discovery of tumor-specific splicing targets in NSCLC, leveraging the unique advantages of long-read sequencing.",

The critical parameters that define the possible dynamical regimes are identified through linear stability analysis. The effects of both constant and periodic perturbations are examined, along with their clinical implications. The treatment dose required to drive the system to a desired state is determined. It is also shown that aggressive tumors evolve toward a limit cycle when the host is under the action of low-frequency periodic treatment. As the frequency increases, a transition to a non-chaotic attractor occurs. This transition narrows as the frequency of the external periodic perturbation increases. No chaotic behavior is observed, even at higher values of both perturbation strength and frequency, as the maximum Lyapunov exponent remains negative. These results suggest that although aggressive tumors may not be completely eradicated by conventional anticancer therapies, they could potentially be controlled through external low-frequency periodic treatments that target directly only the host, such as immunotherapy.",

It is well known that tag fusion can cause unwanted changes in protein stability, but whether this is an inherent property of the tagged protein, or can be influenced by the cell and tissue environment, is unclear. Using a series of genome edited mouse models, we show that tag-dependent changes in protein expression can vary across different primary cell and tissue contexts. In one case (Ncaph2), a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron fusion strongly increased protein stability in some tissues but decreased it in others. Destabilisation resulted from tissue-specific 'leakage' of the auxin-inducible degron, which depended on TIR1 expression, and occurred selectively in the small intestine where basal concentrations of auxin/ indole-3-acetic acid can reach levels that are sufficient to trigger protein degradation in cultured cells. Stabilisation occurred in post-mitotic cells via an endogenous degradation signal situated at the NCAPH2 C-terminus, which normally undergoes activation upon cell cycle exit, but is inactivated by C-terminal tag fusion. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of cell and tissue environment in determining the consequences of tag fusions on protein expression, which may be particularly important in animal models that contain diverse cell types.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cancer are at increased risk of thrombotic complications from both the disease and its treatments, with antithrombotic therapy (ATT) usually continued in the last phase of life where the benefit is less clear and there is high risk of harms. Physiological changes toward the end of life increase the risk that ATT will cause serious bleeding events, but discussion between clinicians and patients of ATT risks and benefits is sub-optimal. This realist synthesis explores shared decision-making (SDM) to: (a) provide insights into why prescribing continues in end-of-life care; (b) build a conceptual platform for optimizing ATT prescribing for persons living with cancer towards end-of-life. We conducted a realist synthesis using context-mechanism-outcome configurations and 'if…then' statements. A total of 17,036 citations identified across 10 databases (Medline, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Complete, CDSR, CENTRAL, EPISTEMONIKOS, Web of Science Core Collection, Assia, Google Scholar). Ninety-one papers included following reverse chronology quota record screening (from: database searches (n = 56), consortium experts (n = 35)). Included papers: quantitative (n = 40), qualitative (n = 17), mixed-methods (n = 2), evidence syntheses (n = 16), commentaries (n = 9), case reports (n = 7). Exclusion criteria: persons <18 years, non-English language, not focused on SDM or deprescribing in palliative care. An analytic appraisal journal was used with realist logic to synthesize insights from included papers (contents from 43/91 included in this paper). The concept of 'prescribing inertia' was used to formulate explanatory theories about clinician reluctance to deprescribe and the mechanisms underpinning SDM, including (a) the meaning medications have to end-of-life patients (e.g., 'life preserving' or 'symptom management') and public awareness of medications (e.g., high-profile chemotherapy versus low-profile ATT) are determinants of: (i) clinician motivation to engage patients around deprescribing, (ii) patient understanding, volition and participation in SDM; (b) SDM for ATT deprescribing requires sensitive engagement with patients and families without removing positivity around survival and continuing clinician interest in their welfare; (c) multi-disciplinary clinical decision-making about timing and suitability of deprescribing in end-of-life care requires specialized consensus-driven processes and evidence-based decision support tools; (d) if patients are healthy enough, empowerment interventions outside clinical encounters (e.g., health literacy apps) may increase patient and family readiness to engage in deprescribing conversations; (e) organizational investments can facilitate discussion of deprescribing (e.g., improved electronic medical record prompts, clinician communication skills training, data presentation to clinicians of actual ATT risks). Limitations: despite robust screening and selection, the sample of included papers does not reflect the entirety of eligible source material and did not include a systematic search for papers focusing on low- and middle-income country countries. Implementation of ATT deprescribing is enabled or constrained by (a) the meaning of medications to patients; (b) clinician engagement and understanding; (c) multi-disciplinary clinical decision-making processes (including support tools); (d) patient empowerment; (e) organizational investment. Addressing these multi-level factors, including the development of SDM tools, can address the prescribing inertia that may cause devastating impacts on patients and their families as well as moral distress amongst healthcare staff.

We performed an integrated pan-cancer analysis of HuR using public datasets. This encompassed expression profiling, survival analysis, diagnostic accuracy assessment, immune microenvironment characterization, and drug sensitivity prediction. We investigated HuR's regulatory mechanisms through pathway correlation and differential gene expression analyses. HuR expression was consistently elevated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor patient prognosis. It demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (>85%) via TMB/PD-L1 biomarkers. High HuR expression was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and reduced efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, establishing it as a key immunoregulatory biomarker. HuR also predicted sensitivity to cell cycle inhibitors and other pathway-targeted drugs. Mechanistically, HuR drives malignancy by dysregulating core processes: cell cycle progression, immune evasion, and cellular metabolism. Our pan-cancer analysis establishes HuR as a consistently upregulated oncogenic driver across malignancies, functioning as a potential universal biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis. Its critical roles in modulating the immune response and predicting therapeutic sensitivity highlight its importance for personalized cancer treatment strategies.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US Veterans comparing those who tested positive for COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19 between March 15, 2020, and Nov 30, 2020, to those who tested negative. We used data from the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource and Cox proportional hazard regression models to determine the hazard ratio of a new cancer diagnosis within a three-year follow-up period for the COVID-19 positive patients compared to those who were negative. Covariates included age, race, ethnicity, sex, BMI, smoking, being an active patient in the VHA system within a year of the COVID-19 test, and other factors. 499,396 patients were included in this study, with 88590 (17.2%) COVID-19 positive, 427566 (82.8%) COVID-19 negative. The ages of the COVID-19 positive and negative patients were 57.9 ± 16.4 and 59.5 ± 15.8, respectively. For those who survived for at least 30 days after COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 infection was associated with a 25% reduction in the hazard of cancer (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.73-0.77). The reduction of the hazard was similar across sexes and races, except in Asians. Above 45 years of age, the hazard of cancer incidence further decreased with advancing age. Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic had a decreased risk of cancer incidence in a 3-year follow-up across gender and race. Further multicenter prospective cohort studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism of this interaction.",

    "title": "Mutual reinforcement of lymphotoxin-driven myositis and impaired autophagy in murine muscle.",
    "abstract": "Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive muscle disorder characterized by inflammation and degeneration with altered proteostasis. To better understand the interrelationship between these two features, we aimed at establishing a novel preclinical mouse model. First, we used quantitative PCR to determine expression of pro-inflammatory chemo- and cytokines including lymphotoxin (LT)-signaling pathway components in human skeletal muscle tissue diagnosed with myositis. Based on these results we generated a mouse model that we analyzed at the histological, ultrastructural, transcriptional, biochemical, and behavioral level. Lastly, we subjected this model to anti-inflammatory treatments. After confirming and extending previous data on activation of lymphotoxin (LT)-signaling in human myositis, we generated distinct transgenic mouse lines co-expressing LTα and -β in skeletal muscle fibers. Transgenic mice displayed chronic myositis accompanied by dysregulated proteostasis, including an altered autophagolysosomal pathway that initially shows signs of activation and later exhaustion and decreased flux. To enhance the latter, we genetically impaired autophagy in skeletal muscle cells. Autophagy impairment alone induced a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state, but no obvious cellular inflammation. However, the combination of LT-driven myositis with autophagy impairment induced the full spectrum of characteristic molecular and pathological features of IBM in skeletal muscle, including protein inclusions with typical ultrastructural morphology and mild mitochondrial pathology. Our attempts to treat the pathology by subjecting these mice to corticosteroids or anti-Thy1.2 antibodies mirrored recent treatment failures in humans, i.e., none of these treatments resulted in significant clinical improvement of motor performance or the transcriptional profile of muscle pathology. In summary, these data provide evidence that inflammation and autophagy disruption play a synergistic role in the development of IBM-like muscular pathology. Furthermore, once established, IBM-like pathology in these mice, as in human IBM patients cannot be reverted or prevented from progression by conventional means of immunosuppression. We expect that this novel mouse model will help to identify future treatment modalities for IBM.",

    "abstract": "Milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs) are emerging as important mediators in gut pathology and cancer management. These stable nanoscale vesicles contain bioactive cargos including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that facilitate intercellular communication and offer therapeutic opportunities. This review examines mEVs' role in gut health and cancer therapy, synthesizing recent evidence from 2021 to 2025 across various milk sources (camel, bovine, equine, ovine, human). mEVs significantly enhance intestinal health by strengthening epithelial barriers, modulating immune responses, and improving gut microbiota composition. In colitis models, they reduce inflammation, improve intestinal integrity, and restore microbial balance. Additionally, mEVs show promising cancer treatment applications, functioning as natural anticancer agents and efficient drug delivery vehicles. Their biocompatibility, tumor-targeting capabilities, and ability to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicity address key limitations of conventional therapies. mEVs represent a promising frontier in preventive and therapeutic interventions for gastrointestinal disorders and cancer, positioning them as valuable candidates for future clinical applications in food-based therapeutics and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral activation (BA) is recognized as an evidence-based therapy for depression and other mental health conditions. Using meta-analysis and systematic literature review to analyze the research trends is helpful, but it has limitations in understanding the flow and development of BA research. This study aims to analyze BA research trends using keyword network analysis. The study examined network characteristics, centrality, and cohesion by conducting Keyword network analysis (KNA) on BA -related studies from 2003 to 2023. The research was divided into two periods: 2003-2012 and 2013-2023. The analysis revealed an increase in the number of keywords from 26 in the first period to in the second, along with a rise in average degree and keyword links. Notably, cancer research surged during the second period. In terms of centrality, the maximum value rose in the second period, with \"Depression\" maintaining the highest centrality in both periods. For eigenvector centrality, \"Older adult\" ranked highest in the first period, while \"Psycho-oncology\" took the lead in the second. Cohesion analysis showed that in the first period, \"Depression\" was linked to older adult inpatient care, dealing with issues like \"Complicated bereavement,\" \"Posttraumatic stress disorder,\" and \"Cancer,\" as well as serving as a bridge for depression and smoking cessation. In the second period, the scope of \"Depression\" expanded to include older adult, university students, and children, with a focus on emotional variables, social support, and non-face-to-face interventions. This study sheds light on the evolving landscape of research on BA therapy, highlighting its continuous expansion in addressing depression across diverse populations and settings. Our study is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of the research keywords over the past two decades, offering a knowledge map and flow. This contributes to facilitating practical application in clinical settings and understanding research trends related to BA therapy.",

    "abstract": "Central adiposity and poor cardiorespiratory fitness are modifiable risk factors for various diseases. This study investigated their impact on CD4+ differentiated T regulatory (Treg) cell responses. Thirty-eight young adults were classified into high cardiorespiratory fitness/low visceral adipose tissue (High V̇O2-Low VAT, n = 20) and low cardiorespiratory fitness/high VAT (Low V̇O2-High VAT, n = 18). Body composition was assessed using DXA and ultrasound, while cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity were measured via treadmill testing and accelerometry. CD4+ cells were cultured in Treg differentiation medium with 2 ng/mL TGF-β, with or without 100 nM rapamycin or 50 nM Torin-1, for 96 h. Differentiated Treg from Low V̇O2-High VAT participants exhibited no significant changes in IL-10 or IL-6 production with rapamycin or Torin-1. Conversely, differentiated Treg from High V̇O2-Low VAT participants showed significantly lower IL-10 production with rapamycin (p < 0.001, adjusted p < 0.001) and Torin-1 (p < 0.001, adjusted p < 0.001). These findings indicate that low cardiorespiratory fitness and high VAT contribute to an altered inflammatory response, influencing peripheral blood mononuclear cell immunophenotypes and exhaustion markers. Furthermore, mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition modulate cytokine production, emphasizing the role of metabolic status in immune regulation.",

    "title": "Role of CD5 signalling for pro-inflammatory Th17 response in multiple sclerosis.",
    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells are of vital importance in human autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to differentiation and functional plasticity, Th17 cells are able to produce a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17A, interferon (IFN)-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and modulation of Th17 cell activities represents a desirable tool for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we aimed at understanding the role of the surface molecule CD5 and its intracellular interaction partner casein kinase 2 (CK2) in human Th17 effector function as well as their role in MS. We performed targeted single-cell RNA sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from people with MS (pwMS) and non-inflammatory neurological diseases, and high-sensitivity proteomic analysis of serum and CSF from 114 pwMS by using a proximity extension assay (PEA) together with functional investigations on CD4+ memory T cells differentiated into a Th17-polarised phenotype. Blockade of CD5 reduced production of IL-17A, IFN-γ and GM-CSF by Th17-polarised cells without affecting proliferation. In comparison, blockade of its intracellular interaction partner CK2 exerted partly similar effects with a decrease in IL-17A and GM-CSF production but also impaired T cell proliferation. Both blocking agents resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of the downstream signalling molecule STAT3. The CD5 targeting treatment was able to abolish cytotoxic effects caused by Th17-polarised cells. Importantly, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis showed that CD5 expression correlates with an inflammatory immune profile in MS in serum as well as CSF. Our study highlights the importance of the CD5-CK2-STAT3 signalling axis for inflammatory responses of human Th17-polarised cells. Since in humans CD5 expression correlates with inflammation and cellular injury, targeting the CD5 signalling pathway provides future therapeutic opportunities for - among other diseases - MS.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for millions of deaths annually. Its major subtypes-lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), lung adenocarcinoma, and small-cell LC-exhibit distinct risk factors and genetic susceptibilities, necessitating the use of subtype-specific biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted using protein quantitative trait loci from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and deCODE datasets. A robust analytical framework, including reverse MR, meta-analysis, summary-data-based MR tests, and colocalization, cisMR-cML, MR.CUE and phenotype scanning analyses were used to identify proteins associated with LC risk. We conducted a systematic review to contextualize our research findings. Follow-up analyses, including pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction network analysis, and druggability evaluations, were used to explore the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the identified proteins. Significant proteins were validated using population-level proteomic data from the UK Biobank (UKB). The results showed that twenty-five proteins were significantly associated with LC or its subtypes, including 15 novel findings. 60S ribosomal protein L14 (RPL14) and advanced glycosylation end-product-specific receptor (AGER) emerged as the strongest discovery, demonstrating consistent and significant associations across both MR and population-level analyses. RPL14 exhibited positive associations with overall LC risk (MR_meta: odds ratio [OR]: 2.012, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.297-3.119; UKB: OR: 1.509, 95% CI: 1.015-2.244). Similarly, AGER showed significant protective effects against LUSC risk (MR_meta: OR: 0.572, 95%CI: 0.368-0.889; UKB: OR: 0.366, 95% CI: 0.158-0.850). Pathway analysis revealed the involvement of these proteins in immune regulation and tumorigenesis. Among the 13 identified druggable targets, RPL14 and AGER showed therapeutic potential as approved or investigational drugs targeting these proteins. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenesis of LC and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases are an increasing threat to human health and well-being in the United States. Understanding public perception and practices to reduce vector abundance and vector-human contact can guide effective interventions. Nevertheless, vector-borne disease surveys, which are widely used in the field to understand public perception and practices, are often inconsistent in terms of structure and implementation. This protocol is designed to provide guidance for public health professionals and researchers in the development of future knowledge, attitudes, and practices studies by ensuring uniformity in design and structure. This manuscript describes a rigorous three-phase protocol for the development of standardized vector-borne disease survey modules that can be used throughout the United States to generate data that are comparable across diverse regions. During phase one, a workshop with subject matter experts and a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify survey domains and generate items of interest. Survey items will also be mapped based on two theoretical frameworks: the Health Belief Model and the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-Regulation framework. Standards across knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys will enhance the analysis and interpretation of the data across geographies and time. During phase two, a group of expert judges will evaluate survey items based on content relevance, representativeness, and technical quality. During the final phase, cognitive interviews and surveys with target audience groups will be conducted to measure and ensure the face validity, reliability, and external validity of the modules. Participants will be drawn from a diverse range of educational backgrounds and geographic locations. The surveys developed through this protocol will facilitate acquisition of insights into the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning vector-borne diseases, allowing for the collection of comparable data across various regions in the United States.",

Evidence supported guidelines for treatment timeliness exist in many cancers, but not for multiple myeloma (MM) though there is reason to believe delays in treatment would be detrimental. This scoping review aims to explore what is known about the impacts of the time from diagnosis to treatment among patients with MM. Our review will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. Our search strategy was developed to identify sources published in or after the year 2000 related to time to treatment for adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Embase. Sources will be screened by two independent reviewers after exclusion/inclusion criteria are pilot tested and refined. A data extraction form was developed and will be refined by the study team for use during the scoping review. This review will summarize the landscape of research related to time to treatment among newly diagnosed adults with multiple myeloma. Raising awareness of the available evidence on this topic, within the MM clinical and research community, will guide future research to address identified knowledge gaps.

    "abstract": "Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of EGFR-sensitive-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the metabolic mechanisms driving third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. We conducted plasma metabolomics analysis on 216 longitudinal samples from 186 NSCLC patients enrolled in the clinical trial of rezivertinib (NCT03386955). Additionally, multi-omics profiling of rezivertinib-resistant cell lines, functional in vitro experiments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of 215 NSCLC patients were integrated to reveal underlying mechanisms. Non-responder patients exhibited elevated glycerophospholipids and dysregulated lysophospholipid (LPL) metabolism. Unsupervised clustering identified two patient subgroups, with Cluster 1 (characterized by high LPL levels) associated with poorer survival (P = 0.022). Metabolite-based predictive model achieved robust performance (AUC: 0.7762 [training], 0.7485 [test]). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated LPLs and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) accumulation during the resistance process. Integrated multi-omics analyses highlighted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glycerophospholipid reprogramming in rezivertinib-resistant cells. Functional assays confirmed that LPA promoted cell migration and invasion, and attenuated the efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKI, while disruption of the LPA-LPAR signaling axis reversed LPA-mediated resistance. scRNA-seq identified an LPA-secreting malignant subset (cluster c4), characterized by enhanced EMT activation and extensive microenvironmental crosstalk through Wnt, TGF-β, and ECM signals. Our study highlights the pivotal role of LPA-mediated signaling and metabolic reprogramming in third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. Targeting LPA production or its downstream pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.

However, outcomes are poor for multiply relapsed/refractory tumors. We studied gemcitabine/docetaxel/melphalan/carboplatin (GemDMC), which exploits DNA damage repair inhibition. We hypothesized that concurrent bevacizumab, targeting the high vascularity of GCT, would synergize with HDC. Trial eligibility included 2nd or later relapse or poor-risk 1st relapse, and adequate end-organ function. Treatment consisted of sequential bevacizumab-GemDMC (HDC cycle 1, C1) and bevacizumab-ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) (C2), in 3 consecutive cohorts: bevacizumab/full-dose GemDMC (cohort 1), bevacizumab/reduced-dose GemDMC (cohort 2), and no bevacizumab/reduced-dose GemDMC (cohort 3). The trial was powered to distinguish a target 50% 2-year RFS rate from an expected <25%. We validated its results in an off-trial 4th cohort treated the same as cohort 3. We treated 165 male patients (65 trial, 100 cohort 4), after a median of 3 prior therapy lines; mostly cisplatin-refractory tumors at relapse (45% refractory, 23% absolutely refractory); 19% primary mediastinal tumors. Overall response rate: 84.5% (77% CR/PRm-). The treatment-related mortality rates in cohorts 1 to 4 were 13%, 8%, 4%, and 4%, respectively.

We asked whether near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tumor-associated inflammation could identify high-risk premalignant lesions, leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a sentinel of local disease and, thus, enhance surgery outcomes. Fluorescence-guided surgery was performed on genetically engineered mice (Ptf1a-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+; Smad4flox/flox [KSC]) at discrete stages of disease progression, histologically confirmed high-risk, premalignant lesions in postnatal mice to locally advanced pancreatic tumors in adults, using the imaging agent V-1520, a translocator protein (TSPO) ligand. Age-matched wild-type littermates were used as controls, while Ptf1a-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+(KC) mice modeled pancreatitis and precursors of low penetrance. Localization of V-1520 and tumor-associated macrophages amongst the TME was detected by immunofluorescence imaging. V-1520 exhibited robust accumulation in the pancreata of KSC mice from the early postnatal stage. Increased accumulation was observed in the pancreata of adolescent- and adult-aged mice with greater ductal lesion and stromal burden. Confocal microscopy of ex vivo pancreas specimens co-localized V-1520 accumulation primarily with CD68-expressing macrophage in KSC mice. Unlike the pancreata of KSC mice, accumulation of V-1520 did not exceed background levels in the pancreata of KC mice with pancreatitis. V-1520 exhibited differential accumulation in pancreatic cancer-associated inflammation compared to pancreatitis. Given the robust tracer uptake in tissues associated with early yet high-risk lesions, we envision V-1520 could enhance surgical resection and reduce the potential for recurrence from residual disease.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family, shares high homology with both UCP1 and UCP2. Its exact functional role has been elusive since its discovery, with previous studies primarily focusing on studying UCP3 function in differentiated skeletal muscle myotubes or whole animal models because basal levels of UCP3 protein are low in undifferentiated myoblasts. In the present study, we demonstrate that UCP3 plays a role in modulating energy and redox stress related pathways in undifferentiated muscle myoblasts. Although low, UCP3 mRNA and protein levels were detectable in WT myoblasts. Both whole-body UCP3 knockout (wKO) and conditional UCP3 knockout (cKO) myoblasts displayed increased activation of AMPK (pAMPK) and elevated levels of PPARδ/β and GLUT4 proteins compared to wild type (WT) myoblasts. This altered energy signaling was further associated with UCP3 KO myoblasts exhibiting impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, while WT cells and UCP3 KO cells expressing WT UCP3 were sensitive to insulin stimulation. Moroever, UCP3 KO myoblasts had an accumulation of fatty acids and upregulation of downstream PPARδ target genes in UCP3 KO cells. Lastly, UCP3 KO myoblasts were found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress and hypoxia, due in part to a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio compared to WT myoblasts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that UCP3 is a key modulator of energy sensing and oxidative stress in undifferentiated skeletal muscle myoblasts.",

We used a multimodal approach combining clinical data, AI-based analysis of H&E-stained whole-slide images of melanoma before ICI start, and gene expression signatures to identify biomarkers for relapse after discontinuing ICI in the absence of treatment progression. Univariable Cox regression analysis identified best overall response, mRNA expression of six genes, tumor cell density (TCD), and the lymphocyte to plasma cell ratio (LYM/PC) as factors predictive of relapse upon cessation of ICI. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that both TGFBR1 expression and the integral digital pathology parameter-based prognostic system were independently associated with relapse after ICI discontinuation. Training a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) model achieved the highest overall predictive accuracy of 84.6% for relapse after ICI discontinuation. The identified prognostic markers are fully explainable and easily implementable in routine practice and facilitate risk stratification upon cessation of ICI therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Primary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PHNENs), including primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PHNEC), are extremely rare. PHNENs typically exhibit slow growth, although mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms have poor prognoses. PHNENs are also challenging to diagnose. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old man underwent plain computed tomography (CT), which incidentally detected a 42-mm solitary hepatic tumor. Serum levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were elevated at 138 mAU/mL. Thirteen days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enlarged hepatic tumor with tumor thromboses extending into the hepatic and portal veins. No early-phase enhancement was observed. At 18 days, Doppler ultrasound and dynamic CT evaluated the tumor as hypovascular, and a newly swollen solitary lymph node appeared. At 39 days, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT revealed strong uptake in the primary liver tumor and metastatic lymph nodes, with additional distant lymph node metastases emerging. At 49 days, a metastatic cervical lymph node was surgically resected. At 61 days, PHNEC was definitively diagnosed based on histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments. The Ki-67 labeling index was >90%. At 67 days, he was hospitalized to begin chemotherapy, but CT revealed end-stage disease. Palliative treatment was required, and the patient died of cancer 82 days after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a thought-provoking case of PHNEC with rapid oncological progression. To clarify clinical implications (eg, atypical imaging features and diagnostic pitfalls), detailed imaging findings are provided. We anticipate that this case will be informative for clinicians in this field.",

Then, we describe how to use genetic engineering techniques, such as lentiviral or retroviral gene overexpression, as well as CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion, to modify these lines and transform them into pre-cancerous tumoroids. We also report how to use them for in vitro validation, via the extraction of genetic materials and immunofluorescence staining. Finally, we indicate how to effectively inject these tumoroids in the ovarian bursa, the autochthonous site of HGSOC, for tumor initiation.",

Baseline and longitudinal measurable residual disease (MRD) negative status is a well-established positive predictive sign in lenalidomide maintenance patients. However, the clinical utility of serial MRD assessments remains uncertain, as there is no consensus on the clinical management of MRD-resurgence (MRDres) or stable remissions in patients positive for MRD. Here we report the complete and final results of a phase 2, single-arm study of 5 years of continuous lenalidomide maintenance in MM patients following unrestricted upfront therapy, along with exploratory peripheral blood T cell profiling experiments performed via high-dimensional spectral cytometry. Patients with MRDres had inferior PFS to those with sustained MRD-negativity at the 1- and 2-year landmarks (P=0.036, P=0.0014 respectively); however, myeloma progression only occurred within 2 years of MRDres in 36% of patients, with no progression observed in the remaining 64% of patients at last follow-up. Exploratory peripheral blood T cell profiling experiments throughout the trial period identified an immune signature of early relapse in patient cohorts both negative and positive for MRD at the start of maintenance therapy. T cell profiles enriched with activated cytotoxic effectors predicted early relapse while quiescent T cell profiles enriched with naïve T cell populations predicted durable remissions. This \"immune-MRD\" status showed predictive potential, and segregated patients with MRDres and early disease progression from patients with sustained remission despite MRDres.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are biomarkers associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This analysis evaluates the prognostic role of baseline CTC enumeration and its interaction with treatment regimens in patients progressing on CDK4/6 inhibitors. The PACE trial is a phase II, multicenter, randomized study of HR+/HER2- MBC patients experiencing progression on aromatase inhibitors (AI) and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Patients were randomized 1:2:1 to receive fulvestrant (F), F+palbociclib (F+P), or F+P+avelumab (F+P+A). Baseline CTCs were enumerated using CellSearch™ with a threshold of ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL to classify patients as StageIV indolent or StageIV aggressive. Concurrent ctDNA analysis was performed using Guardant360®. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Among 220 randomized patients, 203 were evaluable for baseline CTCs; 76% had detectable CTCs, and 49% were StageIV aggressive. Patients with de novo MBC were more frequently StageIV aggressive (47.5% vs. 30.8%). Baseline CTCs were prognostic, with median PFS of 5.7 months for StageIV indolent and 3.5 months for StageIV aggressive patients (HR 1.69, 90% CI 1.27-2.24, P<0.001). In StageIV aggressive patients, F+P and F+P+A improved PFS versus F alone (HR 0.43, 90% CI 0.25-0.71 and HR 0.26, 90% CI 0.14-0.49, respectively). No benefit was observed in StageIV indolent patients (interaction p=0.0148 and p=0.0033, respectively). Baseline CTC enumeration provides significant prognostic information in HR+/HER2- MBC. StageIV aggressive patients derive greater benefit from F+P or F+P+A over F alone, independent of clinical or ctDNA features. This highlights the potential of to guide treatment decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The United States Food and Drug Administration approved human papillomavirus (HPV) self-collection in a healthcare setting as a cervical cancer screening approach in May 2024. It is therefore important to examine women's acceptability of this approach. We conducted an online survey in September 2024 with a national sample of women ages 45-65 from the United States (n = 296). Logistic regression identified correlates of participants' willingness to use HPV self-collection in a healthcare setting. Overall, 64.4 percent of participants were willing to use HPV self-collection in a healthcare setting if it was free or covered by insurance, while 23.9 percent were willing if it cost $150 out of pocket. Participants were more willing to use HPV self-collection for free if they had some form of health insurance (odds ratio [OR] = 3.49, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-9.71), had a routine medical checkup within the last year (OR = 3.50, 95 percent CI: 1.42-8.62), or reported a higher perceived likelihood of cervical cancer (OR = 1.93, 95 percent CI: 1.18-3.17). In summary, most women are willing to use HPV self-collection in a healthcare setting if it is free or covered by health insurance. Our findings can guide future programs that include HPV self-collection in a healthcare setting to increase cervical cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing is a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. With Food and Drug Administration approval for poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in patients with metastatic breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, there is an additional therapeutic rationale for testing all patients with these cancers for germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. However, many at-risk patients do not have access to genetic services, leaving many genetic carriers unidentified. The eREACH (A Randomized Study of an eHealth Delivery Alternative for Cancer Genetic Testing for Hereditary Predisposition in Metastatic Breast, Ovarian, Prostate, and Pancreatic Cancer Patients) study evaluates the effectiveness of a theoretically and stakeholder-informed eHealth (eg, digital) delivery alternative to traditional genetic counseling for patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer or advanced or metastatic ovarian or pancreatic cancer referred for genetic testing to determine whether they are candidates for a PARP inhibitor. The eREACH study is a randomized noninferiority study using a 2 × 2 design to test a self-directed digital intervention to deliver clinical genetic testing for patients with metastatic cancers. The traditional standard-of-care pretest (visit 1) and posttest (visit 2-disclosure) counseling delivered by a genetic counselor is replaced with our patient-informed digital intervention. The four arms were as follows: arm A, genetic counselor for visits 1 and 2; arm B, genetic counselor for visit 1 and digital intervention for visit 2; arm C, digital intervention for visit 1 and genetic counselor for visit 2; and arm D, digital intervention for both visits. Participants were adults with advanced or metastatic breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The primary outcomes of this study were change in genetic knowledge and anxiety from baseline to postdisclosure assessment. We will test whether the digital intervention is noninferior to standard-of-care counseling with a genetic counselor using a modified noninferiority ANOVA of the posttest disclosure minus baseline change scores. In secondary analyses, we will test pairwise differences among the 4 groups. As of January 2025, we have completed enrollment of 229 participants. Data analysis is ongoing, and we expect the results to be published in 2025. Increasing indications for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing create a pressing need to evaluate alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of these tests while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. The eREACH study evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive, patient-centered digital intervention to deliver clinical genetic testing to patients with metastatic cancers. We expect that this work will inform evidence-based guidelines and the standard of care for delivery of genetic testing, and it is designed to be broadly applicable and easily adaptable for other populations and settings even beyond oncology.

    "abstract": "Rectal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality, requiring accurate diagnosis via MRI scans. However, detecting rectal cancer in MRI scans is challenging due to image complexity and the need for precise localization. While transformer-based object detection has excelled in natural images, applying these models to medical data is hindered by limited medical imaging resources. To address this, we propose the Spatially Prioritized Detection Transformer (SP DETR), which incorporates a Spatially Prioritized (SP) Decoder to constrain anchor boxes to regions of interest (ROI) based on anatomical maps, focusing the model on areas most likely to contain cancer. Additionally, the SP cross-attention mechanism refines the learning of anchor box offsets. To improve small cancer detection, we introduce the Global Context-Guided Feature Fusion Module (GCGFF), leveraging a transformer encoder for global context and a Globally-Guided Semantic Fusion Block (GGSF) to enhance high-level semantic features. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves detection accuracy, especially for small rectal cancers, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating anatomical priors with transformer-based models for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most prevalent form of pancreatic tumor, is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been recently identified as a promising target in multiple human and mouse PDAC preclinical tumor models, due to significant downregulation of gene transcription and preferential inhibition of the mitotic cell cycle. With the aim of finding new CDK7 inhibitors, new indolyl and 7-aza-indolyl pyrazolo [1,5-a]-1,3,5-triazine derivatives are efficiently synthesized and screened for antiproliferative activity against three immortalized cell lines (SUIT 2.28, PATU-T, PANC-1) of PDAC. 8 out of 33 derivatives show remarkable cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.19 to 1.58 µM and remarkable inhibition of cell migration from the earliest time point of 4 h, persisting until 24 h. The two most active compounds are further evaluated in clinically relevant models,including gemcitabine-resistant and primary cells (PATU-T GR, PDAC3), confirming their potent activity. They induce apoptosis, upregulate apoptotic gene expression, and disrupt the cell cycle, significantly reducing the viability of spheroidal PATU-T cultures. Additionally, both compounds effectively inhibit CDK7, as demonstrated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell extracts and by a specific enzymatic activity assay.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 25 years, a growing body of literature has shown oncology family caregivers experience as much, if not more, stress than the oncology patient. This research has demonstrated the need to establish programs to support these family caregivers. To establish a proactive oncology family caregiver support process to assist family caregivers during the cancer patient's treatment regimen. Based on the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice, an evidence-based practice process was established in a large, downtown hospital's oncology infusion center designed to assess the distress and burden level of the family caregivers. Using the Caregiver Quality of Life Index - Cancer questionnaire, family caregivers were assessed for their overall sense of well-being. In the initial pilot process, family caregivers of patients with GI or lung cancer were asked if they wished to participate as they represented two of the largest disease group populations for this oncology clinic. Eighty-three family caregivers (44%) agreed. The sixty-six family caregivers who reported an increased level of distress were referred to the oncology medical social worker to assist with interventions as indicated by their responses. The efficacy of this proactive approach of assessing family caregiver distress resulted in the implementation of 95 baseline interventions for the 66 participants. The follow-up assessments resulted in 25 interventions, a 26% decrease. Family caregivers reported a 13% increase in their reported quality of life at the time of their third evaluation with the lowest scores improving by 50%. The need for ongoing support services for oncology family caregivers to help them thrive through the cancer journey was validated. In response to this need, as of September 2024, this process became a permanent feature of the hospital's oncology infusion center services which now supports family caregivers of patients in all oncology disease groups.",

This article reviews the clinical efficacy of Vacuum-Assisted Biopsy (VAB) and Vacuum-Assisted Excision (VAE) and calculates the potential Canadian direct cost savings by implementing VAE for the management of benign and high-risk breast lesions in place of Surgical Diagnostic Excision (SDE): calculated to be $1,607,769 to $11,341,107 (2025 CAD) annually in Canada, or $2,208 (2025 CAD) per-patient procedural savings from avoiding SDEs. Additional non-quantifiable patient benefits are also explored: avoiding unnecessary surgery; preventing the associated anxiety and time off work; and greater patient autonomy over their diagnosis journey, helping maintain their quality of life. Finally, barriers to adoption are identified, and an Implementation Leadership Action Plan is proposed, to help support the successful integration of this practice shift. The plan includes procedural reimbursement and policy changes, and multidisciplinary engagement targeting radiology, surgery, and pathology stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Cancer screening is a critical tool in cancer control, reducing cancer-specific mortality. However, it also has potential harms, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Measuring the effect of screening based on all-cause mortality is insensitive to both benefits and harms and requires substantially large sample sizes. Understanding the impact of screening on noncancer-related (off-target) mortality is essential for evaluating its overall benefit. To assess the association between cancer screening and off-target mortality by comparing mortality rates between screened and unscreened populations based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The analysis examined all RCTs included in a previously published (August 28, 2023) meta-analysis of cancer screening trials that included the end point of all-cause mortality in addition to targeted cancer mortality. All RCTs included in the previous meta-analysis were included. The latest search in that meta analysis was conducted on October 12, 2022, with no language or publication date restrictions. The study followed relevant portions of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Two authors independently extracted data, and a third author verified those data. Off-target mortality was analyzed using rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs via a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary outcome was off-target mortality, defined as deaths with a cause that was not the targeted cancer. A total of 17 RCTs (8 of colorectal, 3 prostate, 3 lung, 2 breast, and 1 multiple cancers) including 1 305 924 participants with 18 508 192 person-years of follow-up were included. Screening did not significantly increase off-target mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01); the overall increase in off-target mortality was 0.2% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.9%). There was no evidence of heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 0.00%; Cochran Q = 14.96, df = 18; P = .66). The trial-specific RRs ranged from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.69-1.15) to 1.09 (95% CI, 0.98-1.22), with all 95% CIs including 1. Targeted cancer deaths accounted for 2.6% to 33.1% of all deaths, depending on the cancer type. These findings show that randomization to cancer screening was not associated with more than a very small increase in noncancer-related mortality, with the 95% CI excluding an increase of greater than 1%. The findings emphasize the importance of evaluating targeted and off-target mortality separately rather than relying solely on all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of breast and gynecologic cancers may hamper employment; little is known about who is at greater risk of resignation. To examine whether a breast or gynecologic cancer diagnosis is associated with resignation in working women and to identify high-risk subpopulations. This matched cohort study included women aged 15 to 58 years insured by the Japan Health Insurance Association. From April 2017 to March 2023, women newly diagnosed with breast, cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer were identified and matched in a 1:10 ratio to working women without these cancers. Cancer diagnosis was based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The primary outcome was all-cause resignation, and the secondary outcome was a composite of resignation and death, both assessed during a 2-year follow-up. Stratified Cox proportional-hazards models were applied, with multiple imputation and covariate adjustments. Subgroup analyses by prespecified covariates assessed effect size moderation and interactions between exposure and these covariates. The study included 99 964 women with cancer, including 59 452 women with breast cancer (median [IQR] age, 48 [44-53] years), 14 713 women with cervical cancer (median [IQR] age, 46 [39-51] years), 16 933 women with uterine cancer (median [IQR] age, 49 [44-53 years]), and 8866 women with ovarian cancer (median age [IQR] age, 47 [40-52] years), as well as 999 640 matched controls (594 520 for the breast cancer cohort, 147 130 for the cervical cancer cohort, 169 330 for the uterine cancer cohort, and 88 660 for the ovarian cancer cohort). Most women with cancer were working in the medical, health care, or welfare sector (32 123 women [32.1%]). During follow-up, resignation rates were significantly higher for women with cancer vs controls (breast cancer: 10 820 women [18.2%] vs 97 892 women [16.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16-1.20; cervical cancer: 3296 women [22.4%] vs 27 476 women [18.7%]; HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.26-1.36; uterine cancer: 3161 women [18.7%] vs 27 786 women [16.4%]; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; ovarian cancer: 2004 women [22.6%] vs 15 847 women [17.9%]; HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.37-1.51). Regarding the composite outcome of resignation and death, there was an increased risk for all cohorts, ranging from an HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.22-1.27) for breast cancer to 1.81 (95% CI, 1.73-1.89) for ovarian cancer. Among all 4 cancer cohorts, resignation risk was higher among women with older age, lower income, and a history of depression. In this cohort study using a nationwide health claims database in Japan, breast and gynecologic cancers were associated with a higher resignation risk, especially among those with older age, lower income, and depression history. These findings suggest that developing targeted support interventions may benefit women at high resignation risk after a cancer diagnosis.",

However, language barriers are common in case with less spoken languages, making communication challenging. We aimed to design and validate a set of illustrations addressing these key topics.MethodsThe design of the pictures was led by three pharmacists, focusing on three topics: general information (medication history), problems detection (AE of anticancer treatments, HDI) and the proper use of supportive care (e.g., mouthwash). Illustrations were created using Canva® (Canva Pty Ltd, Perth, Australia). Each card underwent a two-step validation process: an on-site evaluation (Wooclap® (Bruxelles, Belgium) for agreement/disagreement with recommendations), followed by a broader validation involving a multidisciplinary panel including oncologists, general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and patients- using a 9-point Likert scale on a Google® Form (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA).ResultsA total of 53 cards were initially evaluated by 19 pharmacists who fully approved 18 of them and provided recommendations for the others.

    "abstract": "The lower all-cause mortality in women with Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared with the general population has been hypothesized to be due to a \"healthy-user effect,\" but this has not been studied in large cohorts. In a population-based, retrospective cohort study comprising 18,942 women with primary DCIS between 1999 and 2015 in the Netherlands, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer death (BCD) was estimated using death by other cause as a competing risk. The cause-specific mortality risk of women with DCIS was compared with that of the Dutch female population. Multivariable competing risk regression was used to quantify the effects of the method of detection and socio-economic status (SES). With 289 BCDs, the 10-year cumulative incidence of BCD was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1-1.5). Compared to the Dutch female population, women with DCIS had a 2.1-times higher risk of BCD, but a 7% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Women with screen-detected DCIS had lower risks of BCD compared to women with non-screen-detected DCIS (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]:0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.77), as did women with high SES versus low SES (sHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.97) in the first 4 years of follow-up, adjusted for age and year at diagnosis, and DCIS characteristics. In conclusion, overall mortality in women with DCIS is not higher compared to the Dutch female population, though death due to invasive breast cancer is increased. Within all women with DCIS, those with screen-detected DCIS or high SES had lower BCD and all-cause mortality, suggesting a healthy-user effect.",

This study aimed to determine whether distinct early post-discharge pain trajectories could be identified in patients with stage IA NSCLC undergoing thoracoscopic sublobar resection. The data were collected from a longitudinal prospective observational cohort (CN-PRO-Lung 3). Pain severity was rated using a 0-10 scale, with assessments conducted before surgery and daily after discharge for up to 30 days. Post-discharge pain trajectories were identified using the latent class mixed model. Potential risk factors associated with different pain trajectory were explored, including preoperative clinical characteristics, body composition metrics derived from chest computed tomography, surgical methods, and postoperative clinical outcomes. A total of 439 patients were selected in the trajectory analysis. One trajectory comprised 65 patients (14.8%, unrecovered group) who experienced persistent moderated post-discharge pain, while the other comprised 374 patients (85.2%, recovered group) with mild post-discharge pain and a declining trend. The independent predictors for the unrecovered post-discharge pain trajectory included the subcutaneous fat index (odds ratio [OR] 1.031, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.055, p = 0.010), preoperative pain severity (OR 1.428, 95% CI 1.102-1.851, p = 0.007), and hospital stay (OR 1.166, 95% CI 1.012-1.345, p = 0.034).

Patients with EBL of 100 ml or less were defined as group 1 (n = 359), and those with EBL exceeding 100 ml were defined as group 2 (n = 166). Perioperative data and postoperative functional and pathologic outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups. The patients in group 2 had longer lymph node dissection time, prostatectomy time, anastomosis time, total operation time, drain removal time, and hospital stay, as well a greater EBL, higher surgical margin ratio, greater positive surgical margin according to pathologic stage, and longer time to reach continence (p = 0.001). No difference was observed between urinary incontinence (UI) scores at the sixth month postoperatively (p = 0.191). A high degree of correlation was observed between EBL and other parameters (drain removal time, hospital length of stay, time to reach continence, prostatectomy time, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire [ICIQ] total score at the first and third months, and total operation and anastomosis time, respectively; rho-factor ≥ 0.5; p < 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, EBL was determined to be a predictive factor for achieving postoperative urinary continence. The study demonstrated that perioperative EBL is associated with postoperative urinary continence and oncologic outcomes after RARP.",

Employing Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace, the study quantifies contributions across countries, institutions, authors, and research foci. Key findings reveal the United States (440 publications) and China (352) as leading producers, with UNICANCER (287 publications) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (61) as top institutions. Keyword clustering identified six research themes: PARPi resistance mechanisms (Cluster 1, red) emerged as the dominant focus, followed by immunotherapy combinations for platinum-resistant disease (Cluster 2, green), maintenance therapy (Cluster 3, blue), BRCA mutations (Cluster 4, yellow), applications beyond ovarian cancer (Cluster 5, purple), and anti-angiogenic mechanisms (Cluster 6, light blue). Temporal analysis highlighted an evolution from foundational research (e.g., DNA repair pathways) toward clinical translation (e.g., maintenance therapy optimization). Notable citation bursts surrounded clinical milestones, including the SOLO1 trial's 7-year overall survival data (burst strength: 23.99), underscoring the field's emphasis on survival outcomes. Critical gaps persist in understanding resistance mechanisms and developing immuno-combination strategies, which constituted only 4.8% of keyword frequency.

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has spurred the exploration of precision therapies based on molecular subtypes, with the androgen receptor (AR)-positive subtype emerging as a potential therapeutic target. The treatment of AR-positive TNBC relies primarily on androgen receptor antagonists, such as enobosarm, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide. To enhance efficacy, researchers are investigating combination therapies that integrate anti-androgen agents with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or PARP inhibitors. Additionally, studies have revealed that the AR signaling pathway regulates the tumor microenvironment, and AR inhibition may potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, anti-AR therapies face significant limitations and challenges due to multifaceted factors, necessitating further resolution. With continued advancements, AR-targeted therapy holds promise as a critical component of personalized treatment strategies for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Despite advancements in understanding its molecular mechanisms, effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets remain elusive. This study utilizes a multi-omics approach to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. A multi-omics framework integrating druggable genomics, Mendelian randomization (MR), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed. Druggable genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci data, and therapeutic targets were predicted through MR analysis. These targets were cross-referenced with mesothelioma-specific single-cell markers and validated by summary data-based MR and protein quantitative trait loci analysis. Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to explore functional mechanisms. Drug sensitivity was assessed with the GDSC2 dataset, and potential therapeutic compounds were identified through molecular docking simulations using the Drug Signature Database. Mediated MR analysis investigated 731 immune cells and 1,400 metabolites as mediators of the identified genes' effects on mesothelioma. CYTL1 and H6PD were identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. CYTL1 was associated with poor prognosis and reduced drug sensitivity, while H6PD showed the opposite trend. Although molecular docking results for H6PD were unfavorable, compounds targeting CYTL1 were identified. Immune cells did not mediate the effects of either gene on mesothelioma progression, despite their prognostic associations. Metabolic mediation analysis revealed that CYTL1 influences mesothelioma via levulinoylcarnitine levels, whereas H6PD regulates tumor metabolism through the mannose-to-mannitol-to-sorbitol ratio and glutamate-to-5-oxoproline ratio. This study identifies CYTL1 and H6PD as key regulators of tumor metabolism in mesothelioma. CYTL1 is a promising therapeutic target, warranting further investigation, while H6PD remains a potential candidate despite unfavorable docking results. These findings demonstrate the value of multi-omics approaches in identifying novel therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer, often caused by asbestos exposure, with few treatment options and a poor prognosis. This study aims to find new ways to treat mesothelioma by identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.We used a multi-omics approach, which combines genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, to explore the biology of mesothelioma. By looking at genetic variations, single-cell data, and protein analysis, we identified two important molecules—CYTL1 and H6PD—that play a key role in the cancer’s metabolism.Here’s what we found: CYTL1: This molecule is linked to a poor prognosis in mesothelioma patients. It also makes the cancer cells less responsive to certain drugs, suggesting it could be a potential target for new treatments. H6PD: This molecule seems to help mesothelioma grow by affecting the balance of certain sugars and amino acids in the cells. Despite not showing promising results in drug simulations, H6PD remains a candidate for further study. Our results show how understanding the metabolism of mesothelioma can lead to new treatment strategies. The findings highlight CYTL1 and H6PD as important targets that could guide future drug development for this challenging cancer.",

Linked IQVIA commercial claims and electronic medical record data were used to analyze BRCA test utilization among women aged 18-64 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer or ovarian cancer during 2016-2021, excluding 2018. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing utilization of testing by cancer type, age group, race, and year. Among commercially insured women with newly diagnosed breast cancer (n = 19,139) or epithelial ovarian cancer (n = 1639), 50 and 47%, respectively, received germline BRCA testing during the study years. BRCA testing rates were higher among women with breast cancer aged 18-50 years (69%) compared to those aged 51-64 years (39%). Overall utilization among women with breast or ovarian cancer was slightly lower in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2020. Compared with White women with breast cancer, Asian women were less likely (PR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) to receive testing. Nearly one-third of women who had breast cancer at age 50 or younger and a majority of women with ovarian cancer had no germline BRCA testing recorded within 1 year of diagnosis. Under current (2024) guidelines, these women and their family members are eligible for genetic counseling and testing to guide preventive interventions for future cancers. Healthcare providers have an important role in offering genetic services to women and their families, ensuring that eligible women receive recommended care.",

Leukemia is mainly propelled by LSCs that possess remarkable self-renewal and differentiation abilities, comparable to those of regular HSCs. The presence of LSCs is crucial for the progress and amplification of leukemia, as they enable evasion of the immune system and resilience to therapy. ncRNAs have emerged as a potential means of regulating various forms of cancer, owing to their role in diverse cellular processes. Long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and Circular RNAs are among the most studied ncRNAs and exert control over the expression of numerous proteins related to the advancement of malignancies. Given the importance of LSCs in leukemia and the potential of ncRNAs, we aimed to explore the ncRNAs abnormally expressed in leukemia and investigate them as therapeutic targets. In addition, in our review, we thoroughly examined the ncRNAs responsible for conferring chemo-resistance to LSCs.",

While established prognostic factors include tumor stage and lymph node involvement, the role of HRQOL in survival remains underexplored. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer at a tertiary center between April 2013 and August 2024. Preoperative HRQOL domains-physical (PF), role (RF), and emotional functioning (EF)-were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Patients were stratified based on PF scores (≥ 90 vs. <90), and propensity score matching was applied. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models. Overall, 276 patients were included. Patients with PF scores ≥ 90 had significantly higher 5-year OS (80.4% vs. 55.5%, p = 0.003) and lower recurrence rates. Low PF scores were an independent predictor of worse OS (HR: 2.54, 95% CI 1.42-4.55, p = 0.002). RF scores also influenced OS, while EF scores showed no association with survival. Preoperative PF and RF scores provide valuable prognostic information for patients undergoing RC. Given the modifiable nature of PF, prehabilitation programs could improve outcomes. Integrating HRQOL assessments into routine preoperative evaluations may enhance personalized risk stratification and patient care.",

In such cases, meso-caval shunt (MCS) emerges as a solution. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of permanent MCS as both an emergency procedure and a planned surgical strategy. We retrospectively analyzed 8 consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with permanent MCS between July 2019 and January 2025 at our institution. Clinicopathological characteristics were identified using electronic medical records, and the same surgeon performed all surgeries. The study included seven cases of pancreatic cancer and one ampullary carcinoma (6 male, 2 females; age 54-71 years). The mean operative duration was 510 min with 767 ml blood loss. All patients achieved R0 resection with minor complications (Clavien-Dindo grade I/II), no mortality, and preserved portal perfusion. Meso-caval shunt patency was confirmed postoperatively without hepatic dysfunction. Median survival reached 21 months. Permanent MCS is a reliable elective option for venous reconstruction in pancreaticoduodenectomy, especially when graft-based solutions are not available. Its success in achieving R0 resection while maintaining portal hemodynamics suggests its utility in complex pancreatic resections.",

This retrospective study included consecutive patients who had rectal MRI from January 1, 2010, to March 31, 2021, showing T1-T2 rectal cancer before undergoing total mesorectal excision without neoadjuvant therapy. Visible mesorectal lymph nodes on DWI were segmented by a junior reader, and ADC values were extracted. Additionally, the junior reader and a senior reader independently recorded qualitative T2WI parameters of the most suspicious lymph node per patient. Histopathology was the reference standard for malignant (pN+) and benign (pN-) lymph node status. Of 69 patients (37 men and 32 women) (median age, 55 years; IQR: 48-66), 23 (33%) had pN+ status; 46 (67%) had pN- status.

    "abstract": "Oral cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) being the predominant histological type. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of metabolic reprogramming in oral carcinogenesis, particularly alterations in lipid homeostasis that contribute to disease progression and development. This review synthesizes current knowledge on lipid metabolism dysregulation in oral cancer, focusing on key aspects of metabolic reprogramming mechanisms, serum lipid profile alterations, lipid peroxidation pathways, immunometabolic interactions, and emerging therapeutic strategies. Mechanistically, OSCC exhibits significant alterations in key lipid metabolic enzymes, including upregulation of fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase, and downregulation of carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), collectively promoting tumor growth and metastasis. These enzymatic changes are orchestrated through complex signaling pathways, notably the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, and manifest in altered membrane lipid composition, particularly within lipid microdomains that influence both cell signaling and drug resistance. Clinically, OSCC patients demonstrate characteristic serum lipid profile alterations, including reduced levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and specific apolipoproteins, which show promise as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. Furthermore, enhanced lipid peroxidation through reactive oxygen species presents a double-edged sword in carcinogenesis, with oxidation products like malondialdehyde both contributing to mutagenesis and serving as potential diagnostic indicators. The complex interplay between lipid metabolism and tumor immunity, particularly through CD36 and sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling pathways, creates opportunities for immunometabolic interventions. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism include lipid-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems, metabolic enzyme inhibitors, and immunometabolic modulators, with promising preclinical results. Despite significant advances, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications, necessitating further research on combination therapies, biomarker validation, and personalized treatment approaches. This comprehensive review provides valuable insights for both basic researchers and clinicians, potentially facilitating the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for oral cancer management.",

OS is regarded as the gold-standard efficacy endpoint of oncological treatments but requires long follow-up. An integrated analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from phase III trials comparing perioperative therapies for resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer was conducted. Surrogacy between RFS and OS was assessed at the individual level using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (τ) and at the trial level using the coefficient of determination (R²). A τ of 0.8 and an R² of 0.65 were considered thresholds for a good surrogate. Twenty-two eligible trials were identified, and IPD were available from 10 randomized trials, including 2,145 patients who underwent R0 resection. The 5-year OS and RFS rates were 53.2% and 46.2%, with median OS of 6.2 and RFS of 3.6 years. For individual-level surrogacy, Kendall's τ was 0.823 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.807-0.839). Subgroup analysis by treatment modality revealed τ values of 0.830 (95% CI: 0.800-0.861) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC; n=586), and 0.827 (95% CI: 0.803-0.850) for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT; n=982). Trial-level surrogacy analysis across all 22 trials demonstrated an R2 of 0.735 (95% CI: 0.512-0.939). The surrogate threshold effect was 0.929. This study demonstrated strong individual- and trial-level surrogacy between RFS and OS in resectable esophageal cancer across all perioperative treatments.

Cutaneous melanoma comprises 94% of cases, with 104 960 US cases projected for 2025. Cutaneous melanoma presents as a new, changing, or irregularly pigmented skin lesion. Cutaneous melanoma subtypes include superficial spreading (≈70%), lentigo maligna (≈15%), nodular (≈5%), desmoplastic (≈4%), amelanotic (2%-8%), spitzoid (<2%), and acral (≈1%). Risk factors for cutaneous melanoma include UV radiation exposure, skin type (eg, skin that always burns, never tans), presence of benign and atypical nevi, and personal or family history of melanoma. Primary prevention consists of avoiding direct sunlight and indoor tanning, and photoprotection (sunscreen and sun-protective clothing). Based on United States Cancer Statistics data from 1999 to 2021, 77% of patients with cutaneous melanoma had localized disease (involving only the primary site), 9.5% had regional (nodal) disease, 4.7% had distant metastasis, and 8.8% were unstaged. Melanoma staging, which includes tumor thickness and ulceration and presence of lymph node or distant metastasis, ranges from stage 0 (melanoma in situ) to stage IV (distant metastasis). Localized melanoma (stage IA-IIA) is surgically excised, with margins of 0.5 cm to 2 cm based on depth of invasion. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended for cutaneous melanoma that is ulcerated or 0.8 mm or more thick. Following surgery, patients with stage IIB-C melanoma have improved recurrence-free survival with adjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or death, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79] for pembrolizumab and 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30-0.59] for nivolumab). For stage III disease, recurrence risk is decreased with nivolumab (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.86]), pembrolizumab (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.72]), or BRAF + MEK inhibitor therapy (dabrafenib + trametinib) (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.43-0.63]). First-line treatment for distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma is dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab. In 2017, 10-year melanoma-specific survival rates were 98% to 94% for stage IA-B, 88% to 75% for stage IIA-C, 88% for stage IIIA, 77% to 60% for stage IIIB-C, and 24% for stage IIID. In 2024, patients with distant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab had a 10-year overall survival rate of 43%. Melanoma is a common cancer in the US. Treatment for stage IA-IIA melanoma is surgical resection. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy after surgical excision improves recurrence-free survival in stages IIB-C melanoma. For stage III melanoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or BRAF + MEK inhibitor therapy decreases risk of melanoma recurrence.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and side effects of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using a gantry-based linear accelerator (LINAC) or robotic technique in a large cohort of consecutively treated medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer patients. Between March 2015 and February 2023, 401 early-stage (T1-2 N0 M0) primary lung cancer patients were treated using either LINACs (Varian VitalBeam® and TrueBeam®; Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or CyberKnife® (Accuray, Madison, WI, USA). Median age was 70 years (range 44-90). Diagnosis was based on biopsy for 37.4% of patients, while pathological confirmation was unavailable due to high risk for 62.6%. 18F‑fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) was part of the pretreatment diagnostic workup in 96% (n = 386) of the total cohort. Tumor stage distribution was T1a in 32 (8%), T1b in 179 (44.6%), T1c in 112 (27.9%), T2a in 67 (16.7%), and T2b in 11 (2.7%) patients. Applied dose schemes were identical for both LINAC and CyberKnife treatments, using risk-adapted doses of 45-60 Gy in 3 to 8 fractions, (biologically effective dose ranging from 86 to 151.2 Gy BED10). At a median follow-up of 32 months (range 2-104), the crude survival rate was 58%. Median overall survival (OS) was 63 months (95% CI: 51.1-74.8) the 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑year OS rates were 79, 68, and 56%, respectively. Actuarial local control (LC) rates were 94% at 2 years, 90% at 3 years, and 87% at 4 years. Median LC was not reached. Median local progression-free survival (LPFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 49.5 months (95% CI: 42.8-56.3) and 37 months (95% CI: 31.2.-42.8), respectively. Actuarial 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑year LPFS and PFS rates were 75, 60, and 51% and 66, 51, and 42%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, BED10 ≥ 132 Gy predicted improved LPFS, while earlier tumor stage and better ECOG performance status were associated with improved OS. No grade 3 or higher acute side effects were observed. Grade 3 late side effects occurred in 4 patients (1%), including grade 3 late pulmonary fibrosis in 3 cases and potentially treatment-related grade 3 pneumothorax in 1 patient. Rib fracture was observed in 14 cases (3%). Clinical results after SBRT at a national comprehensive cancer center demonstrate high LC and LPFS rates and favorable PFS and OS, comparable to published studies. Application of a BED10 of 132 Gy or higher shows a potential benefit in terms of LPFS and may thus be recommended in the absence of conflict with organ at risk constraints. SBRT with either LINAC or CK is proven to be a well-tolerated but still highly effective treatment for the elderly, medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer population.",

    "abstract": "Surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy represents the primary therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma, yet significant challenges remain in preventing postoperative tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Herein, an engineered sandwich-structured hydrogel scaffold (sandwich/MTO-CuHCF) loading copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CuHCF) and mitoxantrone (MTO) with multimodal therapy was developed by using in situ stacked 3D-printing technology. The sandwich architecture provided distinct compartmentalization of therapeutic agents, thereby mitigating the risk of physicochemical incompatibility. Upon implantation of the sandwich/MTO-CuHCF scaffold at the tumor resection site, CuHCF and MTO were sequentially and sustainably released. On one hand, CuHCF depleted intracellular glutathione and catalyzed a Fenton-like reaction to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, leading to effective cancer cell killing. On the other hand, the subsequently released MTO, an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent, induced DNA damage in tumor cells. Notably, the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of sandwich/MTO-CuHCF under near-infrared irradiation not only enhanced the Fenton-like reaction through localized hyperthermia but also facilitated photothermal ablation of osteosarcoma cells. Remarkably, in a mouse osteosarcoma resection model, scaffold implantation significantly inhibited tumor recurrence. Our study provides a conceptual framework for the development of implantable scaffolds to achieve effective suppression of postoperative tumor recurrence.",

This study presents a case of acromioclavicular joint infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis BCG, alongside a systematic review aimed at improving our understanding of the infection's clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes. This systematic review included all published cases of osteoarticular infections due to M. bovis BCG following intravesical BCG instillation, as identified through a PubMed search conducted up to 1 May 2025. The search used combinations of keywords related to 'BCG', 'bladder', and 'osteoarticular infection'. One additional case from our institution was added. Clinical, biological, radiological, treatment and outcome data were extracted and analyzed. We reviewed 67 cases, classified as vertebral (n = 45), prosthetic joint (n = 18), and native joint (n = 4). The affected patients were predominantly men (98.5%), with a mean age of 74.1 ± 9.2 years. The median delay in months between the first instillation and the diagnosis was 23 [IQR 13.0-48.0]. Fever was uncommon (20.5%), while elevated C-reactive protein levels were frequent (80%). Imaging (CT/MRI) played a key role in diagnosis by showing images consistent with infection in all cases in which it was used. Treatment typically involved rifampicin and isoniazid for 12 months, alongside ethambutol for two months. Outcomes were favorable in 90.6% of cases, with one death attributed to the infection. Though rare, M. bovis BCG osteoarticular infections should be considered in patients with unexplained joint symptoms following BCG therapy. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential for optimal management.",

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for articles published through January 2025. For each tumor type, we analyze characteristic clinical presentations, molecular alterations, conventional and advanced magnetic resonance imaging features, radiological-molecular correlations, and current therapeutic approaches. Emerging radiogenomic approaches utilizing artificial intelligence, including radiomics and deep learning, show promise in identifying imaging biomarkers that correlate with molecular features. This review highlights the importance of integrating radiological and molecular data for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, while acknowledging limitations in current methodologies and the need for prospective validation in larger cohorts.

We collected clinical data from patients who underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction at the Department of Breast, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between December 2019 and December 2023. We analyzed the incidence of postoperative complications and their relationship with patient clinical data and surgical parameters. We also used the BREAST-Q 2.0 Chinese version scale to assess the impact of postoperative complications on patient-reported outcomes. A total of 109 patients underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction, including 91 stage I reconstructions and 18 stage II reconstructions. Postoperative complications occurred in 26 cases (23.9%), including flap complications in 13 cases (11.9%) and abdominal donor-site complications in 13 cases (11.9%). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the overall incidence of complications was associated with high BMI and early surgery (P < 0.05). Flap complications were associated with high BMI, early surgery, and the use of internal mammary vascular branches as recipient vessels (P < 0.05). Abdominal complications were associated with previous abdominal surgery scars (P < 0.05). Approximately 20% of patients did not complete the BREAST-Q questionnaires (including the two patients who experienced total flap loss). BREAST-Q scores showed no significant differences between the surgical complication group and the no-complication group in terms of breast satisfaction, mental health, physical health-chest, physical health-abdomen, satisfaction with abdomen, sexual health, etc. (P > 0.05). Patients who underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction revealed that high BMI, neoadjuvant therapy, and abdominal incision scars may influence postoperative complications.

Low screening rates and limited engagement with disease management contribute to higher rates of liver cancer. This qualitative study aimed to explore the psychosocial factors influencing health behaviors related to hepatitis B and liver cancer, to inform the development of a public health communication campaign tailored to highly impacted communities. In collaboration with community partners, individuals identifying with each community were purposively selected to participate in this study. Fifteen focus groups, ranging in size from 7 to 12 participants, and two key informant interviews were conducted with individuals from Asian and Pacific Islander, Caribbean, and African communities in the United States (total n = 101). The Health Belief Model and Social Ecological Model guided initial codebook development, with inductive approaches capturing emergent themes identified during analysis. Participants described incomplete knowledge of hepatitis B transmission and its link to liver cancer within their communities. These influenced health beliefs and behaviors surrounding screening and care, shaping feelings of self-efficacy and uncertainty regarding prevention and management. Misperceptions about disease risk and management were reproduced within interpersonal relationships, with many describing stigma and social isolation. Family support and culturally embedded social norms were influential in healthcare decisions and seeking. This study demonstrates the multi-level influences contributing to low rates of screening and care engagement across impacted communities, highlighting key differences and similarities. These findings reinforce the importance of culturally tailored education that reflects the diversity of communities affected by hepatitis B.",

Therefore, the research is still ongoing to determine new molecular markers that would be a part of bladder cancer diagnosing approach. Based on the above, this study determined the level of HMGA2 protein in bladder cancer tissues for the purpose of investigating the possibility of proposing it as a promising diagnostic marker, as HMGA2 is an architectural transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Forty primary transitional cell bladder samples and 20 adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from patients at Al-Assad University Hospital in Damascus between March 2023 and January 2024. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess HMGA2 protein levels. The relationship between HMGA2 tissue levels and clinical variables was analyzed using the Chi-Square Independence Test. This study showed that HMGA2 protein was overexpressed in 70% of bladder cancer tissues, with no expression in normal tissues. Also, a High HMGA2 levels were noticed to be significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, higher tumor grade, and muscle invasion (p < 0.05). No significant association was found between HMGA2 levels and gender or smoking habits. HMGA2 protein is overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues and correlates with tumor progression and aggressiveness. HMGA2 can be considered a promising marker for bladder cancer. Further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and establish HMGA2 as a reliable diagnostic tool.",

TME of solid tumors contains factors exerting a range of effects on Tregs including development, recruitment, expansion, stability and their immunosuppressive activity. Anti-PD-1 secondarily causes replenishment of intratumoral Tregs, which further intensify tumor immunosuppression. Besides, Treg depletion may also compromise immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy in addition to its other adversarial effects. Thus, a desired ICI booster is to use agents preferentially acting on intratumoral Tregs. Modulation of hypoxia, and regulation of Treg-related cytokines, chemokines, receptors and chromatin modifying factors in tumor TME provide supplementary approaches to anti-PD-(L)1. Factors acting on Tregs have diverse or even dual functions in TME. Treg expansion inhibitory and immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment stimulatory effects of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), effector suppressor Treg activating and tumor-specific CD8+ T cell stimulatory effects of interleukin type 2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα, also called CD25), cell type-dependent dual activities of CXCR3 and inducible T cell costimulatory (ICOS), exposure time-dependent dual effects of glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) and CD70 on Tregs and T cells, and exposure level-dependent dual activities of IFN-γ on Tregs are examples require consideration in designing Treg-based strategies. The main direction of this review is to provide updated information about targeting modulators of intratumoral Tregs with agents/compounds aiming to expand anti-PD-(L)1 efficacy and durability in solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterised by the uncontrolled proliferation of clonal plasma cells, primarily within the bone marrow, and is still considered incurable. A significant proportion of patients relapse with drug-refractory disease, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Ferroptosis is a recently-characterised form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, linked to phospholipid peroxidation, that represents a promising approach for the treatment of MM and other cancers, that are refractory to more conventional apoptosis-inducing regimens. A better understanding of the relationship between cellular lipid composition and ferroptosis sensitivity is key to harnessing this form of programmed cell death as a therapeutic approach. In addition to the cellular proportions of phospholipids containing poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids, studies to date indicate that cholesterol levels impact not only the onset and progression of haematological malignancies but also the sensitivity of a variety of different cancers to ferroptosis. Therefore, manipulating the uptake and metabolism of lipids, including glycerophospholipids and cholesterol, may be an effective means of sensitising MM cells to ferroptosis. Findings from the limited number of studies concerning ferroptosis in MM and compelling evidence from other malignancies, provide a strong rationale for further investigation of ferroptosis as a novel therapeutic approach for MM.",

    "abstract": "With the sharp increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the disease-specific survival rate has not improved significantly. Cholesterol metabolism plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation, regulation of tumor immune escape, and tumor drug resistance. However, there are few studies on the role of cholesterol metabolism in the occurrence and development of thyroid cancer (THCA). This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of cholesterol metabolism-related genes (CMRGs) in THCA and the relationship between immune invasion and drug sensitivity. Cholesterol metabolism-related genes we identified from the molecular signatures database, and univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO) were used to construct a predictive model of cholesterol metabolism-related genes based on the TCGA-THCA dataset. The TCGA dataset was randomly divided into a training group and a validation group to verify the model's predictive value and independent prognostic effect. We then constructed a nomogram and performed enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration, and drug sensitivity analysis. Finally, TCGA-THCA and GSE33630 datasets were used to detect the expression of signature genes, which was further verified by the HPA database. Six CMRGs (FADS1, NPC2, HSD17B7, ACSL4, APOE, HMGCS2) we identified by univariate Cox and LASSO regression to construct a prognostic model for 155 genes related to cholesterol metabolism. Their prognostic value was confirmed in the validation set, and a highly accurate nomogram was constructed combined with clinical features. We found that the mortality rate of high-risk patients increased by 11.41 times, and the infiltration of immune cells in the high-risk group was significantly reduced. Moreover, through drug sensitivity analysis, we obtained sensitive drugs for different risk groups. The GSE33630 dataset verified the expression of six CMRGs, and the HPA database verified the protein expression of the NPC2 gene. Cholesterol metabolism-related features are a promising biomarker for predicting THCA prognosis and can potentially guide personalized immunization and targeted therapy.",

This study presents an improved, time-efficient method for quantifying arsenite (AsIII), arsenate (AsV), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) in commercial white and brown rice using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The method incorporates chromatographic modifiers and ion-pairing agents in the mobile phase, reducing overall retention time to less than 4 minutes while enhancing peak separation. Method optimization, focusing on the solid-to-liquid ratio (g/L) and extraction time (minutes), was validated using the certified reference material (SRM 1568b Rice Flour), with measured concentrations showing good agreement with certified values. The MMA was excluded from the final analysis due to its low concentration in rice samples and minimal risk contribution. Arsenic species in rice followed the trend AsIII > DMA > AsV. No significant association was found between As levels and country of origin, but certain brown (MR 27, MR 29) and white (MR 10, MR 14) rice samples exceeded the European Commission's limit for inorganic As. Health risk assessments showed all rice samples had a target hazard quotient above 1, indicating potential non-carcinogenic risks. Additionally, estimated cancer risks exceeded the 10-3 (1 in 1000 lifetime risk) threshold under the revised cancer slope factor (CSF) value. This optimized method offers a reliable approach for detecting and quantifying As species in rice, aiding food safety monitoring and regulatory efforts.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and there is mounting evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematologic malignancies as well as treatment resistance. Macrophages play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage mediated phagocytosis has recently emerged as a key player in blood cancers. The integrin associated protein CD47 is expressed in a variety of cancers and interacts with its ligand, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in down regulation of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is highly expressed in various cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). It is therefore postulated that blockade of the CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint has the potential to 're-awaken' macrophage mediated phagocytosis of MM plasma cells. In this review, we provide our perspective on the key pre-clinical data supporting the CD47-SIRPα axis as a therapeutic target in MM. We subsequently discuss the ongoing clinical trials which may provide the basis for future clinical translation of these agents. We also highlight key gaps in our knowledge of macrophage biology in MM which need to be addressed by future research. Finally, we present potential future directions for translational research and personalized application of macrophage-based immunotherapy in MM.",

However, the available data on the clinicopathologic risks associated with several common PTC subtypes are controversial and require more comprehensive evaluation. To address this, we conducted a systematic search of English-language databases, including PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, for studies on six PTC subtypes, including classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (CPTC), papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC), tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (TCVPTC), diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC), and columnar cell papillary thyroid carcinoma (CCVPTC). Our case-control study of clinicopathological prognostic analyses of six subtypes, with a search date of January 2000 to May 2024. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias according to set criteria. R software gemtc package, Stata 15.1 software were applied to perform reticulated Meta-analysis methods were applied to compare the clinicopathological features and prognostic assessment of classic papillary thyroid carcinoma and the other five subtypes in all the studies.The risk of distant metastasis was higher in patients with CCVPTC, TCVPTC, and DSVPTC than in CPTC.FVPTC and PTMC exhibit a lower risk of in situ tumor relapse compared to CPTC. The tumour size of TCVPTC was significantly larger than that of CPTC, while there was no significant difference in the tumour size of CCV, DSV, FVPTC, CPTC and PTMC. DSVPTC was significantly more multifocal than the other subtypes. This network meta-analysis confirms the aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis associated with TCVPTC, DSVPTC, and CCVPTC. Therefore, these subtypes should be managed aggressively with total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection if diagnosed preoperatively. In contrast, FVPTC and PTMC are less aggressive and have a better prognosis, suggesting that treatment and follow-up strategies for PTC should be tailored according to the histopathological subtype.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is traditionally viewed as a risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes. This study evaluated whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) independently affected intraoperative and postoperative outcomes following colon cancer resection, and whether these effects varied by anatomical site. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent colon cancer resection at a single institution from 2015 to 2022. Patients were stratified by BMI (≥ 30 kg/m2 vs < 30 kg/m2) and further grouped by urgency (elective or emergency) and anatomical subsite (right- vs left-sided). Primary outcomes were intraoperative complications, severe postoperative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥ III), conversion to open surgery, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among the 737 patients, 33.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30). Obese patients were younger and had higher rates of hypertension (55% vs 46%, p = 0.01), diabetes (25% vs 16%, p < 0.01), and respiratory disease (22% vs 11%, p < 0.01). In the overall cohort, obesity was not associated with increased rates of intraoperative complications, severe postoperative complications, conversion to open surgery, or 30-day mortality. In elective resections, obesity was independently associated with increased likelihood of ICU admission (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.08-3.09; p = 0.02), while in emergent resections obesity was independently associated with higher intra-operative complications (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.19-3.97; p = 0.01). Stratified analysis by resection site revealed that obesity was an independent risk factor associated with intraoperative complications (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.47; p = 0.04) and ICU admission (aOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.61-6.23; p < 0.01) following left-sided colectomy, but not right-sided surgery. Obesity was not associated with adverse outcomes following colon cancer surgery overall. However, when stratified by anatomical subsite, obesity was independently associated with increased perioperative risk in left-sided resections. These findings support a more nuanced approach to operative planning and perioperative risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is poor. Therefore, searching for new therapeutic agents is particularly important to improve therapeutic efficacy. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating DLBCL. In this study, we investigated the role of the deubiquitase inhibitor Spautin-1 in the treatment of DLBCL. Spautin-1 significantly inhibited the growth of DLBCL, including the growth of cells and transplanted tumors in mice. Notably, Spautin-1 showed enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent versus immunodeficient mice models, mediated by CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Mechanistically, Spautin-1 promotes PANoptosis by inducing mitochondrial damage mediated by USP13-ACLY inhibition in DLBCL cells, which in turn induces the release of injury-related molecular patterns and cytokines. Moreover, high USP13 expression in DLBCL is associated with poor prognosis and blocks CD8+ T cell infiltration. In summary, Spautin-1 may inhibit the growth of DLBCL cells by promoting mitochondrial damage-mediated PANoptosis and anti-tumor immunity, providing a potential strategy for DLBCL therapy.",

NETs are extremely rare and appear to behave similarly to NETs of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, SCNECs and LCNECs are aggressive tumors with important clinical relevance, as they have a poor prognosis and require aggressive treatment.Therapy-associated neuroendocrine prostate carcinomas (t-NEPC) are recognized as a distinct entity for the first time in the WHO classification (5th edition, 2022). It arises through transdifferentiation via epigenetic changes following androgen deprivation and is characterized by AR loss and high proliferation, among other features. As with primary NE carcinomas, aggressive therapy is indicated. Therefore, a follow-up biopsy is recommended for castration-resistant progressive prostate cancer to confirm this aggressive phenotype. Neuroendokrine (NE) Zellen in der Prostata gehören zum diffusen neuroendokrinen System und finden sich in der normalen Prostata und in azinären Adenokarzinomen, teilweise auch mit Paneth-Zell-ähnlicher Morphologie.NE-Zellen produzieren Peptidhormone und biogene Amine, die parakrin die Differenzierung und das Wachstum der Prostatadrüsen beeinflussen. Sie zeigen jedoch keine proliferative Aktivität und besitzen keinen Androgenrezeptor (AR).Prostatatumoren mit NE-Differenzierung werden in 5 Gruppen eingeteilt: (1) azinäre Adenokarzinome mit partieller, nur immunhistochemisch erkennbarer NE-Differenzierung, (2) Adenokarzinome mit Paneth-Zell-ähnlicher Differenzierung, (3) NE-Tumoren/Karzinoide (NET), (4) kleinzellige NE-Karzinome (SCNEC) und (5) großzellige NE-Karzinome (LCNEC).Die Bedeutung partieller und Paneth-Zell-ähnlicher Differenzierung in Adenokarzinomen wird diskutiert und spielt im diagnostischen Alltag eine untergeordnete Rolle. NET sind äußerst selten und scheinen sich wie NET des Gastrointestinaltraktes zu verhalten. Die SCNEC und LCNEC sind hingegen aggressive Tumoren mit wichtiger klinischer Bedeutung, da sie eine schlechte Prognose besitzen und eine aggressive Therapie nötig ist.Das therapieassoziierte neuroendokrine Prostatakarzinom (t-NEPC) ist in der 5. Auflage der WHO-Klassifikation (2022) erstmals eine eigene Entität. Es entsteht durch Transdifferenzierung via epigenetischer Veränderungen nach Androgenentzug und weist u. a. einen AR-Verlust und eine hohe Proliferation auf. Wie bei den primären neuroendokrinen Karzinomen ist eine aggressive Therapie indiziert. Daher ist bei kastrationsresistenten progredienten Prostatakarzinomen eine Verlaufsbiopsie zum Nachweis dieses aggressiven Phänotyps zu empfehlen.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether deep learning (DL)-based image quality (IQ) assessment of T2-weighted images (T2WI) could be biased by the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). In this three-center retrospective study, five abdominal radiologists categorized IQ of 2,105 transverse T2WI series into optimal, mild, moderate, and severe degradation. An IQ classification model was developed using 1,719 series (development set). The agreement between the model and radiologists was assessed using the remaining 386 series with a quadratic weighted kappa. The model was applied to 11,723 examinations that were not included in the development set and without documented prostate cancer at the time of MRI (patient age, 65.5 ± 8.3 years [mean ± standard deviation]). Examinations categorized as mild to severe degradation were used as target groups, whereas those as optimal were used to construct matched control groups. Case-control matching was performed to mitigate the effects of pre-MRI confounding factors, such as age and prostate-specific antigen value. The proportion of patients with csPCa was compared between the target and matched control groups using the chi-squared test. The agreement between the model and radiologists was moderate with a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.53. The mild-moderate IQ-degraded groups had significantly higher csPCa proportions than the matched control groups with optimal IQ: moderate (N = 126) vs. optimal (N = 504), 26.3% vs. 22.7%, respectively, difference = 3.6% [95% confidence interval: 0.4%, 6.8%], p = 0.03; mild (N = 1,399) vs. optimal (N = 1,399), 22.9% vs. 20.2%, respectively, difference = 2.7% [0.7%, 4.7%], p = 0.008. The DL-based IQ tended to be worse in patients with csPCa, raising concerns about its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, and its relationship with kidney fibrosis and inflammatory responses has attracted considerable attention. However, whether causal relationships exist among these associations remains unclear, as traditional observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors. To evaluate causal relationships between kidney cancer, kidney fibrosis, and inflammatory factors using Mendelian randomization, and explore tumor microenvironment heterogeneity through single-cell analysis. Based on large-scale GWAS data, bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to assess causal relationships between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis, using MR Egger, inverse variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods. Causal associations between kidney cancer and inflammatory factors including Axin-1, C-C motif chemokine 28, and interleukin-10 receptor subunit were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database (GSM4819725) was integrated for tumor microenvironment analysis. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis revealed no significant causal relationship between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis [kidney cancer→kidney fibrosis: IVW OR=0.992(95%CI: 0.913-1.077, P=0.842); kidney fibrosis→kidney cancer: IVW OR=0.922(95%CI: 0.824-1.030, P=0.151)]. However, significant positive causal associations were identified between kidney cancer and multiple inflammatory factors: Axin-1 levels [OR=1.448(95%CI: 1.107-1.894, P=0.007)], C-C motif chemokine 28 [OR=1.287(95%CI: 1.076-1.540, P=0.006)], and interleukin-10 receptor subunit [OR=1.135(95%CI: 1.032-1.248, P=0.009)]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results. Single-cell analysis revealed cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, including various cell types such as immune cells, T cells, and NK cells, with pseudotime analysis demonstrating cell differentiation trajectories and dynamic gene expression changes. Mendelian randomization analysis provides genetic evidence for causal relationships between kidney cancer and inflammatory factors, while excluding direct causal associations between kidney cancer and kidney fibrosis.",

This retrospective study analyzed data from 37 cases with hard palate and gingival cancer who received Au-mold therapy alone. Treatment outcomes and complications were evaluated, and the dose distribution of Au-mold therapy was simulated using clinically available calculation systems. A notable 5-year local control rate of approximately 80% was noted in primary cases, whereas recurrent cases exhibited lower local control rates. Severe oral mucositis was not observed, and late complications, such as osteoradionecrosis and oral ulceration, were infrequent following Au-mold therapy. This study provides insights into the use of Au-mold therapy for oral cancer. Promising outcomes in primary cases suggest its potential as a treatment option. Future research should focus on innovative strategies to enhance the efficacy of Au-mold therapy in oral cancer management.",

The comorbidity between heart failure and breast cancer has attracted researchers' attention, while inflammatory factors and various cancer-related molecular pathways may play important roles in this association. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology, using multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables, to investigate the genetic association between breast cancer and heart failure. Additionally, we further analyzed the relationships between different breast cancer subtypes. The study found a significant positive genetic association between breast cancer and heart failure risk, which was consistently verified across different breast cancer subtypes. Various cancer-related molecular pathways showed different degrees of association with breast cancer risk: activation of KRAS, SHH, EGFR, and VEGF pathways was associated with increased breast cancer risk; activation of CASP8 apoptosis pathway and MITK/ATM DNA repair pathway may have protective effects; the AANAT (melatonin synthesis-related) pathway showed significant protective effects; while the NQO/NRF2 oxidative stress pathway exhibited dual roles. This study aimed primarily to investigate the potential genetic association between breast cancer and heart failure using MR. Secondary objectives included exploring associations between breast cancer subtypes and heart failure, as well as examining the involvement of inflammatory and cancer-related molecular pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by complex genetic and molecular alterations. The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 6 (PTPN6), also known as SHP-1, plays a critical role in regulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways, with emerging evidence suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. Previous studies have linked aberrant PTPN6 expression to tumorigenesis in specific cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. However, the comprehensive role of PTPN6 across pan-cancer, particularly its prognostic significance and molecular functions, has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to provide a pan-cancer analysis of PTPN6, utilizing data from multiple public databases with molecular in vitro experiments. Our findings showed notable differences in PTPN6 expression among different cancer types. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher PTPN6 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in with notable upregulation in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ). Further, promoter methylation and mutation analyses highlighted alterations in PTPN6 expression across different cancer stages, with a particular reduction in methylation observed in tumor tissues. Functional assays in cell lines demonstrated that PTPN6 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, supporting its role in cancer progression. This comprehensive analysis emphasizes the potential of PTPN6 as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer. However, further research is required to fully elucidate its role in cancer progression and to assess its clinical applicability.",

The patient shares her story of resilience up to her AML diagnosis and treatment, through the bone marrow transplant, and then on to the challenges faced as an immunocompromised patient during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The haematologist offers detailed insights into AML and treatment options, including chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. She comments on the challenging journey of her patient, and the complexities of managing immunocompromised patients during the pandemic, who failed to respond sufficiently to vaccination. In addition, she outlines the prophylactic strategy implemented in her centre, and the introduction of alternative immunisation with monoclonal antibodies for this high-risk immunocompromised patient population. This case provides a unique combination of personal patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and medical insights. In this article, a haematologist and her immunocompromised patient discuss the challenges associated with vaccination in highly immunocompromised individuals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following chemotherapy for breast cancer. She describes her AML diagnosis and treatment, and subsequent bone marrow transplant, and how she managed as an immunocompromised person during the pandemic, including the issues associated with COVID-19 vaccination and how these were managed, and her ongoing approaches to protecting herself from infection. The patient’s haematologist outlines the characteristics of AML and the treatment options for the disease, including chemotherapy and allotransplantation, and the immunosuppression that followed the latter. She comments on the experiences of her patient and on the complexities of managing immunocompromised patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly how to manage insufficient response to vaccination. The haematologist describes the COVID-19 vaccination plan implemented by the transplant centre in which she works, and the centre’s introduction of alternative immunisation using a combination of the monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab for high-risk immunocompromised patients. After 5 years of monitoring, the patient is showing signs of recovery from AML. Currently, she does not require immunosuppressant treatment, she is gradually responding to vaccines and her immune function is normalising. This article provides medical insights into the vaccination challenges in highly immunocompromised patients and offers hope for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent cytosolic enzyme, and a growing body of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in cancer progression. Recently, NNMT has a role in methylation metabolism and tumorigenesis and was associated with a poor prognosis against numerous cancers. In addition, it has been reported that NNMT has been overexpressed in the stroma of advanced high-grade serous carcinoma and may contribute to decreased survival. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to predict resistance and investigate their clinicopathologic significance in paclitaxel-resistant advanced or recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). Fluorescence-labeled two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), immunohistochemical, and MASCOT analyses allowed us to identify the cytoplasmic metabolic enzyme NNMT. In cultured cell studies, NNMT protein expression was higher in paclitaxel-resistant OVMANA and OVTOKO cells than in paclitaxel-sensitive KK and ES-2 cells. Furthermore, although analysis of clinical tissue samples showed no association with poor prognosis in 7 individuals with low NNMT expression in the cytoplasm of OCCC cells, high expression of NNMT in the cytoplasm of OCCC cells may be associated with low sensitivity to paclitaxel in OCCC and may have prognostic implications. Therefore, targeting therapy to reduce cytoplasmic NNMT expression levels may increase the sensitivity of OCCC to paclitaxel.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the most recent evidence regarding complications, perioperative outcomes, and pathological results associated with extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) in comparison to intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) during robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to facilitate this comparison. We conducted a thorough systematic review of relevant studies by systematically searching several databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, to assess the implications of ICUD versus ECUD in the context of RARC. The examination of binary variables employed relative risk (RR) measurements, whereas weighted mean differences (WMD) served as the primary metric for evaluating continuous variable outcomes. Twenty-two studies involving 8030 patients were included, of which 3755 received ICUD and 4278 received ECUD. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two cohorts. The study showed that the ICUD cohort had a notably lower rate of severe complications in the late phase (30-90 day) [RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54, 0.94, p = 0.016] than the ECUD group. Furthermore, the rate of intraoperative transfusions was notably less in ICUD, with a RR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.47, 0.84, p = 0.002). Likewise, the estimated blood loss (EBL) in the ICUD cohort was decreased, reflected by a WMD of - 131.4 (95% CI - 153.24 to - 111.03, p < 0.001). Additionally, length of stay for patients in the ICUD cohort showed a notably decrease, indicated by a WMD of - 1.87 (95% CI - 3.34, - 0.41, p = 0.004). Nonetheless, there was still no notable variation between the two cohorts regarding early (30 days) complications, mid-term (30-90 days) mild complications, rehospitalization rates, operative time (OT), postoperative venting time, tumor recurrence rates, ureteroenteric stricture (UES), and oncologic outcomes. Overall, RARC with ICUD demonstrated a greater safety profile than ECUD in terms of reduced late serious complication rates, transfusion rates, EBL, and length of hospitalization, along with similar efficacy. Although ICUD has good potential for clinical dissemination, further substantial follow-up data are required to substantiate its effectiveness.",

This study involves a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions, such as acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and moxibustion, in improving gastrointestinal function and quality of life in patients undergoing chemotherapy. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases up to March 13, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved the comparison of non-pharmacological TCM interventions with standard pharmacological treatments in adult patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Primary outcomes included the quality of life measured by the Karnofsky Performance Status scale, gastrointestinal function measured by complete response rates, and objective response rates. Data were analyzed using Bayesian network meta-analysis methods, with outcomes presented as odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) along with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). A total of 37 RCTs involving 3268 participants were included in the review. The findings highlighted the significant efficacy of specific TCM interventions. The top-ranked intervention for improving Karnofsky Performance Status scores was electroacupuncture at the Geshu point combined with medication, with a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value of 80.3%. For complete response rates, a combination of acupuncture, auricular point sticking, and medication emerged as the most effective method, with a SUCRA value of 88.0%. Additionally, for enhancing objective response rates, the combination of moxibustion at the Zusanli point and medication was identified as the leading intervention, with a SUCRA value of 80.3%. Non-pharmacological TCM interventions were effective in significantly improving gastrointestinal function and quality of life in patients undergoing chemotherapy, representing modalities that viably complement standard pharmacological treatments. Our findings support the integration of these TCM practices into oncology care, emphasizing the need for further high-quality research to establish comprehensive clinical guidelines. This integrative strategy aligns with the principles of patient-centered care, promoting a more holistic approach to cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally, with cellular senescence having a complex role in its progression. Senescence is linked to chronic inflammation via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, activated by cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs) marked by histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3), is crucial for SASP production. This study investigates the potential of a natural flavonoid, Chrysin, as a senomorphic agent that targets these CCF markers to reduce inflammation in senescent breast cancer cells. We induced senescence in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells using doxorubicin and analyzed the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 after treatment with various concentrations of Chrysin through qRT-PCR. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed significantly reduced CCF markers H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, along with decreased STING phosphorylation. Notably, Chrysin did not change the expression of senescent markers p16 or p21. Additionally, Chrysin effectively inhibited SASP-driven breast cancer cell invasion and colony formation, highlighting its potential as both an anti-inflammatory agent and a senomorphic drug. Chrysin notably decreases H3K9me3 and H3K27me3-marked CCF levels, suppressing cGAS-STING pathway activation and reducing IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Our findings indicate that Chrysin represents a promising therapeutic strategy, targeting the epigenetic landscape of CCFs and modulating the SASP to mitigate the harmful effects of senescent cells in the tumor microenvironment.",

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation, a crucial post-translational modification, undergoes alterations in glycan structures. IgG N-glycosylation is associated with numerous physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Aberrant changes of IgG N-glycosylation play a key role in cancers given the involvement of glycans in cancer progression and immune modulation. These changes affect the binding of the Fc region of IgG to its receptor, in turn, affect the corresponding downstream effects, which are crucial in cancer immuno-surveillance and immune escape.

The TCGA-LAML datasets underwent random partitioning into training and validation sets. Subsequently, a prognostic risk signature was formulated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were employed to assess the clinical significance of the signature. The results of the immune infiltration difference analyses are displayed, and the drug sensitivity analyses were used to identify potentially effective drugs for AML patients. qPCR was employed to validate the expression levels of the signature genes and compared the signature with existing signatures and mutated genes. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses have underscored the signature as an autonomous prognostic risk determinant. Scrutiny into immune infiltration has unveiled significant associations: the risk score exhibits a favorable correlation with monocyte and M2 macrophage counts but an adverse correlation with resting mast cell counts. The expression patterns of immune checkpoint genes diverge between the distinct risk cohorts. Patients categorized as high-risk demonstrate enhanced benefits from cyclopamine, 443654, and 770041, whereas those classified as low-risk exhibit more pronounced advantages from cytarabine and AZD6244. The risk signature demonstrates superior prognostic accuracy compared to established signatures and mutated genes.

PTEN loss has emerged as a promising biomarker for predicting aggressive disease. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of PTEN status in patients diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 213 patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsy with available PTEN testing between 2020 and 2023 at a referral center. Patients who underwent RP with undetectable postoperative PSA levels and a minimum follow-up of three months were included. The primary outcome was the prognostic value of PTEN status. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test, while Cox regression models identified predictors of BCR. Overall, 36/213 (17%) patients exhibited PTEN loss. These patients had more aggressive disease, characterized by higher clinical stage and ISUP grade group (p ≤ 0.01). Among the 56 patients treated with RP and followed for a median of 25 months, BCR-free survival was significantly lower in those with PTEN loss, especially in the intermediate-risk subgroup (log-rank test, p = 0.03). PTEN loss was identified as an independent predictor of BCR (Hazard Ratio: 8.5, p = 0.03). PTEN loss in patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsy and treated with RP is associated with worse prognosis. PTEN testing shows promise as a biomarker to improve patient counseling and guide PCa treatment decisions. Prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings fully.",

After multivariable adjustment, lymphoma was significantly associated with increased risks of myocarditis/pericarditis (HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.26-4.63), heart failure/cardiomyopathy (HR: 2.65, 95% CI: 2.26-3.11), atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.58-2.04), valve diseases (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.47-2.19), conduction system disease (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.37-1.98), supraventricular arrhythmias (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.17), peripheral arterial disease (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.18-1.84), and ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34). Risk varied significantly across lymphoma subtypes, with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral/cutaneous T-cell lymphomas exhibiting particularly elevated risks for several outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension status significantly modified some associations. Lymphoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of multiple CVDs. Findings highlight the need for cardiovascular risk assessment and tailored management in lymphoma survivors, considering subtype and individual risk factors.",

We thus examine the outcomes of PCNSL in a multiethnic Asian population treated with HD-MTX-based chemotherapy and consolidation WBRT, so as to benchmark current treatment outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study involving patients (n = 129) diagnosed with PCNSL at the National Cancer Centre Singapore from 2000 to 2019. The median follow-up duration was 47.0 months. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional models. The cohort consisted of 76 male and 53 female patients with a median age of 60 years. 85 patients received HD-MTX-based induction therapy as per DeAngelis, while 44 were treated with the Shah protocol. In univariate analyses, male sex, ECOG scores ≥ 1, non-germinal center subtype, use of DeAngelis protocol, and methotrexate dose < 3 g/m2 were significantly correlated with worse PFS and OS. In a multivariate model, the Shah protocol conferred significantly improved outcomes as compared with the DeAngelis protocol for PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.73, p = 0.0019) and OS (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.59, p = 0.0004). Using gene expression profiling, poor risk PCNSL patients had a higher trend of CD8 T-cells, macrophages and Th-1 cells, upregulation of TIGIT and HAVCR2, and downregulation in WNT11 and CD44. Our study demonstrates that contemporary HD-MTX-based chemoimmunotherapy induction regimens achieve good disease responses in PCNSL.

SNMM frequently originates in the nasal cavity, causing nonspecific nasal symptoms that inevitably delay diagnosis. Left untreated, the tumor may extend into the orbit.Case DescriptionHerein, the authors describe two patients presenting with compressive optic neuropathy and were found to have advanced SNMM involving the orbit. Both patients presented with vision loss, decreased color vision, proptosis, conjunctival chemosis, and restricted extraocular movements. One patient was found to have a relative afferent pupillary defect. Neither patient was a surgical candidate, and both received palliative radiotherapy and immunotherapy.ConclusionsThese cases and literature review demonstrate the potential for the disease to initially manifest with orbital extension and ocular symptoms. Ophthalmologists can play a crucial role in the early detection of SNMM, which may improve outcomes, given the challenges of SNMM treatment.",

We investigated whether first-round FIT concentration could predict colorectal neoplasia detection in the second screening round, using data from the randomized controlled trial Screening of Swedish Colons (SCREESCO). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of SCREESCO FIT-arm participants with negative two-stool FIT (<10 μg Hb/g feces) in the first screening round, followed by a positive FIT (≥10 μg Hb/g feces) in the second round two years later with work-up colonoscopy. We used binary regression models to assess risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, including CRC and advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN), at colonoscopy, according to participants' characteristics and first- and second-round FIT concentrations. In total, 1,991 individuals were included, with median FIT concentrations of 2.2 and 21.8 μg Hb/g feces in the first and second rounds, respectively. Higher first-round FIT concentration was associated with increased risks of CRC and ACN in the second round. Compared to those with first-round FIT concentrations of 0.0-1.9 μg Hb/g feces, the risk ratios for ACN were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.07-1.80) for 2.0-5.9 and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.38-2.48) for 6.0-9.9 μg Hb/g feces. For fixed second-round FIT concentration, the absolute risk of ACN increased in accordance with higher first-round FIT concentration. Even an increase in low levels of FIT concentration is associated with future CRC and ACN detection. Combining first- and second-round FIT results could enhance the efficacy of screening.

In this article, we approach the topic critically and discuss the areas in which the development of microbiome-based clinical applications may soon be expected. We selectively review the literature on disease-associated microbiome signatures and therapeutic modulation of the microbiome. We discuss clinical studies as well as relevant preclinical studies that reveal causal relationships between the microbiome and disease. The intestinal microbiome undergoes dynamic regulation by lifestyle factors such as the diet. Particularly in inflammatory and malignant neoplastic diseases, changes in the microbiome have been identified that contribute to the progression of disease in animal models. Studies have also shown that the response to systemic antitumor therapy is regulated by the microbiota. In view of this, initial clinical trials have been conducted that document the efficacy of fecal microbiome transfer and of selective approaches to microbiome modulation in the treatment of several inflammatory and malignant diseases. Evidence from animal models and initial clinical studies indicates that therapeutic modulation of the microbiome can be of benefit to patients suffering from a number of inflammatory and malignant diseases. The further translation of research of this kind into clinical applications will require the validation of these data in controlled trials and the development of targeted approaches to microbiome modulation.",

This study aimed to explore associations between diverse folic acid fortification policies (mandatory vs. no mandatory fortification) and global late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC) incidence rates. The study systematically assessed (i) folic acid fortification policies in 193 member states of the World Health Organization, and (ii) age-standardized LOCRC incidence rates by country. We examined the associations between folic acid fortification types and LOCRC incidence using an ecological study design. Incidence trends before and after fortification were analyzed using a log-linear joinpoint regression model, and the annual percent change and average annual percent change with 95% confidence interval were determined for representative countries with mandatory fortification (the United States [U.S.] and Canada). By September 2024, 69 countries enacted mandatory folic acid fortification legislation, while 124 had no fortification. The overall LOCRC incidence rates per 100,000 were 70.8 and 84.0 with mandatory and no mandatory fortification, respectively. The decreasing trends after implementing folic acid fortification were more rapid than in the pre-fortification period in the U.S. and Canada. These findings suggested an association between mandatory folic acid fortification policies and reduced LOCRC incidence.

    "abstract": "The only approved systemic treatments for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are KIT/PDGFRA-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which eventually lead to the development of secondary polyclonal resistance mutations. Complementary treatment strategies are urgently needed. Using transcriptomic profiling, CRISPR screens, and chemical screens, we identify aurora kinase B (AURKB) as a previously less recognized therapeutic vulnerability to advanced GISTs. AURKB is frequently overexpressed in high-risk and metastatic GISTs but not in low-/intermediate-risk GISTs across our two patient cohorts, with FOXM1 responsible for AURKB overexpression. Genetic depletion of AURKB inhibits GIST proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen further reveals that AURKB binds to and stabilizes ATAD2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, enhancing chromatin accessibility for DNA damage repair genes. Notably, AURKB inhibitors demonstrate potent efficacy in multiple preclinical GIST cell models and xenograft models at safe doses, overcoming TKI resistance. Our comprehensive approaches define unique AURKB-ATAD2 dependency in GISTs and identify non-receptor tyrosine kinase therapeutic strategies for clinical translation.",

This meta-analysis evaluated the association between occupational benzene exposure and the risk of these cancers. A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE identified 7,221 publications, with nine cohort studies meeting inclusion criteria. Summary risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using PRISMA, MOOSE, and PECOS guidelines. Study quality was assessed with a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and publication bias was evaluated via Egger's test and funnel plots. The overall summary RR for benzene exposure was 1.22 (95% CI=1.03-1.44), primarily driven by mortality (RR=1.69; 95% CI=1.18-2.41) rather than incidence (RR=1.08; 95% CI=0.91-1.29). Cancer-specific RRs were 1.24 for cervical, 1.21 for endometrial, and 1.28 for ovarian cancers, none reaching statistical significance. No significant heterogeneity was found by cancer type, region, exposure duration, industry, or study quality. No publication bias was detected (p=0.43). This analysis suggests a potential association between occupational benzene exposure and increased risk of female genital cancers, particularly in mortality data.

Enhancing practices related to infant and young child feeding (IYCF) is a suggested strategy to mitigate mortality risks and enhance nutritional conditions associated with wasting. Interventions centered on behavioral modifications through IYCF counseling hold promise in increasing the effectiveness of IYCF practices. In this review we sought to study the impact of intensive IYCF counseling interventions for preventing wasting and nutritional edema among infants and children up to 5 years of age. We searched 9 electronic databases for articles published up to July 2021, and conducted an updated search on Ovid MEDLINE and MEDLINE for articles published until April 13, 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. Two review authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Our outcomes included prevalence of wasting and underweight, deterioration to severe wasting, anthropometric outcomes (weight-for-height z-score, weight-for-age z-score) and child morbidity and mortality. We summarized the findings of this review for primary outcomes according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. A total of 10 studies from 17 records were found to be eligible for inclusion, and all of these studies were meta-analyzed. Evidence suggests that compared to controls, IYCF counseling is likely to have little to no impact on the prevalence of wasting (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.04; 10 studies; GRADE: moderate). Intensive IYCF counseling had little to no impact on WHZ, MUAC, or WAZ and had an uncertain impact on the prevalence of diarrhea, fever, cough, and underweight (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.97; 8 studies; GRADE: very low). Nutrition education and counseling showed uncertain GRADE evidence on reducing prevalence of underweight but had no association with wasting.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dyslipidemia can occur as a long-term side effect of childhood cancer treatment. The difference in prevalence among children receiving comparable treatment suggests a role for genetic variation. We conducted the first genome-wide association study on dyslipidemia in a large childhood cancer survivor cohort, using three additional cohorts for replication. METHODS Discovery analysis was performed in the Original Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort (N=4,332). Replication analyses were carried out in the CCSS Expansion cohort (N=2,212), the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE, N=2,829), and the DCCSS-LATER Cohort (N=1,814). In the CCSS cohorts, dyslipidemia was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 self-reported high cholesterol or high triglycerides, whereas in SJLIFE and DCCSS-LATER, it was assessed by serum lipid measurements. Association analysis was performed in the entire cohort and stratified by cancer treatment. RESULTS The initial discovery analysis yielded one genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8) and 16 suggestive (p<5x10-6) loci associated with dyslipidemia risk. Of these, one genome-wide significant and eight suggestive loci with biological plausibility were selected for replication analysis, but none replicated. Additionally, treatment-stratified analysis revealed six significant (p<5x10-8) loci, none of which replicated in meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Further research with clinically assessed data and larger sample sizes is needed to explore the genetic contributions to dyslipidemia risk in childhood cancer survivors. IMPACT The establishment of larger, internationally collaborative consortia of childhood cancer survivors is critical for generating more robust findings, which will help the identification of those survivors at risk for dyslipidemia and subsequently cardiovascular disease.",

Methods The study included 40,205 women (aged 50-79 years at enrollment) who were never-smokers/non-drinkers at enrollment. Information on reproductive, health, and lifestyle factors was obtained at baseline. Diabetes was reported at baseline and during follow-up. Pancreatic cancer cases were centrally adjudicated. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Results Over an average follow-up of 16.6 years, 336 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were ascertained. High body mass index (HR≥35vs ≥18.5-<20kg/m2 1.42, 95%CI1.02-2.01), large height-adjusted waist circumference (HR≥88vs<80cm 1.51, 95%CI1.16-1.97), and diabetes (HR 1.53, 95%CI1.18-1.98) were associated with increased risk.

SIL/CBX-loaded NE enhances the anticancer effects of SIL/CBX against prostate cancer (PCa) in vitro and in vivo, while it could simultaneously reduce the systemic toxicity of SIL/CBX. The NE-SIL/CBX was prepared using oleic acid as the oil phase, Tween-80 and Cremophor RH40 as the surfactants and Transcutol HP, as the cosurfactant. The optimized NE formulation exhibited a particle size of 204.30 ± 10.20 nm, an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 95.30%, and sustained stability under biological and storage conditions. In vitro studies demonstrated a 6.80-fold improvement in cytotoxicity against PCa cells (IC50 = 6.30 µM) compared to the free SIL/CBX combination, while maintaining 62.10% cell viability in normal cells (HEK293) at 100 µg/mL, indicating reduced off-target toxicity compared to free SIL/CBX combination. In vivo, NE-SIL/CBX reduced tumor volume by 78.90% and tumor weight by 80.00% while maintaining stable liver and kidney function, highlighting its safety. The formulation's controlled drug release (87.60% of drug release for SIL and 78.50% of drug release for CBX after 72 h) and synergistic therapeutic effects significantly (P ˂ 0.05) enhanced efficacy compared to free SIL and CBX. These findings establish NE-SIL/CBX as a promising platform for PCa treatment, offering improved therapeutic index and reduced systemic toxicity.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has significantly advanced the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients who develop resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. However, most patients inevitably develop resistance to the treatment, which presents a major challenge for long-term disease control. The molecular mechanisms underlying osimertinib resistance are complex and are generally categorized into EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent pathways. To address this issue, various therapeutic strategies have been explored. These include the development of fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs, novel targeted agents, and combination therapies involving molecular inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapeutic agents, and gene inhibitors. In addition, nanomaterials, particularly selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), have emerged as promising tools to overcome drug resistance. These nanomaterials can be used to enhance osimertinib delivery, improve its bioavailability, and modulate key resistance pathways at the cellular and molecular levels. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and highlights cutting-edge therapeutic approaches. Special attention is given to nanotechnology-based strategies, which offer new possibilities for personalized and precise treatment of NSCLC. A deeper insight into these molecular mechanisms is essential for improving the clinical efficacy of osimertinib and prolonging the survival of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The novel resistant-related genes, miRNAs, and lncRNAs are found to be involved in osimertinib resistance.Development of novel drugs, combination therapy with molecular targeted inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapeutic agents, and gene inhibitors will overcome osimertinib resistance.Nanomaterials will be a potential strategy for overcoming osimertinib resistance through combination with osimertinib or delivery of drugs carriers for targeted therapy.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the drug's cardiotoxic effects on the ejection fraction (EF) of dogs in doxorubicin protocols. The search was done in eight databases, with a total of 3587 articles screened, resulting in fifteen eligible articles included. A report on the included studies' methods and results was done. It also assessed the risk of bias. Thirteen articles demonstrated cardiac changes in echocardiography with different routes of administration (intravenous and intracoronary). The intracoronary route was more toxic, and in all six studies performed, there was heart failure. The intravenous route caused heart failure in six of the nine studies. A meta-analysis showed this drug worsened heart disease. It included four studies where it significantly lowered the EF. Overall, the intervention produced a mean reduction of 21.24% in EF. This review shows doxorubicin's impact on cardiac function. It reveals the need for careful monitoring of each patient.",

Yatein, a biogenic precursor of deoxypodophyllotoxin possesses antitumor effects. Herein, we explored its antitumor effect in breast cancer. Yatein significantly inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells by MTT, colony formation, EdU assay, and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, yatein suppressed the stemness of cancer cells, causing inhibition of migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanism study revealed that yatein inhibited TOP2A activity and stabilized TOP2A-DNA cleavage complexes, caused DNA damage and apoptosis, suggesting its potential in the treatment of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity and the complex immune microenvironment make it challenging to identify candidates for immunotherapy using dominant biomarkers. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells, particularly CD103+CD8+ tissue-resident T cells and their specific subsets, are generally linked to better outcomes in many cancers, but their role in renal cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that tumor-infiltrating CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+ tissue-resident T cells can serve as an unfavorable prognostic factor for ccRCC patients and may be related to PD-1 treatment outcomes. We assessed the infiltration of CD103+CD8+T, CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+T and other CD8+T cell subsets in ccRCC using multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and evaluated their links to patient clinicopathological features and prognosis. With published single-cell data from ccRCC patients treated with PD-1 therapy, we studied the expression differences of hnRNPA2B1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells between responders and nonresponders. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the infiltration levels of CD103+CD8+T, CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+T cells, and CD103+CD8+Bhlhe40+T cells in ccRCC tissues were all significantly higher (all P values were <0.01). Moreover, patients with a higher degree of infiltration of these cells had worse overall survival (HR = 0.3490, 95% CI: 0.09338 to 1.304, P = 0.0144). All of them can serve as independent prognostic factors for ccRCC patients (HR = 3.753, 95% CI: 1.317 to 10.693, P = 0.013). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells in patients responding to PD-1 antibody treatment had higher hnRNPA2B1 expression compared with nonresponders. In summary, our study indicates that tumor-infiltrating CD103+CD8+hnRNPA2B1+ tissue-resident T cells can serve as predictive factors and indicators for unfavorable prognosis and patient responses to PD-1 treatment outcomes in ccRCC patients.",

    "abstract": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have gained interest as a tool for predicting drug transfer to human milk and assessing the exposure levels in infants. Our group previously developed an integrated lactation PBPK model framework to understand the transfer of drugs into milk and the resulting exposure in infants. As a part of the framework, the current paper focuses on performance of lactation PBPK models to predict maternal plasma and milk concentrations for drugs that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters-atenolol, escitalopram, and alprazolam. PBPK models for healthy adult subjects were developed for atenolol and escitalopram in Simcyp v23 and verified against clinical data. For alprazolam, the Simcyp library model was used. The built-in lactation compartment in Simcyp was utilized for the three drugs. Atenolol and escitalopram adult healthy PBPK models showed agreement of plasma concentration-time profiles with respective clinical data. The lactation PBPK models predicted milk concentration profiles with reasonable agreement for all three drugs as well. The predicted milk concentration-time profile, milk pharmacokinetic parameters and milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratio of atenolol, alprazolam, and escitalopram were within 2-fold of the reported values, suggesting agreement between simulation and clinical data. The current work shows the potential of lactation PBPK models to predict drug exposure in human milk for drugs that are not P-gp or BCRP substrates. The approach will be further evaluated for drugs that are substrates for these active transporters known to be present in mammary tissues.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis has been considered a promising therapeutic approach for various diseases. In this study, by integrating pseudonatural concepts with our newly developed rhodium-catalyzed C-H activation/Lossen rearrangement/oxa-Michael addition methodology, we rapidly assembled diverse benzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine PNP derivatives and systematically evaluated their antiferroptotic activity. Among these compounds, 4k exhibited significant activity in suppressing ferroptosis. We further elucidated that 4k acts as a novel and specific inhibitor of ferritinophagy by targeting NCOA4 and disrupting its interaction with ferritin. Subsequent results demonstrated that 4k effectively ameliorated ConA-induced acute liver injury. Collectively, our findings indicate that 4k, featuring benzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine PNP scaffolds, acts as a selective inhibitor and could serve as a potential lead compound for further research. This work suggests that pharmacological targeting of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction represents a promising intervention strategy for ferroptosis-related diseases.",

This study is based on data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 to analyze trends in cancer deaths and predict future burdens. The burden of disease was assessed by aggregating age-standardized mortality rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Analyze the correlation between socio-demographic indices (SDIs) and gender and cancer incidence. Calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and its corresponding 95% uncertainty interval (UI) to summarize the overall trend. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict future trends. Cancer mortality from malignant tumors due to high metabolic risk has been trending upward each year over the past 30 years in middle SDI, low-middle SDI, and low SDI areas. The highest growth rates of increase were 51% in the low-middle SDI region, the AAPC values of 2.488 and 2.480 deaths and DALYs per 100,000 population, respectively. Cancer mortality rates in the medium-high SDI region decreased slightly after 2019. The ARIMA model predicts that mortality and DALYs will continue to rise steadily through 2050. The findings suggest the need for targeted health promotion outreach and clinical interventions supported by sustained medical inputs to more effectively manage the growing global cancer burden.",

    "abstract": "Chemokines are essential mediators of immune responses, and the CCL20/CCR6 chemokine signaling axis is known to be involved in inflammation, infectious diseases, and cancer progression. However, the role of the CCL20/CCR6 axis in host defense against Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis remains unknown. We hypothesized that the CCL20/CCR6 axis is critical for the recruitment and activation of immune cells against S. aureus, and the lack of CCL20 or its monogamous receptor CCR6 leads to exacerbation of S. aureus osteomyelitis. In vitro studies confirmed that osteoblasts and macrophages (M0 and M2 subtypes) secrete CCL20 following S. aureus exposure. Implant-associated osteomyelitis in C57BL/6, CCL20-/-, and CCR6-/- mice revealed an early increase in planktonic bacterial growth on day 1 and increased bacterial loads in soft tissue and bone on day 14 post-infection in both CCL20-/- and CCR6-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed that CCL20-/- and CCR6-/- mice have impaired recruitment of T cells, especially CCR6+ T cells, to the site of infection. Interestingly, CCR6-/- mice exhibited increases in osteoclast numbers, reactive bone formation, and reduced bone mineral density. In a clinical pilot study, we observed a fivefold increase in serum CCL20 levels (P < 0.05) in S. aureus osteomyelitis patients (n = 23) vs uninfected controls (n = 10). Remarkably, serum CCL20 levels immediately following septic death were 100-fold higher vs uninfected patients (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results highlight the critical role of CCL20/CCR6-mediated host immunity during the establishment of S. aureus osteomyelitis and the potential of CCL20 as a biomarker of osteomyelitis-induced sepsis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen in orthopedic infections, and hard-to-treat strains (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) cause >50% of these infections. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop immunotherapies to treat these life-threatening infections. The role of the CCL20/CCR6 chemokine signaling axis on S. aureus osteomyelitis is unknown. In our efforts to uncover its role, we reveal that osteoblasts and macrophages secrete CCL20 in response to infection, and mice lacking CCL20 or its monogamous receptor CCR6 are more susceptible to S. aureus osteomyelitis. Mechanistically, we observed that increased infection severity in the knockout mice is associated with decreased T cell recruitment and increased osteoclastogenesis at the bone infection site. Importantly, in a clinical pilot study, we observed that CCL20 can be a useful biomarker of osteomyelitis-induced septic death. Overall, our study highlights the crucial immunomodulatory role that the CCL20/CCR6 axis plays during osteomyelitis.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11), involved in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and autophagy, is overexpressed in breast cancer and correlates with poor clinical outcomes. However, its exact mechanisms remain largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that inhibiting CDK11 suppresses cell proliferation and migration and induces autophagy in breast cancer cells. The use of chloroquine (CQ) and ATG7 knockdown to block autophagy reversed the proliferation and migration inhibition caused by CDK11 reduction, indicating that induced autophagy suppresses breast cancer. Gene expression profiling revealed that CDK11 knockdown significantly downregulated the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2. Further studies showed that overexpression of BCL-2 partially reversed the autophagy and the inhibition of proliferation and migration induced by CDK11 knockdown. Additionally, a mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor model showed that BCL-2 overexpression partially rescued the tumor growth inhibition and reduction of LC3 expression induced by CDK11 knockdown. Taken together, these data reveal that inhibition of CDK11 induces autophagy and that CDK11 mediates autophagy to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, with BCL-2 playing an important regulatory role in this process. These findings highlight that CDK11 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast cancer.",

Integrative ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analyses further show that LAP enhances chromatin accessibility and activates the EGFR signaling pathway, whereas LIP exerts minimal effects on TNBC phenotypes.

Modern flexible endoscopy was introduced to the Solomon Islands National Referral Hospital (NRH) in 2012, but little is known about gastrointestinal disease in the country.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study describes trends in upper gastrointestinal diseases to inform local research and health programming. Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic data, including rapid urease test (RUT) results for H. pylori, were abstracted from consecutively entered patient medical records at the NRH.ResultsA total of 761 patients underwent upper endoscopy and RUT (2019-2022). Although RUT was positive in only 25.8% of patients (N = 196), relatively common findings of erosions (N = 90, 11.8%) and ulcers (N = 89, 11.7%), as well as frequently reported symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (N = 168, 22.1%), suggest a higher true prevalence of H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease in this cohort. Age was associated with an endoscopic finding of ulcers on univariate analysis. Multivariable modeling indicated a significant association between the presence of gastric erythema and erosions and the diagnosis of duodenitis. Multivariable regression also showed symptoms of melena and hematemesis to be significantly associated with the endoscopic finding of ulcers. Among patients treated for H. pylori who underwent follow-up endoscopy and RUT, 28.8% failed treatment.ConclusionThere was a high degree of concern regarding gastrointestinal symptomology and pathology in this cohort. Access to endoscopy and RUT in Solomon Islands remains limited to a single endoscopy unit. Future efforts should explore non-invasive clinical pathways for the expansion of RUT and the management of ulcer disease in Solomon Islands.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we explore infrastructures-human, epistemic, and material-that enable the creation of maps and the stories they tell about the world. We develop the concept of 'cartographic infrastructures' to reveal the hidden and fragile political, scientific, and social worlds that undergird the production of maps and the truths they bring into being. To illustrate this, we examine a series of highly influential maps published in the early 1960s by Denis Burkitt-a colonial doctor working in British East Africa-showing the geographical distribution of a pediatric tumour in Africa. By correlating the tumour with altitude and rainfall, the maps suggested it had a viral origin, a finding that profoundly affected cancer research and helped accelerate the development of viral oncology. Using reports, diaries, and photos left behind by Burkitt and others, we excavate the cartographic infrastructures that underpinned his maps and viral hypothesis. First, we examine how the research tradition of geographical pathology-with its focus on environmental factors in carcinogenesis and its interest in Africa as a laboratory for cancer research-provided Burkitt with the theories, networks, and funding necessary to conduct his work. Second, we examine the surveillance practices, ranging from tumour safaris to geographical plotting, that enabled Burkitt to generate and interpret the data underlying his maps. Third, we analyze the communities of white colonial medical officers and missionary doctors spread across Africa with their shared imaginaries of race, empire, and adventure on which Burkitt relied to conduct his surveys.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a prevalent complication of thoracic tumor radiotherapy, severely compromising treatment efficacy and the patients' quality of life, yet effective prevention or treatment strategies remain elusive. Folic acid (FA), a water-soluble vitamin, plays critical roles in DNA synthesis/repair, cell cycle regulation, epigenetic regulation via methylation, oxidative stress response, and embryonic development. However, its radioprotective role has not been systematically elucidated. This study aimed to investigate its effects and molecular mechanisms during RILI. The RILI murine model showed that folic acid supplementation significantly alleviated radiation-induced lung tissue damage, body weight loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Meanwhile, folic acid mitigated radiation-induced DNA damage and cellular senescence in lung tissues and lung epithelial cell lines. RNA sequencing identified a 29-gene SASP signature (including CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10), which was significantly suppressed by folic acid in irradiated lungs. Moreover, folic acid inhibited SASP production by suppressing the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. By integrating in vivo and in vitro models, we revealed that folic acid exerts its radioprotective effects by reducing cellular senescence and the production of SASP. Taken together, these findings indicated that folic acid is potentially a novel therapeutic strategy for RILI.",

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials have demonstrated that chemotherapy contributes to prolonged survival in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Currently, cytotoxic agents with established efficacy for previously treated AGC include paclitaxel (PTX), irinotecan (IRI), and trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), while the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) agent ramucirumab (RAM) has also shown efficacy. Pembrolizumab is indicated for AGC with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or high tumor mutational burden (TMB). For human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive previously treated AGC, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has emerged as the first molecular targeted therapy. Additionally, claudin-18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)-targeting antibody therapy has been established as a first-line treatment, with numerous ongoing clinical trials in later-line settings. Other promising molecular targets include trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 1(CAPRIN-1), and KRAS. Furthermore, innovative therapeutic approaches such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy are being developed. This review summarizes the historical and established evidence from clinical trials on previously treated AGC and discusses ongoing clinical trials and future perspectives in treatment development, with a focus on targeted therapies. Biomarker-driven treatment is expected to become the mainstream approach in the future.",

    "title": "Factors Influencing Hormone Remission in Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors With Residual Tumor: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Growth hormone-secreting pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (GH-secreting PitNETs) pose significant health risks due to hormone-related complications. Despite transsphenoidal surgical resection being the primary treatment, complete removal is often infeasible due to invasive growth patterns, leading to postoperative tumor residuals and uncertain hormone remission outcomes. This retrospective study included 458 patients with GH-secreting PitNETs who underwent surgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Data on preoperative hormone levels, MRI scans, and histopathological features were analyzed. Tumor segmentation, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) scores, and subcluster clustering based on MRI data were computed using radiomic features, while multivariate analyses determined factors influencing hormone remission. Single-cell data from four GH-type pituitary adenomas were collected from public databases to explore ITH in GH1 gene expression. Postoperative hormone remission was achieved in 61 of 144 patients (42.4%) with residual tumors. Univariate analysis demonstrated that in cases with tumor residuals, preoperative hormone levels, tumor resection rates, residual tumor volume, tumor residual location, residual-tumor proximity to the internal carotid artery, and MRI-based tumor heterogeneity were associated with hormone remission. Among these factors, preoperative hormone levels (10-30 ng/mL vs. ≤ 10 ng/mL: OR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.20-1.19, p = 0.115; > 30 ng/mL vs. ≤ 10 ng/mL: OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.36, p < 0.001), tumor resection rate (OR: 18.29, 95% CI: 2.08-160.97, p = 0.009), and tumor heterogeneity as measured by the ITH score (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.12, p = 0.042) were independent predictors of hormone remission in cases with residual tumors. Moreover, single-cell data showing highly variable GH1 expression within the same patient reveal ITH in hormone expression. Preoperative GH levels, tumor resection rates, and ITH scores independently predict hormone remission in GH-secreting PitNETs with residuals. This will provide intraoperative decision-making guidance on how to achieve the maximum possible hormone remission with residual tumors when complete tumor resection is not feasible.",

The gut microbiota is associated with patient outcome and toxicity from cancer therapy, although limited data are available for breast cancer. In the randomized phase 2b trial ICON, immunomodulating chemotherapy was investigated in combination with dual ICB in HR+ mBC. To determine whether gut microbiota could inform prognosis, we performed 16S (V3-V4) rRNA sequencing on fecal samples collected at baseline and after 8 weeks of study treatment. We showed that high alpha diversity before treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; primary trial endpoint) and overall survival. Alpha diversity was lower in patients with prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. However, alpha diversity remained significantly associated with PFS after correcting for prior chemotherapy and other factors in bivariate analyses. High-grade immune-related toxicity was also associated with high alpha diversity. These findings suggest that high alpha diversity should be further investigated as a positive prognostic factor in HR+ mBC and approaches to increase alpha diversity could potentially improve clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding the RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15 (FET proteins) are involved in chromosomal translocations in rare sarcomas. The encoded fusion oncoproteins typically include a DNA binding domain and function as oncogenic transcription factors. FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting patients of all ages. Oncogenic fusion TFs are challenging to target directly and new therapies are needed. Treatment with the small molecule SP-2509 results in reversal of the transcriptional activity of the FET fusion that causes Ewing sarcoma, EWSR1::FLI1. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649), but its pharmacological activity in FET fusion positive sarcomas has not been demonstrated. We found potent seclidemstat cytotoxicity against both FET-rearranged and other fusion-positive sarcoma cell lines in vitro, including Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma. We also define transcriptomic effects of seclidemstat with bulk RNA-seq. Seclidemstat recapitulated much of SP-2509 transcriptional activity in Ewing sarcoma. Widespread transcriptional changes were seen in all tested cell lines after seclidemstat treatment, regardless of the fusion protein expressed. This included reversal of FET-fusion transcriptional signatures for EWSR1::WT1, EWSR1::ATF1, and EWSR1::ERG. Though novel inhibitors are unlikely to display single-agent efficacy in the clinic, these data suggest seclidemstat remains a promising new treatment strategy for patients with FET-rearranged and other fusion positive sarcomas.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 antibody, have significantly changed the treatment landscape not only for unresectable melanoma but also for non-melanoma skin cancers. In addition, anti-PD-1 antibody administration methods have evolved and are now used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. As these treatment strategies have been evaluated, it has become clear that understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to the success of anti-PD-1 antibody-based immunotherapy. For example, racial differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy in melanoma are influenced not only by tumor-related factors such as tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, but also by components of the TME, including tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), all of which can affect the therapeutic outcome of ICIs. Furthermore, studies conducted during the development of neoadjuvant therapies have shown that tumor-reactive TILs are densely localized within primary tumors and are closely associated with both treatment efficacy and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic efficacy of currently available anti-PD-1 antibody-based immunotherapies for skin cancer and examine the role of the TME in influencing these therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Oral mucositis (OM) presents a common and debilitating side effect of chemotherapy for children and young people (CYP). Photobiomodulation is recommended for OM prevention in international guidance; however, the acceptability of photobiomodulation in paediatric cancer care is uncertain. This study explores this acceptability with CYP, their parents, and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Semi-structured interviews with CYP/parent dyads and focus groups with HCPs were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Framework analysis was completed utilising the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) using an initial deductive approach for theoretical rigour. Over-arching themes within and between constructs and participant groups were developed. Recruitment occurred alongside analysis until there was repetition of data and an absence of novel codes. Twenty-seven participants were interviewed. CYP were aged 8-15 years old; HCPs had diverse professional roles within paediatric oncology and dentistry. Over half of families and three quarters of HCPs had previous photobiomodulation experience. Data were coded for all seven TFA constructs. Four themes, consisting of multiple subthemes, were developed from 42 distinct codes: (i) positive attitudes towards photobiomodulation; (ii) importance of child-centredness and autonomy; (iii) lack of understanding of photobiomodulation treatment; (iv) perceived additional burden to healthcare teams. Photobiomodulation for OM prevention is acceptable to CYP, their parents, and HCPs during cancer treatment. Exploration of the theoretical facets of this acceptability supports adaptation of services to overcome highlighted challenges to photobiomodulation acceptance. Photobiomodulation services should be designed to reduce burden on healthcare services, with resources developed to support CYP's autonomy, comprehension and self-efficacy with intra-oral treatment.",

This study compared immune responses to standard versus intensified pneumococcal vaccination strategies in IBD patients receiving anti-TNF (±immunosuppressors) or vedolizumab. In a prospective, multicenter, randomized open-label study across 7 French university hospitals, IBD patients in clinical remission on biologic therapy (anti-TNF ± immunosuppressors, or vedolizumab) were randomized 1:1 to an intensified (PCV13/PCV13/PPSV23) or standard (PCV13/PPSV23) regimen.

One hundred and four patients (median age, 43 years; 60.6% male; 68.3% Crohn's disease) were randomized to the standard (n = 51) or intensified (n = 53) regimen. At M5, the vaccine response was significantly higher in the intensified group compared to the standard group, as measured by ELISA (53.2% vs. 27.1%; relative risk [RR[ = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.15-3.36; P = .009) and OPA (90.9% vs. 62.5%; P = .007). OPA responses remained higher in the intensified group at M12, M18, and M36. Reduced responses were associated with anti-TNF therapy, combination therapy, and Crohn's disease.

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice for canine intracranial gliomas. Recently, modern advanced radiation techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), have become widely available in veterinary medicine. However, the glioma-specific therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with modern RT remain unclear. This study aimed to describe survival outcomes and tumour response and to identify whether any treatment, clinical, and imaging factors were predictive of prognosis in dogs with intracranial gliomas treated with definitive-intent IMRT alone. Medical records of dogs with presumed intracranial gliomas that underwent definitive-intent IMRT were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-five dogs were included. Amongst them, 29 and 26 underwent fractionated RT (FRT) and stereotactic RT (SRT), respectively. In the 44 dogs that underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the overall measurable response rate was 77.3%. Clinical improvement was observed in 92% of the dogs. Local tumour regrowth and drop metastases were observed in 17 (30.9%) and 10 dogs (18.2%), respectively. The median overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 432, 670, and 441 days, respectively. Seven dogs (12.7%) died during RT or within 6 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival times between FRT and SRT. In the multivariate analysis, poor performance status, tumour location in the diencephalon, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery heterogeneity were significantly associated with shorter survival times. These findings suggest that definitive-intent RT results in tumour shrinkage and prolonged survival (432 days) with minimal radiation toxicity regardless of the RT protocol used. Performance status and MRI findings can be useful for predicting prognosis.",

However, optimizing mitochondria-targeted gene delivery to promote RGC regeneration and visual-photoreception recovery remains challenging in LHON. Here, mitochondria-targeted wireless charging gold nanoparticles (WCGs), doubling as a wireless charging-mediated gene-delivery platform and electric stimulus-restored phototransduction, are developed for LHON treatment. Upon high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) irradiation, WCGs enhanced MT-ND4 transfection efficiency, restored complex I activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in vitro, and further promoted RGC neurite outgrowth in LHON patient-derived iPSC-differentiated retinal organoids. Wireless charging combined with electric stimulation also facilitated in vivo gene delivery, effectively promoting neuronal recovery, preventing RGC degeneration, suppressing inflammation, and enhancing retinal electrophysiological function in the damaged retinas of LHON mice. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis revealed that HFMF-treatment reprograms Müller glia to enhance dendritic development, restore mitochondrial function, and express phototransduction genes to support photoreceptor function in vivo. Finally, functional retinal-optic-electrophysiological findings with spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level support that HFMF synergized with WCG/hND4 therapy, promoting retinal repairment with RGC neurite regeneration and recovering visual phototransduction in LHON mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a prototypical per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), is widely used in industrial and consumer products but is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC due to its environmental persistence and bioaccumulation. PFOA primarily targets the liver, inducing stress responses and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, while promoting hepatoma cell proliferation through the mTOR pathway. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of PFOA-induced liver cancer (LIHC), we will use a network toxicology approach that integrates multi-omics data to construct a compound-target-disease network, focusing on potential targets like ALDH1B1, which encodes the aldehyde dehydrogenase family in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism. It is hypothesized that hepatic metabolic homeostasis is disrupted and hepatocellular carcinogenesis is ultimately promoted by PFOA through direct binding to ALDH1B1 and interference with its function. To confirm this, we will employ molecular docking and dynamics simulations to validate the binding interactions and toxicity mechanisms at the molecular level. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of PFOA's hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity while identifying potential targets for risk assessment and intervention strategies related to environmental exposure.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThis retrospective study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes, safety profiles, and postoperative recovery characteristics of conventional open surgery, ultrasound-guided minimally invasive rotary cutting, and microwave ablation in the treatment of benign breast tumors, using historical patient data.MethodsIn total, 164 patients with benign breast tumors treated at Haidian Hospital, Beijing, from January 2020 to January 2023 were selected as study participants. Based on the treatment received by the patients, they were divided into three groups: open surgery group (87 patients treated with conventional open excision surgery), rotary cutting group (65 patients treated with Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance), and ablation group (12 patients treated with microwave ablation). Subsequently, key indicators, including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, postoperative pain score, incidence of postoperative complications, and aesthetic outcome of the breast, were comprehensively compared and analyzed among the three groups.ResultsStatistical analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) among the groups in terms of operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, incision healing time, and postoperative pain scores at 24, 48, and 72 h. Specifically, the ablation group showed significantly lower values for these parameters compared with the rotary cutting and open surgery groups. The rotary cutting group exhibited better outcomes than the open surgery group across these metrics. In addition, the incidence of postoperative complications and aesthetic outcome of the breast in the ablation and rotary cutting groups were significantly better than those in the open surgery group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications and the aesthetic outcome of the breast between the ablation and rotary cutting groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionCompared with conventional open surgery, microwave ablation and Micromotion minimally invasive rotary cutting under color Doppler ultrasound guidance demonstrate superior surgical outcomes, lower postoperative pain levels, and reduced incidence of postoperative complications in the treatment of benign breast tumors. Microwave ablation offers shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, faster postoperative recovery, and significantly greater pain relief while providing better aesthetic outcome of the breast.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate patients' global impression (PGI), patient pain goal (PPG), achievement of a patient pain goal response (PPGR) among individuals with advanced cancer admitted to an acute palliative care unit (APCU), after a BTP medication. Longitudinal design was employed to assess 230 patients. Changes in BTP, PGI, PPG and PPGR were measured. BTP intensity (mean, SD) before administration of a BTP medication (T0), 15 min after (T15) and 30 min after (T30) was 6.5 (1.63), 4.3 (1.5) and 2.3 (1.5), respectively. The mean PPG was 1.61 (SD 1.6). Almost all patients reported an improvement in PGI. There were no differences between the different opioids used as BTP medication, and PGGR and PGI (p = 0.728 and p = 0.442, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, higher pain intensity at T0 and lower pain intensity at T30 were independently related to PGI (p < 0.0005). The number of patients who achieved their goals increased at T30 (46.1%); 90.8% of patients reported an improvement in PGI; PPGR was correlated with PPG both at T15 and T30 (p < 0.0005) and was inversely correlated with pain intensity at T15' (p = 0.001) and T30' (p < 0.0005). PPG enables clinicians to individualise patient care and facilitates the assessment of pain response within the same patient over time, ensuring that the evaluation is both clinically relevant and meaningful. Together, the PPG, PGI and PPGR serve as important patient-centred metrics which support pain assessment and inform clinical decision-making in alignment with patients' expectations. Patient expectations, expressed as pain goals, are hard to be achieved. Nevertheless, global impression after a breakthrough medication is good, regardless the opioid used.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a challenging disease to treat due to the limitations of conventional therapies, including toxicity to healthy cells and drug resistance. This underscores the need for alternative treatment modalities to target tumors more effectively while minimizing side effects. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as promising agents in the realm of cancer therapy, particularly through magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), which employs MNPs to generate localized heat in tumor tissues using an alternating magnetic field (AMF), while sparing healthy cells. This present study focused on the synthesis of self-regulating, temperature-controlled, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-coated manganese-zinc ferrite nanoparticle-based magnetic fluid (MF) to enhance the biocompatibility of MF and its therapeutic efficacy. The biocompatibility and cellular uptake of the synthesized MF were investigated by using the MTT assay and Prussian blue staining. Quantitative assessment of the internalization of MNPs was carried out using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The study further analyzed the immediate and 24 h delayed cytotoxic effects of MFH on breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and noncancerous murine fibroblasts (McCoy). The mode of cell death induced immediately and after 24 h post-MFH was examined using Hoechst/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Both MCF-7 and McCoy cells exhibited favorable biocompatibility and substantial internalization of MF, with a significant induction of apoptosis after MFH. A 24 h incubation period post-MFH enabled cells to transition from early- to late-stage apoptosis in both cell lines, resulting in nearly complete cell death. This research establishes a foundational framework for investigating the application of PAA-coated biocompatible MNPs, with the goal of further exploring their use in breast cancer spheroids and/or in vivo animal models to develop MFH-based cancer treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity, otherwise referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), is defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions and has been linked to an increased risk of depression in many parts of the world. Disadvantaged social identities potentially play an important role in shaping this association. However, these associations are poorly understood in situations of multiple disadvantaged social identities, especially among Black populations in the United States of America. This study examined the association between multimorbidity and depression severity among Black populations in the United States using the intersectionality approach. This study utilized IPUMS-NHIS datasets from 2009 to 2019. A weighted sample of 5,745 respondents aged 18 years and above was extracted from the data and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models. The study found that although multimorbid individuals had a higher risk of severe depression (RRR = 1.93; p < 0.001; 95% CI:1.58-2.35), there are variations by individual's social identities. The risk was higher among Black Americans (RRR = 2.40; p < 0.001; 95% C.I = 1.89-3.07) with MCCs compared to Black immigrants; and among females (RRR = 2.73; p < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.11-3.54) and unemployed (RRR = 2.69; p < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.07-3.51) compared to their male and employed counterparts, respectively. Those with multiple disadvantaged social identities yet had MCCs, especially, unemployed Black American females (RRR = 3.43; p < 0.001; 95% C.I = 2.54-4.63) and males who were unemployed (RRR = 2.02; p < 0.05; 95% C.I = 1.42-2.87) had elevated risk of experiencing severe depression compared to those who had no MCCs and Black immigrants. The findings suggest the need to focus attention on the complex effects of multiple disadvantaged social identities in shaping mental health outcomes, particularly among individuals experiencing chronic health conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of fibrin glue application in reducing bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the general patient population. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 262 patients who underwent ESD for gastric neoplasms. The participants were randomized into the fibrin glue group (n=133) or the control group (n=129). The primary outcome was the post-ESD bleeding rate, which was compared between the two groups. Additionally, exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted for high-risk patients, which included patients taking antithrombotic agents (ATAs) and patients with resected specimens measuring 4 cm or greater. In the modified intention-to-treat population (n=252), the overall bleeding rate occurred in 10.7% of cases, including 10.3% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 11.1% of patients in the control group (p=0.839). In the per-protocol population (n=248), the bleeding rates were 10.3% in the fibrin glue group and 10.7% in the control group (p=1.000). Among ATA users, the overall bleeding rate was 18.0%, including 9.5% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 24.1% of patients in the control group (p=0.271). Among ATA users with specimens measuring 4 cm or larger, the overall bleeding rate was 18.4%, including 12.5% of patients in the fibrin glue group and 22.7% of patients in the control group (p=0.675). Routine application of fibrin glue after ESD did not significantly reduce postoperative bleeding. Although the results of subgroup analyses suggested a potential reduction in early bleeding among high-risk patients, these findings warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS-2) is a rare congenital immune dysfunction characterized by partial albinism and recurrent episodes of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It is caused by a variant in the gene encoding Rab27a leading to a degranulation defect in melanocytes, natural killer (NK)- and T cells. Prognosis of patients with GS-2 is limited by repetitive episodes of life-threatening HLH with onset in early childhood. The only curative treatment is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Here, we report on an 18 year old female patient with a homozygous missense p.Arg50Glnfs*35 variant in exon 2 of RAB27A who presented with an exceptionally late onset of severe HLH. Her phenotypically inapparent albinism complicated to correctly diagnose GS-2. Immune function assays confirmed a T- and NK cell degranulation deficiency characteristic for patients with primary HLH, while microscopic hair analysis revealed melanin clumps secondary to melanocyte functional impairment. To understand why disease onset occurred unusually late in this patient, we investigated the patient's T cell and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) function in more detail. We could show that intracellular granzyme B storage in cytotoxic T cells was increased compared to healthy donors and that the patient's T cells maintained some degranulation activity. Both, antigen-specific cytotoxic response and proliferation capacity of the patient's T cells were preserved. We demonstrate for the first time that also PMN degranulation, assessed as stimulation-induced CD66b and CD11b cell membrane expression, is dysfunctional in patients with Rab27a deficiency-associated primary HLH. The patient was treated with steroids and cyclosporine A for immunosuppression to control the HLH. After two severe episodes within only a few months, she eventually received an allogeneic HSCT and has not experienced further HLH episodes for now more than 3 years after the HSCT procedure. This case should raise awareness for the possibility of initial manifestation of primary, genetically-determined HLH even in adult patients.",

    "abstract": "Immunonutrition is a part of nutritional interventions in gastrointestinal cancer patients. It seems to be especially important in the preoperative period to reduce, among others, surgery-related complications. The relation between the immune system and gut microbiota has been previously analyzed. However, the influence of immunonutrients on the composition of gut microbiota is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of enteral immunonutrition on gut microbiota in gastric/colorectal cancer patients in the preoperative period. This study included 14 patients (n = 9 colorectal cancer, n = 5 gastric cancer) allocated to receive immunonutrition or standard products by 7 days prior to the surgery. Randomization was performed using a random number generator. The stool samples were collected at day 0 and after 7 days of consuming the study products. Therefore, gut microbiota analysis was conducted at the beginning and after 7 days (follow-up). The analysis consists of alpha diversity analysis, taxonomic data processing, beta diversity analysis, and differential abundance analysis. Statistical analysis did not indicate any significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two dietary groups for any of the alpha diversity indices. Microbial community compositions were largely similar between the immunodiet and standard nutridrink groups. Differential abundance analysis (DAA) using the Wilcoxon test identified several taxa with nominal p-values <0.05, suggesting potential differences in abundance between groups. However, none of these findings remained statistically significant. The taxa with nominal significance included Bilophila, CAG-56, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Coprobacter, Holdemania, Fusicatenibacter, Ruminococcus, and [Eubacterium] eligens group. The analysis of gut microbiota in the context of immunonutrition is a new area in oncology. In the current study, despite some initial microbial alterations, it was not finally confirmed that immunonutrition has a beneficial effect on gut microbiota in gastric and colorectal cancer patients in the preoperative period. However, the small sample size is one of the study's limitations.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by pronounced invasiveness, rapid progression, frequent recurrence, and poor clinical prognosis. Current treatment strategies remain inadequate due to the lack of effective molecular targets, underscoring the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic avenues. In this study, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis and meta-analysis, incorporating clinical immunotherapy datasets, to identify ten candidate genes associated with GBM initiation, progression, prognosis, and response to immunotherapy. Multi-omics analyses across glioma and pan-cancer datasets revealed that these genes play pivotal roles in cancer biology. Phospholipase Cb4 (PLCB4) showed a negative correlation with tumor grade in clinical samples, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Evidence indicated that PLCB4 expression is modulated by Wnt signaling, and its overexpression may activate the calcium ion signaling pathway. Notably, PLCB4 is strongly associated with aberrant tumor proliferation, making it a compelling therapeutic target. Through structure-based virtual screening, five small molecules with high predicted affinity for PLCB4 were identified as potential drug candidates. This study's integrative approach-combining target identification, pathway inference, and in silico drug screening-offers a promising framework for rational drug development in GBM. The findings may reduce unnecessary experimental screening and medical costs, and represent a significant step toward improving therapeutic outcomes and prognosis for GBM patients.",

    "title": "Deciphering the mechanistic roles of ADARs in cancer pathogenesis, tumor immune evasion, and drug resistance.",
    "abstract": "RNA is a fundamental biological macromolecule that undergoes several post-transcriptional modifications, including adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). These essential enzymes catalyze the conversion of A-to-I in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, influencing RNA stability, splicing, and translation, all of which impact various cellular functions. More recently, RNA editing has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in cancer biology, where ADARs, primarily ADAR1 and ADAR2, exert context-dependent roles as either oncogenic drivers or tumor suppressors. Beyond their catalytic editing function, ADARs also regulate cancer-relevant pathways through editing-independent mechanisms, including RNA binding and protein-protein interactions. Dysregulated ADAR activity facilitates carcinogenesis by altering oncogene expression, impairing tumor suppressor pathways, and reprogramming the transcriptome to promote tumor progression. Furthermore, RNA editing may contribute to tumor cell immune evasion by affecting interferon signaling and altering neoantigen presentation, as well as modulating immune surveillance. Additionally, ADAR-mediated RNA modifications contribute to therapy resistance by modifying drug targets and pathways involved in cell survival and repair. This review comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted roles of RNA-editing ADAR enzymes in cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing editing-dependent and -independent mechanisms contributing to tumor progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Moreover, we highlight the potential of ADARs as prognostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets in oncology. This review aims to spark novel precision oncology and cancer immunotherapy strategies by bridging molecular insights with translational applications.",

We evaluated whether ctDNA-directed stratification could optimize locoregional control in HNSCC patients following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. In this comparative cohort study, consecutive HNSCC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were stratified into two management groups: a ctDNA-guided cohort where tumor-informed ctDNA testing determined POCRT administration given only for detectable ctDNA, and a traditional cohort where all patients received PORT, with postoperative chemotherapy decisions made by multidisciplinary team review based on pathologic response status and pretreatment imaging findings. The primary endpoint was 3-year locoregional control, with secondary analysis of POCRT utilization rates. Among 257 patients who completed neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, 209 (81.3%) underwent surgery with 187 (72.8% of treated patients) achieving major pathological response and comprising our study population. Of these, 69 (36.9%) received ctDNA-guided management, while 118 (63.1%) followed traditional protocols. POCRT utilization was significantly lower in the ctDNA-guided group (27.5% [19/69] vs 42.4% [50/118]; absolute difference -14.9%, p=0.042). ctDNA positivity rates were comparable between groups (ctDNA-guided: 27.5% [19/69] vs traditional: 29.6% [35/118], p=0.867). ctDNA-guided management demonstrated superior outcomes, with a 15% reduction in locoregional recurrence risk (adjusted HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-0.94; p=0.013) versus traditional management. Among ctDNA-positive patients, POCRT benefit was significantly greater in the ctDNA-guided cohort (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.57-0.83; p=0.026) compared to ctDNA-positive patients receiving traditional management (HR 0.87, 95%CI 0.73-0.93; p=0.047; interaction p=0.039). Postoperative ctDNA analysis identifies HNSCC patients who benefit most from POCRT, enabling a 41% relative reduction in treatment utilization while maintaining superior locoregional control. The enhanced therapeutic effect observed in ctDNA-guided patients supports ctDNA's role as a decision-modifying biomarker for personalization management following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.",

NK cells can eliminate tumor cells through various mechanisms. Genetic engineering of NK cells can enhance their activation signals, promote proliferation, inhibit suppressive signals, and improve tumor homing, all of which are expected to significantly boost their clinical efficacy. Compared to chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, NK cell-based immunotherapy demonstrates superior safety and tolerability. However, the clinical application of NK cells still faces several challenges, including suboptimal expansion efficiency in vitro, limited persistence in vivo, low transduction efficiency of chimeric antigen receptor NK (CAR-NK) cells, and immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment. These issues require further investigation to achieve significant improvements.

A cancer in which local treatment of liver metastases is particularly important is colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of brachytherapy of liver metastases of colorectal cancer. The analysis included 270 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated between 2015 and 2022. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to indications for treatment: patients with repeat oligoprogression, induced oligoprogression and induced oligopersistence. Patients were analysed in terms of PFS and OS depending on epidemiological factors such as age and gender and clinical factors such as tumour location, type of metastases, stage, LVSI, degree of malignancy, location of extrahepatic lesions, size of metastases, number of metastases, treatment intention and dose. The degree of response to treatment and its toxicity were assessed. During an average follow-up period of 16 months, the median PFS was 10 months and the OS was 17 months. 6m-, 12m-24m-PFS were 79%, 42% and 2%, respectively. and 6m-, 12m- and 24m-OS were 99%, 74% and 22%, respectively.

The most important factors that influenced the prognosis were the intention of treatment, the degree of response to treatment, the dose administered, the presence of extrahepatic metastases, and the degree of malignancy. The toxicity of the treatment was low, and the most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Brachytherapy is an effective and safe method of local treatment of liver metastases and should be considered especially in patients with a limited number of metastases who do not qualify for surgical treatment and the size of the metastases prevents the use of stereotactic radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Identification of CD8+ T cell epitopes is crucial for advancing vaccine development and immunotherapy strategies. Traditional methods for predicting T cell epitopes primarily focus on MHC presentation, leveraging immunopeptidome data. Recent advancements however suggest significant performance improvements through transfer learning and refinement using epitope data. To further investigate this, we here develop an enhanced MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation predictor by integrating newly curated binding affinity and eluted ligand datasets, expanding MHC allele coverage, and incorporating novel input features related to the structural constraints of the MHC-I peptide-binding cleft. We next apply transfer learning using experimentally validated pathogen- and cancer-derived epitopes from public databases to refine our prediction method, ensuring comprehensive data partitioning to prevent performance overestimation. Integration of structural features results in improved predictive power and enhanced identification of peptide residues likely to interact with the MHC. However, our findings indicate that fine-tuning on epitope data only yields a minor accuracy boost. Moreover, the transferability between cancer and pathogen-derived epitopes is limited, suggesting distinct properties between these data types. In conclusion, while transfer learning can enhance T cell epitope prediction, the performance gains are modest and data type specific.

    "abstract": "The plethora of advancements in cancer treatment has resulted in designing unique signatures and personalized therapies, tailored to patient-specific needs, using medications that target specific markers on cancer cells or even retrain the body's immune system. Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, also called as CAR T-cell, is one such approach wherein a patient's cells are modulated to kill the cancer cells. Conventional cancer treatments invite issues like low specificity, increased chances of relapse, or issues with radiotoxicity and tolerance in the case of chemotherapy. Currently, CAR T-cell therapy is under clinical investigation, and different countries are still coming up with their guidelines for the pragmatic application of CAR T. In this review, we present all one needs to know about CAR T-cell therapy, its types, components, side effects, current authorization status in different countries, along with the technology being used in the therapy. We also briefly upon the recent regulations or guidelines released by Europe and the USA, the countries that have actively initiated the CAR T idea. This review aims to provide insight into this targeted therapy, which has the potential to boost cancer research and to help researchers develop more such patient-specific treatments to improve clinical outcomes in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Although there have been some reports of oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) in patients with hematologic neoplasms, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report this lesion affecting a patient with polycythemia vera. A 54-year-old male patient diagnosed with polycythemia vera presented with non-removable white patches with a rough surface on the bilateral border of the tongue. According to clinical, histopathological and in situ hybridization features, OHL was established. Two months after diagnosis, the patient developed splenomegaly and initiated ruxolitinib. Bone marrow biopsy showed post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis. The patient underwent allogeneic haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, achieving complete remission of the oral lesion. OHL is an important marker of immunosuppression. In the present case, OHL was diagnosed during the progression of polycythemia vera to myelofibrosis and its early diagnosis may have contributed to a better clinical outcome.",

    "title": "The Effects of Released Exosomes from NK-92 Cells with IL15 on the Apoptosis of HL-60 Cell Line.",
    "abstract": "Background: Most cancers are treated through chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these methods have limitations due to cancer cells evading immune detection, prompting researchers to explore alternatives such as immunotherapy. Nonetheless, cancer cells can weaken the immune response, necessitating improvements in immunotherapy methods. Exosomes, tiny cell-derived nanoparticles, reflect the traits of their originating cells. Natural Killer NK cells produce exosomes comprising perforin, granzyme, Fas-L, etc. The small size, proximity to tumors, and stability of these exosomes enable easy absorption by cancer cells. This study demonstrates that IL-15 impacts NK-derived exosomes, enhancing their ability to kill cancer cells. Materials and Methods: With the addition of 100 nanograms per milliliter of IL-15 to NK-92 cell culture, the cells are incubated for 48 hours. Exosomes are then isolated from treated and non-treated NK-92 cell lines through the ultracentrifuge method. After isolation, different concentrations of exosomes from both groups are added to HL-60 cells for treatment. After 24 hours, the apoptosis rate is assessed through the Annexin-V method. Results: Increased light absorption in the BCA test, along with thicker bands of CD63 and CD81 in the Western blotting test, indicates a higher yield of exosomes after adding IL-15 to the source cells. The low p-value from the t-test demonstrates that exosomes derived from stimulated NK cells are more cytotoxic than those from the control group. Further, two-way ANOVA confirms differences between the control and treatment groups at each concentration, and Welch's t-test proves that all differences in the ANOVA test are significant. Conclusion: This article presents evidence that exosomes obtained from IL-15-induced NK cells not only increase in quantity but also demonstrate significant cytotoxicity against leukemic cells compared to exosomes obtained from non-stimulated NK cells.",

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 127 newly diagnosed non-M3 acute myeloblastic leukemia (non-M3 AML) patients. We investigated pre-treatment levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Albumin, and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) with cytogenetics, response to induction therapy, recurrence, and overall survival. Results: We did not find any relationship between levels of CRP, Albumin, and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) with complete remission rate, recurrence, and risk categorization of patients (P > 0.05). 3-and 5- year overall survival was 40.8% (with a standard error of 4.7%) and 30.1% (standard error: 5.3%), respectively. In addition, 3-year and 5-year event-free survival was 31.3% (standard error = 4.4%) and 25.8% (standard error = 4.8%), respectively. The only prognostic factor was allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Conclusion: Although CRP, Albumin, and CAR serve as convenient prognostic markers, they were not predictive of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in AML patients.

This study investigates the RTW rate among colorectal cancer patients post-surgery. Materials and Methods: Colorectal cancer patients referred to the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences oncology clinics were enrolled based on inclusion criteria and after obtaining oral consent. Each participant completed a checklist and a questionnaire on the quality of working life for colorectal cancer patients. The checklist included age, gender, insurance type, annual income, marital status, occupation, hospitalization duration, medical history, occupational profile, health status, and disease stage. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: A total of 57 patients were included, with 54 (94.7%) males. Forty-four patients (77.2%) returned to work in their previous or new roles. Among these, 27 (47.4%) worked full-time, 17 (29.8%) part-time, and 13 (22.8%) did not RTW. No significant relationship was found between RTW and factors such as age (p=0.116), gender (p=0.547), residence (p=0.333), insurance type (p=0.083), job type (p=0.526), history of chronic diseases (p=0.432), or cancer treatment method (p>0.999). However, significant correlations were observed between RTW and the quality of life questionnaire score (p=0.001), length of hospitalization (p=0.041), and annual income (p<0.001). Conclusion: Approximately 77% of colorectal cancer patients returned to work following treatment. Shorter hospital stays and higher income were associated with greater RTW rates. Additionally, the quality of working life questionnaire score was strongly correlated with RTW (p=0.001).",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat many cancers, and their sensitivity to radiation is crucial for favorable outcomes. This study investigated whether the immediate early response 5 (IER5) protein affects Cdc25B protein expression in HeLa cells after gamma irradiation. IER5 was knocked down using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells irradiated with 2 or 4 Gy of gamma rays. The mRNA and protein expression levels were subsequently determined via qRT-PCR and western blotting. The distribution of cells during the cell cycle was also determined using flow cytometry. IER5 protein levels were successfully reduced with RNAi. Variations in IER5 levels led to differences in Cdc25B mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, IER5 affected the proportion of cells in the G2 phase, which is regulated mainly by Cdc25B. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted on the expression levels of IER5 and Cdc25B in HeLa cells and the IER5-silenced HeLa (siIER5-HeLa) cell line at various time points after exposure to 4 Gy of gamma rays, and a negative correlation was detected between IER5 and Cdc25B expression levels, with correlation coefficients of -0.686 and -0.663, respectively. Additionally, variations in IER5 levels led to differences in the expression levels of p53, NF-YB, and p300, which may be putative transcriptional regulators of Cdc25B. These results suggest that IER5 plays a negative role in regulating Cdc25B expression, which may involve interactions with the transcriptional regulators p53, NF-YB, and p300.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma attributable to alcohol use (NPC-AU) contributes substantially to global cancer mortality and disability, yet its temporal and geographic patterns remain incompletely described. To assess the global, regional, and national burden of NPC-AU from 1990 to 2021 and project trends through 2040. Using GBD 2021 data, global, regional, and national age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life-years rates (ASDR) attributable to alcohol were evaluated. Trends were quantified by average annual percentage change (AAPC) and projections were generated using Bayesian age-period-cohort models. From 1990 to 2021, global ASMR declined from 0.31 to 0.19 per 100,000 population (AAPC -1.66; 95% CI -1.79 to -1.52) and ASDR fell with an AAPC of -1.72 (95% CI -1.87 to -1.57). Male ASMR decreased from 0.42 to 0.27 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.60), and female ASMR from 0.21 to 0.12 per 100,000 (AAPC -2.25). High-middle SDI regions saw ASMR drop from 0.50 to 0.28 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.97), whereas low-middle SDI regions experienced an increase from 0.09 to 0.11 per 100,000 (AAPC 0.72). Regionally, East Asia's ASMR declined at an AAPC of -2.70, Southern Latin America at -3.13, and Southeast Asia increased at 1.76. Age-specific peaks in ASMR shifted from 55-59 and 65-69 years in 1990 to 65-69 and 70-74 years in 2021. Projections forecast male ASMR of 0.35 per 100,000 (95% UI 0.03-0.67) and female ASMR of 0.02 per 100,000 (95% UI 0.00-0.04) by 2040. Although global ASMR and ASDR for NPC-AU declined markedly from 1990 to 2021, rising burdens in lower-SDI regions, persistent male predominance, and shifting peaks to older age groups highlight the need for targeted alcohol-control policies and age-tailored screening.",

For these optical tools to be clinically available, a multicenter trial is needed. We investigate if SHG-based prognostic signals vary with patient race, providing insight for designing such a trial. SHG imaging was performed on colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient samples to derive two prognostic indicators. We assessed the association between these indicators and patient race. SHG images were analyzed as previously described to determine the forward- to backward-SHG scattering ratio (F/B) and fiber angle variability (FAV). Both prognostic measurements were compared between Black and White patients. In the IDC cohort, F/B from the tumor-stroma interface differed significantly between demographic groups. For the CRC cohort, a trend was observed in the tumor-stroma interface and tumor bulk. FAV did not vary by race in either cohort. F/B variation with patient race suggests the relationship between F/B and metastatic outcome may vary with patient race. These findings highlight the potential need for race-specific prognostic algorithms to improve metastasis prediction for all patients.",

This study aims to address the challenges posed by tumors in reducing the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) through mechanisms such as hypoxia and abnormal blood vessel formations. In this study, manganese-containing DNA nanoflowers (DHA-DDF) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) were functionalized with an AS1411 aptamer and a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) antisense sequence. The in vitro tests confirmed their stability and pH-responsive drug release properties. The combined treatment of DHA-DDF and ultrasound could induce apoptosis, inhibit the migration and invasion of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, and down-regulate the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in LLC cells. The in vivo studies using subcutaneous LLC in mice showed that ultrasound enhanced the tumor-targeted accumulation and penetration of DHA-DDF. The combined approach markedly reduced tumor development and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, effectively down-regulated the expression of hypoxia-related genes, inhibited cell proliferation, and blocked tumor angiogenesis. The programmable, biocompatible, and multifunctional nanoflowers demonstrate a notable improvement in the efficacy of SDT and provide robust tumor inhibition in both cellular and animal models.

However, the conventional matrices derived from murine tumors, commonly used to generate PDX models, suffer from key limitations such as lack of tissue specificity, high production costs, and inconsistent batch quality. In response, our study investigates the use of decellularized liver extracellular matrix (Liver ECM) as a biomimetic alternative that more accurately recapitulates the native hepatic microenvironment. We demonstrate that Liver ECM, enriched with liver-specific biochemical cues, enables robust engraftment, growth, and metastasis of patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells in both subcutaneous and orthotopic PDX models. Notably, orthotopic models established with Liver ECM exhibited enhanced metastatic behavior, particularly to the intestine, compared to those formed using conventional matrices. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed activation of key pathways associated with cancer progression, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration, and inflammation. Additionally, we extend the application of Liver ECM to patient-derived organoid xenografts, which showed improved tumorigenicity and retained pathophysiological features of the original tumor tissue. Together, these findings underscore the potential of liver-specific ECM as a superior platform for generating physiologically relevant PDX models and enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical cancer studies.",

Circulating RNA, associated with various carriers including extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipoproteins (LPPs), or protein complexes, presents a viable target for the identification of ALK fusions by liquid biopsy. Our aim was to characterize the specific carrier of ALK fusion RNA, a crucial step in the development of diagnostic methods for clinical use. Methods: We employed optimized size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate EVs, LPPs, and protein-enriched fractions from ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines and from pools of plasma obtained from NSCLC patients with ALK translocations. We optimized RNA fusion transcript detection using digital PCR (dPCR). Results: Protein analyses confirmed the successful resolution of EVs, LPPs, and protein fractions by optimized SEC. Our dPCR results indicated that ALK fusions were more prevalent in tetraspanin-enriched SEC fractions from NSCLC cell lines, suggesting that EVs serve as the primary carrier for ALK fusion RNA. After optimization for larger volumes of samples of the RNA isolation protocol, we could also demonstrate that ALK fusion transcripts were found exclusively in EVs from patient plasma. Of note, the circulating number of copies of the transcript was below 5 copies/mL. Discussion: Our findings underscore the potential of EV-associated RNA as a promising source for detecting ALK fusion variants in plasma samples from NSCLC patients, offering a non-invasive diagnostic approach with significant clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Aim: The domain of exosomal circRNAs has seen rapid growth over the past few years, yet a thorough synthesis of the scholarly contributions has been lacking. This study employs bibliometric analysis to uncover the focal points and trends in exosomal circRNA research. Methods: We selected articles on exosomal circRNAs from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and deployed VOSviewer for co-authorship and co-occurrence analysis. CiteSpace was tapped to calculate citation bursts for documents and keywords, generating a time-zone map. Additionally, the bibliometrix R package was employed to identify locally cited references and construct thematic maps and trend topics. Results: The exosomal circRNA research field has produced 767 articles over the past decade. China and Fudan University lead in publication counts, ranking first among countries and institutions, respectively. The journal with the highest number of publications and citations is Molecular Cancer. Zhang Wei and Li Yan are the top contributors and the most co-cited authors, respectively. Analysis of the results suggests that research related to the tumor microenvironment (TAM) may be a recent research hotspot. Among the latest keywords, terms such as microenvironment, macrophage, mesenchymal stem cells, and ceRNA appear frequently. The keyword with the most recent citation burst is ceRNA. The latest trend topic is the macrophage, and mesenchymal stem cell is identified as an emerging theme. Conclusion: This study elucidates the hotspots and trends in exosomal circRNA research through bibliometric analysis. Themes related to the TAM, especially directions involving macrophages, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, will likely open a new chapter in exosomal circRNA research.",

Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR was used to further verify the expression of miR-145-5p in GC cells and the 41 pairs of GC tissues and adjacent tissues. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the correlation between miR-145-5p and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GC. The proliferation ability and cell cycle of AGS and MKN28 were detected by CCK-8, Edu and flow cytometry. The downstream target genes of miR-145-5p were screened by bioinformatics and further verified by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of SMAD5 in GC tissues. Western blot was used to detect cell cycle-related proteins that were regulated by siRNA SMAD5. The expression of miR-145-5p was lower in GC tissues and cells compared with adjacent tissues and GES-1, and was related to the poor prognosis of patients with GC. Overexpression of miR-145-5p inhibited the proliferation of GC cells and blocked the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase. MiR-145-5p targeted SMAD5 to inhibit the proliferation, and arrested the G1/S phase transition of GC cells. Mechanistically, SMAD5 siRNA significantly reduced CCND1 protein expression, Bioinformatics databases predicted that cyclin D1 was the transcription target gene of SMAD5. Moreover, the re-expression of cyclin D1 partially reversed the cell cycle arrest that was induced by SMAD5 depletion in GC cells. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel role of the miR-145-5p/SMAD5/cyclin D1 axis in modulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in GC, which may provide a prognostic biomarker for GC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Known for its widespread outbreaks, including the 2013-2016 epidemic that infected almost 29 000 individuals and resulted in approximately 11 300 deaths, Ebola virus (EBOV) and related filoviruses remain a current threat as consecutive filoviral outbreaks have occurred between 2021 through 2025. Due to high fatality rates of 40-90% among infected individuals, researchers have invested significant efforts to discover effective treatments for Ebola virus disease. Small molecules hold great potential for treating Ebola virus disease because they can target various stages of the filoviral life cycle, such as entry, transcription, replication, and egress; however, the FDA has not yet approved any small molecule treatments for EBOV. In this review, we report both historic and recent progress in the discovery of small molecule drugs for EBOV.",

The new class of medicines based on RNAi combines the process of diagnosis and treatment via sequence-specific recognition of biomarker mRNAs and downregulation of their translation. While this approach proved clinically successful, safer, and more personalized options that mitigate adverse effects can be revealed by separating diagnostic and treatment steps. A concept is introduced that allows RNAi therapies to selectively exert their function within diseased cells. The reconfigurable nucleic acid nanoparticles, or recNANPs, recognize overexpressed cancer biomarkers and conditionally release RNAi inducers targeting apoptosis inhibitors in pancreatic cancer cells. RecNANPs are non-immunostimulatory, achieve prolonged gene silencing compared to conventional RNAi inducers, and can be combined with chemotherapy. It is anticipated that this modular platform will enable further advancements in the development of biocompatible nanodevices activated by intracellular variables of choice, facilitating treatment with a repertoire of nucleic acid therapies.",

The Industrial Revolution, advancing technology and society, led to elevated air pollution levels, contributing to acid rain, smog, ozone depletion, and global warming. Poor air quality increases risks of respiratory inflammation, tuberculosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumoconiosis, and lung cancer. In this context, developing reliable air pollution forecasting models is imperative for guiding effective mitigation strategies and policy interventions. This study presents a daily air pollution prediction model focusing on Jakarta's sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO) levels, leveraging a hybrid methodology that integrates Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) with the Fuzzy Time Series Markov Chain (FTSMC) approach. The analysis revealed five distinct clusters, with medoid selection refined iteratively to ensure stabilization. A 5 × 5 Markov transition probability matrix was subsequently constructed for modeling the data. Predicted values for SO₂ and CO in Jakarta using the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method showed strong alignment with the actual data. Forecasting accuracy results for SO₂ and CO in Jakarta, based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), showed excellent performance, underscoring the efficacy of the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid approach in predicting air pollution levels.•The CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method demonstrates high effectiveness in analyzing large datasets, addressing the limitations of previous hybrid clustering fuzzy time series methods.•The number of fuzzy time series partitions is optimally determined based on clustering results obtained through the gap statistic approach, ensuring robust partitioning.•The forecasting accuracy of the CLARA-FTSMC hybrid method, evaluated using MAE and RMSE, showed excellent performance in predicting daily air pollution levels of SO₂ and CO in Jakarta.",

More recently, the pig-to-human brain-dead decedent model was introduced with claims that this might replace (or at least augment) the pig-to-NHP model. There are, however, several limitations of the decedent model, most notably the very limited period during which the subject may remain sufficiently metabolically and hemodynamically stable to allow meaningful monitoring of the fate of a pig organ graft. It will be exceedingly difficult to provide the regulatory authorities with data from experiments in which truly prolonged graft function has been monitored, whereas this is already being achieved in the pig-to-NHP model. In view of the complications related to the effects of brain death, the data obtained from xenotransplantation experiments in decedents may provide confusing results. There is a real risk that this may influence the regulatory authorities to become overly cautious in approving formal clinical trials of pig organ xenotransplantation to be initiated. We conclude that experiments in human decedents will be unable to replace studies in pig-to-NHP models.",

Meanwhile, genome-wide DNA methylation-based molecular profiling has been established to allow robust brain tumor classification. Does DNA methylation-based molecular profiling make a relevant contribution to the diagnosis and resolution of these non-specific neuro-oncological cases. We screened all neurosurgical cases at our institution between 2009 and 2021 with suspected neuro-oncological diseases on MRI but negative or unspecific histopathological diagnosis. We differentiated two groups: cases with cell-enriched, reactive tissue (with or without suspected single tumor cells), insufficient to classify the lesion according to WHO 2021 diagnostic criteria for CNS tumors (group 1) and cases that were not cell-enriched, without reactive changes and no suspected tumor cells (group 2). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the feasibility of establishing a molecular diagnosis in accordance with the WHO 2021 diagnostic criteria for CNS tumors. 23 cases with unspecified histopathological diagnosis were identified, 16 cases were assigned to group 1, seven cases to group 2. DNA-methylation-based profiling and copy number variations enabled a tumor diagnosis in nine (56.3 %) cases in group 1 and three (42.9 %) cases in group 2, adding up to 12 tumors (52.2 %). Five cases were identified as physiological cortex.

We present the treatment course and outcome of an adolescent male diagnosed with a thalamic DMG carrying a histone H3.3 K27M (H3K27M) alteration. Tumor biopsies were taken at diagnosis for histological analysis, molecular profiling, and ex vivo drug sensitivity testing (DST). Seven months after diagnosis, the patient had recurrent/progressive disease after radiotherapy and an ineffective molecular-guided therapy based on tumor molecular profiling. The patient then started a novel functional precision medicine (FPM)-guided two-drug combination of disulfiram, based on the DST results of this drug on the patient's tumor cells obtained at diagnosis, and ONC 201, the only drug that has advanced to a phase III clinical trial for H3K27M-DMG. Neuroimaging demonstrated a treatment response, and the patient lived for fifteen months after starting this personalized therapy.

    "abstract": "The efficacy and immune-mediated safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain controversial. Given TNBC's aggressive biology and poor prognosis, definitive evidence is urgently needed. We performed this meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the benefits and safety of these inhibitors by examining clinical trial data for TNBC. Up until October 25, 2024, a thorough search was done in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to find research assessing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in treating TNBC. This study ultimately included 8 randomized controlled trials involving 5,512 patients. Pathological complete response (pCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were among the primary objectives, which defined as adverse drug reactions affecting various organ systems due to immune system activation, were graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria. The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased pCR rates by 77% compared to chemotherapy alone (OR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.28-2.45, P<0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the benefit of pCR was more evident in patients with lymph node positivity(OR=2.57,95% CI:1.76-3.75, P < 0.01). For EFS, the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) combination therapy decreased the possibility of events by 35% (HR=0.65,95%CI:0.54-0.80, P< 0.01), with notable benefits observed in earlier-stage (T1-T2) patients(HR= 0.53, 95%CI:0.40-0.70, P < 0.01). Similarly, PFS was improved in the experimental group for both ITT (HR=0.79,95% CI, 0.71-0.88, P<0.01) and PD-L1 positive populations (HR=0.71,95%CI:0.63-0.81, P < 0.01). However, the incidence of irAEs was significantly higher in the ICIs group compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (OR=2.77,95% CI:1.93-3.96, P < 0.01). With lymph node status acting as a crucial predictor, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and neoadjuvant chemotherapy dramatically improves pCR and EFS in TNBC. Additionally, it improves OS and PFS, although at the cost of an increased incidence of irAEs. These findings offer insightful information for upcoming clinical trial designs, economic evaluations, and clinical decision-making in TNBC treatment. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42025640551.",

Most mutations in ALK gene result from translocations with other genes, forming fusion oncogenes. To date, 21 different genes have been identified as ALK fusion partners, each activating distinct signaling pathways that influence cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are widely utilized as first-line therapy. Lorlatinib, a third-generation ALK inhibitor, is effective in both treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC, exhibiting strong systemic and intracranial antitumor activity. This report presented a case of lung adenocarcinoma with 51 genetic variants, including a rare fusion variant: exon 15 of KIF5B fused to exon 20 of ALK, KIF5B-ALK (K15:A20). Following lorlatinib treatment, partial remission was achieved, and disease stability was maintained for an extended period, suggesting a favorable response to therapy. This case highlighted the potential sensitivity of the KIF5B-ALK (K15:A20) fusion to lorlatinib and the need for further investigation into lorlatinib's efficacy across different KIF5B-ALK fusion variants. Additionally, other fusion types and treatment options for KIF5B-ALK fusions with varying breakpoints were discussed.",

A total of 57 ESCC patients who underwent dual-phase DECT scans were included. Key parameters measured were iodine concentration (IC), water concentration (WC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), spectral Hounsfield unit curve slope (λHu), and effective atomic number (Zeff). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with Ki-67 expression levels. Results showed that high Ki-67 expression correlated with significantly higher Zeff and IC values in the venous phase (VP) (P = 0.047 and P = 0.049, respectively; AUC = 0.67 for both), and lower WC in the arterial phase (AP) (P = 0.021; AUC = 0.70). Multivariate analysis revealed that IC in VP and WC in AP were independent predictors of Ki-67 overexpression. The combination of these two parameters yielded an AUC of 0.78 for predicting Ki-67 overexpression, with 68.3% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, and 73.7% accuracy. DECT parameters demonstrate potential for non-invasive Ki-67 status detection in ESCC, offering valuable insights for clinical diagnosis and prognosis.",

Although demographic factors have been reported to correlate with public health program efficiency, it remains unclear whether this applies to cancer screening. To evaluate the efficiency of cancer screening programs conducted in Japanese municipalities and analyze their relationship with demographic characteristics, including population size and aging rates. A cross-sectional study using national open-source data from 2019. We collected data from all 1741 Japanese municipalities in 2019 using a national open-source database. After applying inclusion criteria, 1593 municipalities were analyzed. Program efficiency was measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), with inputs including the number of public health nurses, medical institutions, and healthcare expenditure per target population. Outputs were cancer screening participation rates. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between efficiency, population size, aging rates, and their interaction. Of the 1593 municipalities analyzed, 414 (26.0%) were deemed efficient. A statistically significant interaction between aging rates and population size was observed in the model predicting screening efficiency. In municipalities with aging rates above 31.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.2-37.1), larger target populations were associated with lower efficiency. Conversely, in municipalities with over 1075 screening targets (95% CI: 552-1381), higher aging rates were linked to lower efficiency. This study suggests that aging rates and population size may be associated with municipal-level differences in the efficiency of cancer screening programs. Understanding the mechanism underlying this relationship could help inform resource allocation and program design. Further research is warranted to explore these relationships more deeply and to support the development of more efficient screening strategies, particularly in the context of ongoing demographic shifts.",

Assessing how this performance varies with these factors is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of biomarkers and to identify areas for improvement in sub-populations with poor performance. Additionally, the presence of competing risks complicates the assessment of discriminative performance. Ignoring competing risks can lead to misleading conclusions, as the biomarker's performance for the event of interest, such as disease onset, may be confounded by its performance for competing events, such as death. To address these challenges, we develop a regression model to assess the impact of covariates on the discriminative performance of biomarkers, characterized by the covariate-specific time-dependent Area-undercurve (AUC) for a specific cause. We construct a pseudo partial-likelihood for estimation and inference and establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators.

Nevertheless, it is still uncertain if there is a relationship between ALDOB levels, prognosis, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of ALDOB in ccRCC and its potential association with clinicopathological features and tumor immune microenvironment. By integrating multi-database bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we seek to elucidate the role of ALDOB in ccRCC progression and its potential as a predictive biomarker. To ascertain the potential link between ALDOB level, clinical parameters, and overall survival (OS) in individuals with ccRCC, we employed diverse databases, which include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer data analysis Portal (UALCAN). Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the link between tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) and ALDOB was carried out using the TIMER database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to identify the ALDOB level in a tissue microarray. The expression of ALDOB demonstrated a strong association with pathologic T stage, pathologic N stage, pathologic M stage, histologic grade, and gender. Decreased ALDOB level was linked to unfavorable disease-specific survival (DSS), progress free interval (PFI), and OS outcomes (p < 0.001). Subsequently, a marked link was observed between ALDOB level and a heightened presence of infiltrating Treg, Th17 cells, and neutrophils in ccRCC. IHC showed that the ALDOB level in ccRCC samples was notably diminished relative to that in the adjacent normal tissues. As a prospective predictive indicator for individuals with ccRCC, reduced ALDOB level exhibited strong correlations with clinical characteristics, unfavorable outcomes, and immune infiltration in individuals with ccRCC.",

The procedure was completed in 80 min, with fetal vitality monitored during surgery. A live female newborn was delivered by cesarean section at 32 weeks of gestation for premature rupture of ovular membranes, weighing 1620 g. The newborn demonstrated appropriate gastrointestinal function and was discharged at 14 days without the need for further surgical interventions. This case report demonstrates the feasibility and safety of fetoscopic repair of gastroschisis, resulting in favorable neonatal outcomes, including early discharge without additional surgery. The approach warrants further investigation by randomized clinical trial to evaluate its benefits compared to standard postnatal treatment for gastroschisis, especially in complex suspect cases.

    "abstract": "Developing a cost-effective synthesis route for NiO at room temperature with a low calcination temperature (∼200 °C) remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel, eco-friendly approach for synthesizing zero-dimensional NiO quantum dots (QDs) via a simple coprecipitation method using minimal reagents and energy-efficient processing. The resulting NiO QDs are obtained in powder form, enabling easy handling, storage, and integration into various applications. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and Raman spectra confirm the presence of interstitial oxygen (Oi) and nickel vacancies (VNi), indicative of intrinsic defects. Temperature-dependent conductivity analysis reveals two distinct regions separated by half the Debye temperature (θD), suggesting the formation of small-polaron-like bound Zhang-Rice states. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies conducted on A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines and L132 normal cells demonstrate selective toxicity toward cancer cells. These findings highlight the potential of defect-engineered NiO QDs for multifunctional applications, including optoelectronics and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion of surrounding tissues, and metastasis to distant organs. Among various malignancies, colon cancer is particularly aggressive and often associated with poor prognosis in advanced stages. This study presents the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a new series of morpholine-benzimidazole-oxadiazole derivatives as potential anticancer agents. The anticancer potential of the synthesized derivatives was assessed through MTT assays against the human colon cancer cell line (HT-29) and normal fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) to evaluate their selectivity. To further investigate their mechanism of action, VEGFR-2 enzyme inhibition assays were conducted, as VEGFR-2 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and tumor progression. Compound 5h exhibited potent VEGFR-2 inhibition (IC50 = 0.049 ± 0.002 μM), comparable to the reference drug sorafenib (IC50 = 0.037 ± 0.001 μM), while compounds 5j (IC50 = 0.098 ± 0.011 μM) and 5c (IC50 = 0.915 ± 0.027 μM) also showed notable inhibitory effects. Structural analysis suggested that the presence of chlorine atoms at both the third and fourth positions in the phenyl ring of compound 5h enhanced its binding affinity within the ATP-binding pocket of VEGFR-2, contributing to its potent inhibition. Moreover, in silico studies (molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations) confirmed that compounds 5c, 5h, and 5j effectively interact with the VEGFR-2 active site and exhibit stability throughout the simulation period, reinforcing their potential as sustained VEGFR-2 inhibitors. These results highlight the promising therapeutic potential of morpholine-benzimidazole-oxadiazole derivatives as selective VEGFR-2 inhibitors for the treatment of colon cancer.",

As the intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal tract serve as primary contact points for these contaminants, potentially eliminating residues or suffering direct damage leading to dysbiosis, probiotic interventions have emerged as promising therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate, in mice, the consequences of subchronic exposure to low doses of a mixture of three pesticides: glyphosate (15 mg/kg body weight/day), imidacloprid (5 mg/kg body weight/day), and tebuconazole (4 mg/kg body weight/day). Mice were exposed for 6 weeks. The probiotic subsp. longum strain 51A was employed as a therapeutic strategy for gut microbiota modulation. Exposed animals experienced adverse metabolic and genotoxic effects including increased cholesterol and reduced insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and intestinal dysbiosis. 51A reversed these effects, improving metabolism and reducing prediabetes markers. As the first study examining this specific pesticide combination, imidacloprid, tebuconazole, and glyphosate highlight the distinct impact of pesticide mixtures on health, suggesting that intestinal dysbiosis may drive the observed metabolic changes, with microbiota modulation aiding recovery.",

    "abstract": "Due to the limitations of conventional synthesis and the growing utilization of nanoparticles, recent efforts have shifted to green approaches such as utilizing plant waste extracts. A novel initiative to repurpose household and agricultural green waste for the generation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) offers a sustainable, low-cost alternative that addresses environmental and economic concerns. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the multi-round recyclability of (CA), green tea (GT), and Virginia creeper (VC) waste for AgNP production, then conduct a comprehensive physicochemical and bioactivity characterization of the nanoparticles. The study was designed to prepare AgNPs using waste from CA, GT, and VC generated by one, two, and three rounds of leftover extractions, then the obtained nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Their toxicity on malignant and nonmalignant human cells was evaluated by viability assays, the antimicrobial performance was assessed on Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and against and by microdilution method. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was examined by a staining method, and the AgNP-related silver ion release was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Our findings confirmed successful synthesis of AgNPs utilizing recycled waste materials; nevertheless, the plant type and extraction round influenced AgNP properties to a unique combination of nanoparticle size and stability. All AgNPs showed strong toxicity against human cancer cells, albeit affecting also noncancerous fibroblasts. GT-derived AgNPs exerted potent antibacterial activity, while those by VC had strong antifungal effects. The observed bioactivity correlated with the increasing number of extraction cycles and was the result of enhanced silver ion-releasing capability that culminated in increased ROS levels. These findings demonstrate the viability of multi-round extract recycling for sustainable AgNP synthesis and suggest potential applications in industrial fields such as antimicrobial air filtration systems.",

    "abstract": "Although cisplatin (DDP) is commonly used in the clinical treatment of lung cancer, the associated side effects remained serious. Chinese medicine can be used to increase the sensitivity of the body to antitumor drugs while reducing their adverse effects. polysaccharide (CSP), which is derived from , has already been demonstrated to regulate immune function, but the effects of CSP in combination with DDP have not yet been reported. In this study, we explore the synergistic and attenuated toxicity effects of CSP combined with DDP. Our results revealed that DDP and DDP + CSP combination treatment both induced cytotoxicity in LLC1 lung cancer cells and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cancer cells, and that CSP significantly increased tumor cell death. Moreover, cell toxicity in DDP-treated RAW 264.7 cells was suppressed by CSP. In a mouse model generated on LLC1 tumor-bearing mice, CSP and DDP combination treatment significantly increased DDP-induced tumor cell death. Western analysis revealed that this was achieved via CSP regulation of the expression levels of proteins involved in pyroptosiscaspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD). In addition, CSP reduced oxidative stress levels to help alleviate the acute renal toxicity caused by DDP. In summary, our study provides further evidence of the efficacy of CSP and it lays a foundation for the clinical use of CSP as an adjuvant chemotherapy drug.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a vital biological response of the human immune system to harmful stimuli, and it plays a vital role in tissue repair and pathogen elimination. However, chronic inflammation can lead to severe diseases such as arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and autoimmune conditions. Anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents owing to their high selectivity, potency toward target cells, and minimal side effects. Although numerous computational predictors exist for predicting AIP samples, most rely on traditional compositional features that fail to capture internal sequence ordering, local structural variations, and evolutionary information to determine peptide functionality. To address these problems, we propose DeepAIPs-SFLA, a novel deep learning-based computational model that integrates evolutionary information and structural features using advanced image-based encoding. The training sequences were transformed into two-dimensional structural and evolutionary images using RECM and PSSM embeddings. These images were further decomposed using LBP and CLBP algorithms, resulting in novel local texture descriptors: RECM_CLBP, PSSM_CLBP, and RECM_LBP. A differential evolution-based feature integration method was employed to construct a comprehensive multiview feature vector. Subsequently, an enhanced genetic algorithm-based shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) was applied for optimal feature selection. An optimal feature set was used to train a deep residual convolutional neural network (RCNN). Our developed DeepAIPs-SFLA model attained an outstanding predictive accuracy of 97.04% with an AUC of 0.98 using the training sequences. The model was validated via independent sets to examine its generalization power, demonstrating substantial enhancements of 13 and 2% in accuracy compared with available predictors on the Ind-426 and Ind-1049 data sets, respectively. The robustness and efficacy of DeepAIPs-SFLA represent its potential as a valuable model for advancing academic research and drug discovery for inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nanomaterials hold significant promise in targeted cancer therapy due to their unique physicochemical properties and functional versatility. Among these, metal-phosphate-organic frameworks (MPOFs) have emerged as particularly attractive candidates for drug delivery applications. In this study, copper-(II)- and strontium-(II)-based MPOFs were synthesized and loaded with l-arginine, doxorubicin (DOX), or both, and their cytotoxic effects were evaluated against MCF-7 and A549 cancer cell lines. The synthesized nanomaterials included l-Arg@Cu-(II)-MPOF, DOX/l-Arg@Cu-(II)-MPOF, DOX@Cu-(II)-MPOF, l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOF, DOX/l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOF, and DOX@Sr-(II)-MPOF. The synthesis was performed at different pH values (5, 7.4, 9, and 11). The Cu-(II)-based MPOFs were successfully synthesized at pH 5, 7.4, and 9, while the Sr-(II)-based MPOFs could be obtained only at pH 11. The FT-IR and X-ray diffraction spectra of the synthesized MPOFs were used to characterize their structural and chemical compositions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), EDX, and elemental mapping analyses were also used to identify the surface morphology and elemental makeup. The surface morphology of the Cu-(II)-MPOFs, as shown by the FESEM images, had a well-defined crystalline porous nanoflower architecture with a size between 6.3 and 18.1 μm. Interestingly, the l-Arg@Sr-(II)-MPOFs also developed a stacked porous flower-like architecture, but the inclusion of DOX interfered with this architecture such that the nanosheet-like architecture was formed. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized MPOFs was determined by MTT assays in MCF-7 and A549 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 4.19 to 22.83 μg/mL. The highest cytotoxic activity was shown by MPOFs with DOX as the only ligand in both cell lines. Also, the DOX@Cu-(II)-MPOF prepared at pH 9 revealed maximum anticancer activity, with an IC50 of 4.73 μg/mL against MCF-7 and 4.19 μg/mL against A549 cells. Sr-(II)-based MPOFs proved to be more cytotoxic toward the A549 cell line. Specifically, the DOX@Sr-(II)-MPOF proved to be most active, with an IC50 of 5.51 μg/mL against A549 cells. These results identify the promising cytotoxicity of the prepared MPOFs and introduce their prospects as new targeted cancer therapy platforms.",

    "abstract": "Prostatic urethral obstruction (PUO) is the urethral narrowing by the external pressure of an enlarged prostate, which hinders the ability to pass urine normally. The most common reasons for an enlarged prostate are prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. In this study, we aimed to develop a drug-loaded shape-memory polymer urethral stent (SMPUS) to address PUO. The SMPUS was designed to combine both mechanical and chemical/herbal treatment of PUO. Successfully, SMPUS shows potential mechanical efficacy through its shape-memory properties that ensure the patency of the urethral lumen by restoring its tube-like stent shape upon flushing with hot water at its melting temperature. Additionally, the in vitro drug release investigation shows the capability of SMPUS to serve as a versatile drug delivery platform, after further in vivo investigation, enabling the release of the selected drugs to treat the primary diseases associated with PUO while mitigating the systemic side effects associated with conventional treatments. Both polymer and drug concentrations can be modulated to achieve the required mechanical and thermal properties based on the case progress. This adaptability of the developed SMPUS allows for future in vivo and clinical trials in medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the common malignant tumors among women, and in recent years, the role of gut microbiota in tumorigenesis has been increasingly gaining attention.Existing research has shown that the gut microbiome, establishes axis connections with multiple extra-intestinal organs. However, whether gut microbes affect the process of endometrial carcinogenesis through metabolic pathways and the specific mechanisms by which they promote the development of EC remain unclear. This study aims to explore the impact of overweight-mediated gut microbiota on the initiation or progression of EC and to assess its relationship with metabolites, thereby providing new insights for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we analyzed gut microbiota differences among normal-weight, overweight EC patients, and healthy controls using 16S rRNA sequencing. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and KEGG analysis identified group-specific metabolites and pathways, while Spearman correlation analysis revealed associations between microbiota and metabolites. This study revealed that in the ECMO group, the genus Megamonas exhibited the highest abundance and significant intergroup differences (H=13.46, P<0.05). Additionally, the Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratio (B/B ratio) gradually increased in the CN, ECMN, ECMO group. LEfSe analysis identified Megamonas and Amedibacillus as potential biomarkers for the ECMO group. Serum metabolomics of overweight EC patients highlighted lipid metabolism-related metabolites with the most specific expression. KEGG enrichment analysis of differential metabolites highlighted that the Glycerophospholipid metabolism and Purine metabolism pathways were notably significant in both the ECMN and ECMO groups. The study found significantly elevated abundance of Megamonas in the gut microbiota of overweight EC patients, which may promote EC progression by degrading inositol to enhance lipid absorption. This reveals the role of gut microbiota in EC pathogenesis through lipid metabolism regulation, providing a theoretical basis for microbiota-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

Collagen-based materials, employed as dermal fillers to smooth wrinkles, have attained extensive utilization. Nevertheless, traditional animal-derived collagen protein primarily presents concerns pertaining to disease risks, potential immunological reactions, and batch instability. Here, we introduced a highly durable 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether cross-linked recombinant human collagen type III (rhCol III) microgel as dermal filler for rejuvenating aging skin. The rhCol III microgel exhibited exceptional thermostability, mechanical strength and injectability. Subsequently, we established a UV-photoaging skin animal model and chose rhCol III microgel as a bioactive material for in vivo implantation, systematically comparing its biological effect with commercialized collagen I (Col I) derived from porcine skin (pCollagen) and hyaluronic acid through histological observation, immunofluorescence staining, hydroxyproline quantification and analysis of specific gene expression. Outcomes indicated rhCol III microgel prompted augmented production of Col I, collagen III (Col III) and elastic fibers, thereby contributing to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In summary, our investigation contributed to robust biosafety and rejuvenation of UV-induced skin photoaging by rhCol III under a single injection for 6 weeks. Despite the imperative ongoing efforts required for the successful translation from bench to clinic, the discernibly superior safety and efficacy of rhCol III microgel present an innovative methodology in combating skin aging, offering significant promise in medical cosmetology and tissue engineering.",

This exploratory study proposes a machine learning approach integrating radiomic features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans to improve classification accuracy for glioblastomas (GBM), meningiomas, brain metastases, and normal controls (NC). A total of 154 patients (74 GBM, 62 meningioma, 18 brain metastases) and 170 NCs were included in the study. MRI scans underwent standard preprocessing. To address class imbalance, data augmentation was applied to the GBM, meningioma, and brain metastases groups, increasing their sample sizes to 148, 124, and 180 cases, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analysis and Curvelet-based transformations. Feature selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multicollinearity assessment using the Spearman correlation test. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed. Nine machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and LightGBM, were trained and evaluated. Random Forest and CatBoost achieved the highest performance, with 95.2% accuracy using LASSO-selected features, outperforming other classifiers. Combining GLCM and Curvelet features improved accuracy over either set alone. PCA-based dimensionality reduction (99% variance) also performed well, but slightly below LASSO. Integrating Curvelet and GLCM-based radiomics with optimized models improves diagnostic accuracy, offering a promising tool to assist radiologists in tumor classification.",

Exosomes were obtained from mesenchymal stem cells and loaded with G. frondosa extract (extract-exosomes) by sonication.

    "abstract": "Early detection of bowel cancer is crucial for substantially improving patient outcomes, highlighting the need for less invasive diagnostic methods. Herein, an innovative diagnostic application of vibrating microrobots combined with laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to minimally invasively estimate the elasticity of potential tumors and surrounding healthy tissue is proposed. By positioning a vibrating microrobot on tissue surfaces, the resonant frequencies of the resulting vibrations are analyzed to create detailed elasticity maps. These maps reveal tumor margins and provide critical information about the tumor's properties spatially. This approach leverages the high spatio-temporal resolution and noncontact nature of LSCI to offer a minimally invasive elastography method for potential use in colonoscopy, providing an alternative to complex and time-consuming biopsy analysis and advancing future cancer diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by bacteria flagella, miniature robots often use a helical shape to propel themselves in fluids at low Reynolds numbers. The helical microstructures in the robots are often rigid and are made by advanced 3D micro-/nanofabrication techniques. However, it remains challenging to fabricate these 3D helical structures without complicated machinery. Herein, for the first time, a magnetically transformable millirobot-TwistBot-with a flexible body that can transform from a simple flat ribbon to a helical shape under an applied magnetic field is reported, enabling its propulsion in viscous fluids. The robot's twisting is modeled using numerical simulation and its geometry is optimized to maximize the twist angle. The unique shape transformation not only allows the propulsion through narrow lumens but also facilitates TwistBot in carrying and delivering solid cargo successfully to the target. The concept of the TwistBot opens new opportunities in designing soft transformable minirobots for targeted cargo delivery.",

Hence, assessment of improvement in quality of life (QOL) for evaluating treatment is critical. Target delineation for radiotherapy in HGG is often done according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Radiotherapy and Oncology Group (RTOG) contouring guidelines, which differs on exclusion and inclusion of peritumoral edema believed to harbor malignant cells; the guidelines have not been prospectively compared for probable difference in QOL, considering the probable difference in treated volume. This article compares QOL in HGG patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy using target volume delineation based on the RTOG or EORTC guidelines. In this single-center, prospective randomized exploratory study, postoperative HGG patients were randomized to either receive radiotherapy according to the EORTC guidelines of target delineation (60 Gy/30 fractions to tumor bed and residual tumor) or the RTOG guidelines (46 Gy/23fractions to tumor bed, residual tumor, and peritumoral edema with 14 Gy/7 fraction boost to the tumor bed and residual tumor) with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) followed by 6 months of adjuvant TMZ. The aim and primary endpoint of the study was to assess and compare QOL between the arms. Descriptive statistics were used to convey demographic data, proportions for categorical variables, and mean, median, range, and standard deviation for continuous variables. Effect size was assessed using partial eta squared test where values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14 signify small, medium, and large effect size, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance test was used for comparison of means and assessment of QOL between the EORTC and RTOG groups at 6 months. Absolute volume of planning target volume (PTV) receiving 46 and 60 Gy were described, PTV 46/60 was also described in terms of % of whole brain volume. Eighteen patients underwent randomization (9 in EORTC and RTOG group each). Statistically significant improvement was noted in the overall posttreatment values in the physical well-being (PWB) domain ( p  = 0.007). This is the first study to compare the EORTC and RTOG delineation techniques in terms of QOL. No significant differences in QOL were noted between the two arms. Significant improvement was noted posttreatment in PWB of overall patients.",

However, differences can occur in biopsy results obtained from the same patient. In our study, we aimed to investigate the importance of pathological examination, which is a possible reason for the differences in patients' immunohistochemistry results. For this purpose, patients were divided into 3 groups. The differences in estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, and Ki-67 were examined between the following groups: patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then underwent surgery (41 patients), patients who underwent surgery without chemotherapy (50 patients), and the same specimen from a different center and our center (21 patients). The pathological discordance rates were 34.1% in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, 28% in the surgery without chemotherapy group, and 38.1% in the comparison between our institution and an external center, with no statistically significant difference across the 3 groups (P = .667). When examining the changes within each group, statistically significant differences were found in HER2 (P = .002) for the tru-cut biopsy surgery group and Ki-67 (P = .025) for the group comparing our center to an external center.

Genital porokeratosis (GP), especially involving the penis, is extremely uncommon, with only a handful of cases reported worldwide. This case report describes the first instance of penile porokeratosis from Nepal, highlighting its rarity and clinical presentation. A 22-year-old male presented with a 3 × 3 cm annular plaque on the shaft of his penis, which had been asymptomatic for a year. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of porokeratosis, and tests for sexually transmitted infections were negative. Following a single session of cryotherapy, the patient was counseled about the benign nature of the lesion. Regular follow-ups were scheduled every 4 weeks for additional cryotherapy and to monitor for any potential malignant change. GP is a rare condition, potentially triggered by environmental factors like heat and friction. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its similarity to other dermatoses, making histopathology essential. Although other forms of porokeratosis carry a risk of malignancy, there are no known cases of GP progressing to cancer. Penile porokeratosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent genital lesions. A biopsy is crucial for accurate diagnosis, as misdiagnosis can delay appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to better understand this rare disease, including its incidence, pathophysiology, and risk of malignant transformation.",

There are increasing evidences about the role of obesity, which is usually assessed using body mass index (BMI), and hypercholesterolemia in breast cancer development through different mechanisms including the interplay with the immune response. The histopathological grading, which reflects the degree of differentiation, could be used to determine the aggressiveness of breast cancer. Limited studies assessed the correlation between the previous factors and histopathological grading in breast cancer patients and they concluded controversial results. We aimed to investigate the correlation of BMI and total cholesterol levels with histopathological grading in breast cancer patients with regard to menopausal status. Total cholesterol was measured using Qimica kit/Spain and data were analyzed using suitable statistical tests. P-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. We found a significant relationship between BMI and tumor grading (P = 0.008). The correlation was observed in postmenopausal patients (P = 0.01) with no correlation in premenopausal patients (P = 0.32). Also, there was a significant correlation between total cholesterol and tumor grading (P = 0.003) only in postmenopausal patients (P = 0.011) with no correlation in premenopausal patients (P = 0.32). There is a significant relationship of histopathological grading with both BMI and total cholesterol levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with hypoxia playing a crucial role in its progression. Hypoxia, defined as reduced oxygen availability, is a hallmark of solid tumors and particularly influences the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. Under hypoxic conditions, tumors activate a variety of molecular responses that promote survival, including the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). These transcription factors regulate the expression of pro-angiogenic genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which drive angiogenesis and support tumor growth. However, the vasculature formed under hypoxic conditions is often dysfunctional, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. This review explores the mechanisms by which hypoxia drives angiogenesis in breast cancer, emphasizing the roles of HIFs, VEGF signaling, and metabolic reprogramming. Angiogenesis, a critical process for tumor survival and growth, is primarily mediated by the induction of VEGF under hypoxic conditions. VEGF acts on endothelial cells to promote blood vessel formation, ensuring the tumor receives sufficient oxygen and nutrients. However, the vessels formed are typically leaky and inefficient, exacerbating the hypoxic environment and perpetuating a cycle of tumor progression. The metabolic reprogramming that occurs in hypoxic tumor cells, such as the shift toward glycolysis (the Warburg effect), also plays a pivotal role in sustaining angiogenesis. The resulting acidic conditions further enhance VEGF production and endothelial cell migration, supporting continued tumor growth and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant concern in cancer patients, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as additional healthcare burdens. While advances in cancer treatment have expanded survival rates, they have also been associated with an elevated risk of VTE, complicating the clinical landscape. This article explores the challenges posed by cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT) management, particularly the dilemma of administering anticoagulation therapy in cancer patients with a heightened bleeding risk. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in reducing symptomatic VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, the lack of a universally accepted risk-stratification model in clinical practice has hindered its routine adoption. Among the existing models, the Khorana score is commonly used but is not definitively superior to others. Moreover, concerns over the absence of substantial survival benefits, metastasis-free survival differences, and the potential for increased bleeding risk have deterred the routine use of thromboprophylaxis in this population. Recent insights from the TARGET-TP trial, which employed a biomarker-driven risk assessment model based on fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, challenge these concerns. The trial demonstrated improved 6-month mortality rates without an associated increase in bleeding risk in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients. However, the trial's limited inclusion of lung and GI cancer patients necessitates further investigation to establish broader applicability. This article underscores the need for refined risk assessment models, evaluates the implications of the TARGET-TP trial's findings, and discusses the evolving landscape of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients.",

Additionally, we assess new inflammatory biomarkers that may be useful for both diagnosis and prognosis in these disorders. This review offers a thorough framework for clinicians and researchers to address the intricate relationships between cancer treatment, psychological functioning, and cardiovascular health. It does so by looking at the most recent developments in anti-inflammatory interventions, pain management techniques, and integrated therapeutic approaches.

We report a case of a 34-year-old Palestinian male with a history of hypertension and gout who presented with lower back and right leg pain. Imaging studies showed multiple lytic lesions in the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur, confirming the presence of a metastatic disease. A whole-body CT scan revealed an adrenal mass and an AAA.

Metastatic SMOS commonly impacts bones, including the pelvis, spine, and femur. While it is typical for cancer to spread to places like the lungs, the rare occurrence of metastasis to organs like the adrenal glands makes diagnosis and treatment more challenging.

Its preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and the lack of specific imaging criteria. Often, it mimics other diseases like cancers and infections, complicating early detection. A 51-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and a biliary stricture following stent placement presented with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss for 4 months. A CT scan revealed an indwelling common bile duct (CBD) stent, mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and pneumobilia. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure was performed with stent exchange. Initial CBD biopsy showed chronic inflammation, but both biopsy and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were negative for malignancy. A subsequent ERCP with additional biopsies also returned negative results for malignancy, though CBD brushing tested positive for M. tuberculosis. The diagnosis of biliary tuberculosis is challenging due to its nonspecific presentation. In this case, the positive result for M. tuberculosis in the CBD brushing led to the diagnosis, even after negative biopsy and FNA results. Early recognition of hepatobiliary tuberculosis is crucial as it enables conservative management with stents and anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Biliary tuberculosis, although rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained biliary symptoms. Timely diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic procedures can lead to effective treatment with ATT and stenting, improving patient outcomes, and preventing more invasive treatments.",

A 64-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for coughing, expectoration, and asthma for more than 1 year. Chest CT revealed localized thickening of the tracheal wall, and the bronchoscopy examination showed neoplasms of the trachea and bronchus mucosa. The lesion was characterized by sheets of histiocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and scattered aggregates of atypical lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical stains and T/B-cell gene rearrangement studies supported the pathological diagnosis of CSH-associated MALT. The patient remained free from the disease after lesion resection via bronchoscopy, with further treatment of targeted therapy. Pulmonary CSH-associated MALT can occur in patients of various ages and genders with non-specific clinical and imaging features. Histopathological examination is essential for differentiating CSH from similar conditions. The pathogenesis of CSH may relate to the overproduction of immunoglobulins, and the immunoglobulin types involved in the cases we described are predominantly kappa light chains. Recognizing CSH is essential for starting a clinical evaluation to identify the underlying neoplasm or associated causes. A conclusive diagnosis relies on pathological examination.

A significant breakthrough was the identification of Ouabain as an endogenous ligand of the Na+/K+ pump, transforming the pump's role from a mere ion transporter to a receptor within a hormonal signaling pathway. This discovery has linked the Na+/K+ pump to complex intracellular signaling pathways, with implications for hypertension, heart failure, and cancer. However, emerging evidence suggests that its role extends beyond cardiovascular dysfunction to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In epilepsy, dysregulation of the Na+/K+ pump contributes to altered ion homeostasis and hyperexcitability. At the same time, in Alzheimer's disease, its dysfunction has been associated with disrupted calcium signaling, oxidative stress, and amyloid-beta accumulation. Similarly, alterations in Na+/K+ pump activity have been linked to dopaminergic neuron vulnerability in Parkinson's disease. This paradigm shift offers exciting therapeutic possibilities for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, redefining the pump's significance across multiple disciplines of medicine.",

    "title": "Unveiling the hidden aggression: a rare case of uterine leiomyosarcoma and its diagnostic dilemmas.",
    "abstract": "Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy of the uterine myometrium, accounting for only 1-2% of uterine cancers. Due to its nonspecific presentation and the difficulty in distinguishing it from benign conditions, preoperative diagnosis remains challenging. Advanced diagnostic tools and clinical vigilance are crucial to improving outcomes for affected patients. A 39-year-old woman with a 3-year history of progressive abdominal pain and a palpable mass was diagnosed with a large uterine mass. Imaging suggested a pedunculated leiomyoma with potential malignant features. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a mass compressing adjacent structures, which was completely resected. Histopathology confirmed uLMS. The patient recovered well and had no recurrence at 6 months of follow-up. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of uLMS, which often mimics benign leiomyomas on imaging. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment, with histopathological confirmation being essential for diagnosis. Adjuvant therapies have limited efficacy, highlighting the need for personalized management strategies. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are essential for optimal management of uLMS. The development of improved diagnostic modalities and targeted therapies is necessary to enhance patient outcomes for this rare malignancy.",

    "title": "Burden of liver cancer in the European region from 1990 to 2021: a sub-analysis of the global burden of disease study.",
    "abstract": "Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In Europe, viral hepatitis, alcohol consumption, and metabolic diseases contribute to this burden. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we report here the liver cancer epidemiology in Europe between 1990 and 2021, describing recent trends, geographical disparities, and the major risk factors influencing disease outcomes. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 provided standardized data on liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across Europe from 1990 to 2021, utilizing advanced statistical modeling tools like DisMod-MR 2.1 to ensure accuracy and comparability. Age-standardized rates (age-standardized incidence rate, ASIR; age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR); and age-standardized DALYs rate, ASDR) were analyzed alongside the socio-demographic Index (SDI) to evaluate trends, regional disparities, and associations using joinpoint regression and LOESS modeling. Data visualization involved Python tools, including choropleth maps and regression plots. Liver cancer burden in Europe has increased significantly, with the ASIR rising from 3.04 [2.93-3.14] in 1990 to 4.20 [3.93-4.40] in 2021, the ASMR increasing from 3.08 [2.96-3.18] to 3.86 [3.59-4.05], and the ASDR rising from 78.48 [76.09-80.74] to 91.43 [86.48-95.79]. Males consistently showed higher rates than females, and older populations bore the highest burden, with deaths and DALYs peaking in the 95+ age group in 2021. Nationally, Andorra reported the highest ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR in 2021, while Ukraine had the lowest rates. Hepatitis C and alcohol-related liver cancer were the leading contributors, with NASH showing the fastest growth. Regions with higher SDI demonstrated greater burden, highlighting healthcare access and detection disparities. Liver cancer burden in Europe is driven by rising obesity, aging populations, lifestyle changes, and healthcare disparities, with incidence and mortality growing faster in the Europe, especially the Western region. Comprehensive strategies focusing on prevention, early detection, and equitable access to care are essential.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent malignancy of the urinary tract. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exert significant effects on various human cancers by targeting microRNAs (miRs). This study, therefore, probed the action of the LINC00152/miR-103a-3p axis in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and progression of BLCA. LINC00152, miR-103a-3p, and ADORA3 expression in clinical BLCA tissues were tested. LINC00152 was knocked down in BLCA cells alone or combined with miR-103a-3p inhibition or ADORA3 overexpression. The level of EMT- and PI3K/AKT pathway-related genes was assessed with Western blot. Cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and apoptosis were examined with CCK8 and EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Binding of miR-103a-3p to LINC00152 and ADORA3 was validated through RIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. The action of LINC00152 in BLCA progression was verified in vivo. LINC00152 and ADORA3 expression was abundant and miR-103a-3p expression was poor in BLCA tissues. LINC00152 knockdown or PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition repressed malignant behaviors and EMT of BLCA cells. Mechanistically, LINC00152 bound specifically to miR-103a-3p, which targeted ADORA3 and then activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. miR-103a-3p inhibition or ADORA3 overexpression nullified the suppressive impacts of LINC00152 knockdown on EMT and malignant behaviors of BLCA cells. Furthermore, LINC00152 knockdown decreased ADORA3 expression and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. LINC00152 knockdown upregulates miR-103a-3p to reduce ADORA3 expression, thus protecting against the malignant biological behaviors and EMT of BLCA cells.

    "title": "Prostate Cancer and the Rise of Focal Laser Therapies: A Narrative Review of Benefits and Limitations.",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in men and remains a major global health concern. Traditional treatment modalities such as radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy, while effective, often result in significant morbidity, including urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Methods: A narrative review was conducted to synthesize current evidence on focal laser therapy for prostate cancer. A comprehensive literature search was performed across three major databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search strategy employed the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords: (\"Prostatic Neoplasms\" [MeSH] OR \"prostate cancer\") AND (\"Laser Therapy\" [MeSH] OR \"laser ablation\" OR \"focal therapy\"). The search was limited to studies published between 2000 and 2024. Results: The initial search retrieved 1,444 articles. After a rigorous screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, 79 studies met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the review. The selected literature enables a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state of research on focal laser therapy in the management of prostate cancer. Conclusion: While focal laser therapies offer promising outcomes with fewer side effects, their long-term efficacy and survival benefits remain uncertain. High-quality studies with long-term follow-up are essential to better define their role in the prostate cancer treatment landscape and inform optimal patient selection.",

    "abstract": "Clear aligner orthodontic treatment provides a hygienic and esthetic alternative to fixed appliances; however, the required resin attachments can promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk of white-spot lesions in enamel. This study aimed to develop a novel resin-based antibacterial and bioactive orthodontic clear aligner attachment and evaluate its mechanical and antibacterial properties. A resin matrix composed of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and triethylene glycol divinylbenzyl ether (TEG-DVBE) was modified with 3% dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) for antibacterial effects and nano-amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) to support remineralization. Transbond™ LV and Vitremer™ were selected as commercial controls. Mechanical properties (flexural strength, elastic modulus, microhardness, and shear bond strength), degree of conversion, and antibacterial performance against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilms were assessed through colony forming units (CFU), biofilm metabolic activity (MTT), and lactic acid production. All experimental groups showed flexural strength of 100.6-109.2 MPa, exceeding the ISO standard for resin-based materials. Degree of conversion in experimental groups ranged from (53.4 ± 2.3 to 69 ± 0.9) %, significantly exceeding (47.5 ± 0.1) % for Transbond control (p < 0.05). Hardness was (0.21 ± 0.03) GPa for Transbond control, statistically comparable to (0.20 ± 0.02) GPa for the 20% NACP + 45% glass group. All experimental groups achieved a 6-log reduction in biofilm CFU and 90% reduction in metabolic activity and lactic acid production vs. controls (p < 0.01). This novel clear aligner attachment resin exhibits promising mechanical strength, high degree of conversion, potent antibacterial effects, and ion releases to potentially reduce white-spot lesions during clear aligner treatment.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a highly prevalent and significantly lethal digestive malignancy worldwide. This study aims to reveal the evolution of the disease burden of CRC associated with a low-grain diet from 1990 to 2021, to predict future trends, and to provide a scientific basis for differentiated prevention and control strategies. The study integrated GBD 2021 data covering 204 countries and territories to assess the disease burden of CRC associated with a low-grain diet by the number of deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), and Age-standardized DALYs rates (ASDR). Trends were quantified using Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) and disease burden was projected to 2050 using Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) modeling. Decomposition analyses explored the impact of population growth, aging, and epidemiologic changes on burden. Between 1990 and 2021, the number of CRC deaths associated with a low proportion of whole grain diets worldwide increased by 82.94%, and disability adjusted life years increased by 70.3%. There is significant heterogeneity between regions: regions with high Social Population Index (SDI) have the highest decrease rate, while regions with low to medium SDI have the fastest increase rate. Age analysis shows that the disease burden is highest in the 50-85 age group, with males having a significantly higher risk than females. The BAPC model predicts that by 2050, global ASMR and ASDR will further decline, and decomposition analysis shows that population growth is the main reason for the increase in burden. Age-standardized mortality rates and ASDR for CRC due to low whole grain diets declined globally between 1990 and 2021, but the absolute number of cases continues to increase. Low whole grain diet is an important modifiable factor in the disease burden of CRC, with significant age, sex, and regional heterogeneity in its impact. Bayesian BAPC model predictions showed a decreasing trend in ASMR and ASDR for colorectal cancer disease burden associated with low grain diets, but the absolute burden continued to increase due to increased aging. Decomposition analyses showed that population growth was the main cause of the increasing burden.",
